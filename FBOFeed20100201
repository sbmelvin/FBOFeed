<DESC>RECOVERY - Horizon Scanning System

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis for a contract to establish a Horizon Scanning System, to be funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds.  This is a new requirement and there is no incumbent.

The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available by downloading from the Internet through www.fedbizopps.gov or through the AHRQ website at www.ahrq.hhs.gov.  Interested offerors are responsible for monitoring these sites for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for downloading on or about 15 days after publication of this synopsis.

ARRA appropriated $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research (CER), of which $300 million is allocated to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The goal of CER is to improve health outcomes and the quality of care by providing evidence to inform and enhance medical decisions made by patients and their medical providers.  AHRQ is using ARRA funds to expand and broaden current CER activities and to support new initiatives in CER.  This solicitation presents AHRQ’s effort to implement its own horizon scanning system in order to identify new and emerging issues for comparative effectiveness investments through the Effective Health Care (EHC) Program.  Horizon scanning involves: 1) the identification and monitoring of new and evolving healthcare interventions that are purported to or may hold potential to diagnose, treat or otherwise manage a particular condition; and 2) an analysis of the relevant healthcare context and landscape in which these new and evolving interventions exist in order to understand their potential impact on clinical care, the healthcare system, patient outcomes, and costs.  This project will provide AHRQ with a systematic process to identify and monitor healthcare technologies that are likely to have a high clinical, system and cost impact in the US.  The AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System shall be informed by existing methods but incorporate novel and innovative approaches.

The purpose of this project is to meet an immediate need at AHRQ to establish a horizon scanning system.  Through this procurement, AHRQ seeks to quickly and efficiently implement a horizon framework and infrastructure to immediately generate information that will inform comparative effectiveness research investments through the Effective Health Care (EHC) Program.  It is expected that a majority of the effort necessary to accomplish the required tasks below will be dedicated to the implementation of a horizon scanning system and to the actual conduct of horizon scanning.

The performance requirements of this solicitation are as follows:
•	Refine and implement a protocol to identify and monitor new healthcare technologies.
•	Refine and implement a methodology to forecast the future clinical, system, and cost impact of identified technologies.
•	Report on findings from horizon scanning activities (through scheduled, periodic status updates and topical reports requested by AHRQ).
•	Review methods of horizon scanning used by public and private organizations in the US and internationally.  
•	Develop a plan to evaluate the implemented horizon scanning protocol and methodology.

Methods proposed by the Offeror to accomplish the above tasks shall be based on a justified scientific rationale, and the Offeror shall demonstrate an understanding of horizon scanning methods.  The Offeror shall also demonstrate familiarity with and understanding of its proposed healthcare horizon scanning methods, and personnel shall have experience relevant to implementing proposed methods.  Additionally, Offerors shall demonstrate the capacity to implement their proposed technical approach to the above performance requirements from a management perspective.  Consideration will be given to the Offeror’s demonstrated ability to quickly and efficiently implement its proposed methods as well as the Offeror’s ability to provide substantive status updates and in-depth reports on its horizon scanning activities.  Offerors shall demonstrate the ability to implement horizon scanning protocol and methods as well as produce written reports that are scientifically and methodologically rigorous.  Offerors shall also demonstrate the capacity to conduct horizon scanning over the two-year performance period of contract and quickly respond to requests for additional reports at the request of AHRQ.  

The Project Team shall consist of a Project Manager, Project Director, and other key staff, which can include subcontractors and/or consultants.  

The Project Director shall have, at minimum, a doctoral or medical degree and have demonstrated knowledge of healthcare technology innovation and diffusion in the context of the US healthcare system and experience overseeing projects involving the development and assessment of relational data.  Additionally, the Project Director shall not have less than ten (10) years of total work experience which includes: 1) demonstrated skills in organizing and monitoring complex projects conducted by groups of diverse professionals; 2) knowledge of payer (including Medicare) policies; and 3) knowledge of FDA regulatory requirements for drugs, devices and biologics.

The Project Manager shall have training and experience in health services research, development and implementation of quality improvement strategies and personnel/project management.  In addition, the Project Manager must have experience in working with diverse groups such as innovators, healthcare providers and purchasers, clinical and health service researchers, and healthcare policymakers.  The Project Manager shall have, at a minimum, a Master’s degree in a health and human services-related specialty and at least ten (10) years total work experience which includes: 1) at least eight (8) years in a health-related field; and 2) demonstrated skills in organizing and monitoring complex projects conducted by groups of diverse professionals.

Other key staff shall also have demonstrated experience in developing and analyzing relational data; working with issues related to healthcare technology innovation and diffusion in the US; payer (including Medicare) policies; and FDA regulatory policies.  

AHRQ anticipates awarding one firm, fixed-priced contract under this solicitation for a period of 2 years and 3 option years.  Proposals will be evaluated inclusive of the options.  The Government is under no obligation to exercise the options either at award or at a later date.

<DESC>1. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION
<p>DARPA is soliciting innovative research and development (R&amp;D) proposals to advance the production of Gradient Index (GRIN) lenses from Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 8.  Proposed R&amp;D should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary and fundamental advances in the design and fabrication of 3-dimensional GRIN lenses with arbitrary design flexibility for both imaging and non-imaging systems.</p>
<p>1.1. PROGRAM OVERVIEW<br />Optical elements (lenses) perform a variety of functions in military systems, ranging from image formation to light projection or light collection.  The performance of these systems is frequently limited by their optical elements, which dominate system weight and cost, and force tradeoffs between system parameters such as focal length, field of view (or acceptance angle), resolution, and range.</p>
<p>Conventional lenses are ultimately limited by geometry.  Available design parameters are a single bulk index of refraction (n) per lens element and variations in the element surface profile, including continuous surfaces (lens curvature) and/or discontinuous surfaces (diffractive optics).  Light rays undergo refraction at the surfaces of each element, but travel in straight lines within the lens.  Since the design space of conventional optics is limited to a combination of bulk refractive index and surface structure, correcting for aberrations (for example through the use of achromatic or diffractive optics) leads to large, heavy, complex designs, and/or greater losses, lower image quality, and manufacturing difficulties.</p>
<p>GRIN lenses, as the name implies, are optical elements whose index of refraction varies within the lens.  Control of the internal refraction allows the steering of light in curved trajectories  through the lens.  GRIN optics thus increase the design space to include the entire volume of the optical elements, providing the potential for dramatically reduced size, weight, element count, and assembly cost, as well as opening up new trade space between performance parameters.  However, past efforts to make large aperture GRIN lenses have had limited success due to restricted refractive index change, poor control over index profiles, and/or severe limitations in lens diameter.</p>
<p>Recent breakthroughs in material science have led to at least one method for developing large (&gt;10 mm) GRIN lenses with 3-dimensional gradient index profiles. The feasibility of adding additional capabilities to the GRIN lenses, including controlled expansion, contraction, and shear (for variable focus lenses or asymmetric optical variations) has also been demonstrated.  Additionally, recent advances in transformation optics and computational power provide DARPA with a unique opportunity to assemble design and fabrication elements within integrated teams to advance the utility and availability of GRIN lenses across the full range of military optics-dependent systems.</p>
<p>The Manufacturable GRIN Optics (M-GRIN) program seeks to advance GRIN design and fabrication technology from Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 8 (see Appendix 2).  This program will develop new lens design methods and tools coupled to fabrication processes and manufacturing tolerances that will provide a pathway to a scalable manufacturing system which can flexibly produce lenses in units of 1 to thousands.</p>
<p>To meet the program goals, DARPA seeks innovative proposals for the M-GRIN program to design, fabricate, and demonstrate manufacturing feasibility of GRIN-based optical assemblies for a high-performance color camera lens and a two-color solar concentrator (see section 1.2 for performance specifications).  Proposals are expected to address all of the following technology areas: 1) materials development, 2) optical element design, 3) test and evaluation methods (metrology), and 4) manufacturing.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPENCOMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
BACKGROUND:  
For the past several years Lake Clark National Park & Preserve has contracted with CLS America to provide the service of downloading satellite tracking from the ARGOS satellite embedded in Lake Clark National Park & Preserve radio collars. This contract is to continue tracking wolves collared via satellite within Lake Clark National Park & Preserve.												1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   CLS America has proprietary rights to ARGOS satellite transmittals.  ARGOS satellite signals were, in another previous contract, imbedded in Lake Clark National Park & Preserve radio collars.  The service required, to download and process ARGOS satellite data, is only provided by one company, CLS America.  CLS America, 1441 McCormick Drive, Suite 1050, Largo, MD 20774, 301-925-4411
2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: The service required is to collect and transmit data monthly from the ARGOS satellite, to the Lake Clark NP&P program manger via email.  The ARGOS transmitter is located in Lake Clark NP&P radio collars.  CLS America is responsible to reformat the satellite transmittals, process the data and then electronic deliver it to Lake Clark NP&P.
3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):  This service is proprietary to ARGOS; CLS America has proprietary rights to this service.
4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  
The market research included searching the CCR database for potential vendors.  Within the State of Alaska alone there were the following vendors listed with NAICS Code 518210 (Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services): Small Businesses: 59; Service Disabled Veteran Businesses: 31; Hubzone Businesses: 8; Large Businesses: 78; Women Owned Businesses: 14; Veteran Owned Businesses: 5.  Although there appeared to be potential vendors, the ARGOS website indicated CLS America had proprietary rights to the ARGOS data transmittals.  To verify, an email was written to CLS America asking if they were the sole provider of this service.  CLS America responded and indicated they were the sole provider of this service.  An additional inquiry phone call to Telonics indicated CLS America was the sole provider of this service.  ARGOS currently has an agreement with CLS America, they currently have proprietary rights to this service with ARGOS.
5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: The National Park Service previously purchased radio collars to study dall sheep.  Later, the NPS had the collars refurbished to add the ARGOS satellite chip meant specifically for this wolf project.  This contract is not to refurbish radio collars with new satellite transmitters, it is to download and read the satellite information that is transmitted via ARGOS satellite.
6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers for competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  
The National Park Service will perform market research with each new submitted request for this service.

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is interested in White Papers for long and short term Research and Development (R&D) projects that offer potential for advancement and improvements in the implementation of shipboard Integrated Power Systems (IPS) at the major component, subsystem and system level.  IPS provides total ship electric power including electric propulsion, power conversion and distribution, combat system support and ship mission load interfaces to the electric power system.  The flexibility of electric power transmission allows power generating modules with various power ratings to be connected to propulsion loads and ship service in any arrangement that supports the ship's mission at the lowest total ownership cost (TOC).  Systems engineering in IPS is focused on increasing the commonality of components used across ship types and in developing modules that will be integral to standardization, zonal system architectures, and generic shipbuilding strategies with standard interfaces that are Navy controlled.  The modules or components developed will be assessed for applicability both to next generation shipboard electrical architectures and combat systems and to back-fit opportunities that improve the energy efficiency and mission effectiveness in the current fleet.  NAVSEA wishes to continue to improve IPS by performing analysis, modeling and simulation, life cycle cost analysis, producibility studies, module development, ship integration, architecture design, ship electric architectures and support for high power weapons systems requirements, and related efforts.  An evaluation of emerging technologies for ship applications (such as fuel cells, support for high energy weapons, support for high power radars, high-speed generators, and advanced power electronics) to determine future feasibility and development requirements will be conducted.  The approach to hardware developed under this BAA is that it fosters modularity and scalability (so that families of products may be leveraged to multiple potential applications) and shall accommodate an open system architecture where interfaces are well defined and mutually accepted.
Electric Ships Office:  The Navy has initiated the Next Generation Integrated Power Systems (NGIPS) effort with centralized leadership by the Electric Ships Office (ESO).  The mission of the ESO (PMS 320, organizationally a part of the Program Executive Office - Ships) is to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable, and more capable ship's power systems for all Navy platforms by defining open architectures, developing common components, and focusing Navy and industry investments.  The ESO will provide leadership of the developments identified as part of this BAA, will direct the transition of associated technologies developed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and will manage the technology portfolio represented by Program Element (PE) 0603573N (Advanced Surface Machinery Systems) for transition into existing and future Navy ships.  The guiding document that will be used to define the module developments that advance the NGIPS vision is the Next Generation Integrated Power System (NGIPS) Technology Development Roadmap, Naval Sea Systems Command Ser 05D/349 of 30 Nov 2007, which is publicly available under announcement N00024! 08R4123.	NGIPS:  The areas of focus for White Papers and Proposals submitted in response to this BAA should include, but are not limited to, the analysis, development, risk reduction and demonstration of future shipboard electric power systems and components, emphasizing shipboard power generation, propulsion, conversion, distribution and control; power quality, continuity, and system stability; electric power system/component level modeling and simulation; energy storage technologies; electrical system survivability; simplicity and ruggedness.  The Integrated Power Architecture provides the framework for partitioning the equipment and software of NGIPS into modules and defines functional elements and the power/control and information relationships between them.  For power generation, high power distribution, propulsion, and large loads, the NGIPS architecture includes Medium Voltage AC power (with emphasis on affordability), High Frequency AC power (with emphasis on power density in the near term), and Medium Voltage DC power (with emphasis on power density and fault management in the far term).  For ship service electrical loads, NGIPS includes zonal electrical distribution which may be either AC or DC, depending upon the specific application.  In addition to a full IPS implementation, modules that support a paritally integrated power system, or Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) where mechanical propulsion is augmented by rotating machinery off of the propulsion train for propulsion, or additional power generation shall be considered.  Also of particular interest are technologies that result in significant energy efficiency and/or carbon footprint improvements over existing propulsion and power system technologies.  The NGIPS roadmap partitions the power system components functionally into modules.  Those modules, subsystems and systems of interest include the following.
Power Generation Module (PGM):  A Power Generation functional element converts fuel into electrical power. The electrical power is transferred to one or more Power Distribution functional elements.  An associated Power Generation module might typically consist of a gas turbine or diesel engine, a generator, a rectifier (either active or passive), auxiliary support sub-modules and module controls. Other possible technologies include propulsion derived ship service (PDSS), fuel cells, or other direct energy conversion concepts.  Power Generation concepts include 60 Hz wound rotor synchronous generator driven directly by a marine gas turbine (up to 30 MVA rating); 4 pole, 120 Hz, commercially derived or militarized design variants of the above; and higher speed, higher frequency, high power density variants of the above with high speed or geared turbine drive.  The specific design issues to be considered include fuel efficiency, machine insulation system characteristics, size, weight, cost, maintainability, availability, harmonic loading, voltage, power, fault protection, interface to main or ship service bus, and commercial availability.
Power Distribution Module (PDM):  A Power Distribution functional element transfers electrical power between other functional elements. Fault protection systems should be designed, if possible, to not require the power distribution modules to communicate control signals with any functional element other than system control. An associated Power Distribution module might typically consist of bus duct, cables, switchgear and fault protection equipment.
Power Conversion Module (PCM):  A Power Conversion functional element converts electrical power from one form to another.  An associated Power Conversion module might typically consist of a solid state power converter and/or a transformer.  Advanced topologies and technologies, such as the application of wide band gap devices, will be considered.
Power Load Module (PLM):  A Power Load functional element is a user of electrical power received from one or more Power Distribution functional elements. The area of interest for NGIPS in the Power Load is the load interface definition and the provision of specialty power to optimize that load interface.  Among the special load interfaces that would require development are support for pulsed power weapons and sensors such as radar power supplies, electromagnetic launchers (for example EM Railgun), and advanced laser systems, all of which would benefit from optimized integration with the shipboard power system.  This would enable real time data and asset management and reconfiguration based on demand.
Propulsion Motor Module (PMM):  Electric propulsion motors and propulsion motor drives are large electrical loads as well as NGIPS modules.  Candidate propulsion motor concepts include Permanent Magnet Motors (radial air gap, axial air gap, or transverse flux), Induction Motors (wound rotor or squirrel cage), Superconducting field type (homopolar DC or synchronous AC).  The drivers and issues associated with these designs include acoustic signature, noise (requirements, limitations, modeling, sources, and mitigation methods), shock, vibration, coolant temperature, manufacturing infrastructure, machine insulation system characteristics, commercial commonality, platform commonality, cost, torque, power, weight, diameter, length, voltage, motor configuration, and ship arrangements constraints.  Motor drives that may be explored include cycloconverter (with variations in control and power device types), pulse width modulated converter/inverter (with many variations in topology), switching (hard switched, soft switched), and matrix converter (with variations in control, topology, cooling, power device type).  Technologies for drives and rotating machines which allow the ability to operate both as a motor and a generator to facilitate a propulsion derived ship service (PDSS) installation or on a fully integrated power system to leverage the inherent energy storage in the ship's motion may be explored. Integrated motor/propulsor concepts may be considered either as aft-mounted main propulsion or as a forward propulsor capable of propelling a ship at a tactically useful speed.
Energy Storage Module (ESM):  An Energy Storage functional element stores energy.  A number of alternative energy storage technologies and/or configurations (location within the distribution system and capacity) may be considered for future ship applications, such as battery, capacitor-based, fuel cell, fly wheel, or superconducting energy storage. Shipboard power quality and continuity along with examination of the implications of future high power/pulse power loads on configuration/technology alternatives is critical.  Energy storage modules may consist of short term (micro/milli second) or long term (minutes/hours) energy storage applications which utilize a combination of technologies to minimize power quality and continuity impacts across the system.
Power System Control (PCON):  A System Control functional element consists of the software necessary to coordinate multiple other functional elements. A System Control Functional Element receives information from other functional elements and external (non-IPS) systems. Similarly, a System Control functional element may receive control commands from or negotiate control actions with external systems and other functional elements. System Control manages the power and energy flow within the ship to ensure power is delivered to the right load in the right form at the right time.  While various forms of power control have been implemented on commercial IPS ships, the survivability requirements for military ships combined with the pulse load characteristics for some of the loads described above will require more sophisticated algorithms than are commercially available.  A System Control functional element resides on an external distributed computer system and therefore typically does not include hardware elements (unless specialized hardware is required).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>RECOVERY.  The requirement of this project is for the procurement of a qualified construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary to provide for Renovations of the 10th and Eleventh Floors of the O’Neill Federal Building, Boston, MA.  The work includes, but is not limited to:

Renovate the entire Eleventh Floor and a portion of the Tenth Floor of the Thomas P. O’Neill Federal Building to allow the construction and relocation of several departments within the Public Building Service.  This project is the third in a series of phases to realign departments.
The O’Neill Phase III Project will involve the renovation of approximately 43,900 square feet, including approximately 36,100 on the Eleventh Floor, and 7,800 square feet on the Tenth Floor to construct permanent offices, work stations, conference rooms, and support spaces for the General Services Administration – Public Buildings Service (PBS).

Approximately two-thirds of the eleventh floor will remain occupied during the project, and will require a series of separate sub-phases to construct a portion of the final layout, relocate offices, work stations, support spaces, and occupants, and proceed with the next phase of work in the vacated space.  All construction phasing, activities, and access, including any temporary system shut-downs, must be fully coordinated and approved in advance by PBS and the Building Manager.  Construction is to be completed with minimal disruption to occupants and functions within the building.

The project will be funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, (ARRA), and must comply with all ARRA requirements regarding commissioning, energy conservation, and reporting.

It is a goal of the project to achieve as many LEED – CI credits as possible, by following the LEED Guiding Principles for Sustainable Existing Buildings.  
The contract performance period is approximately 420 calendar days.  The magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The NAICS Code is 236220.  Size standard is $33.5 Mil.  All individuals working on this project will be required to obtain security clearances.

Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit, and, whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.

CONTRACT INFORMATION</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">:<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">a. General</strong>: This proposed contract is for Architect-Engineer (A-E) staffing support for Construction phase Services (CPS) which will be procured in accordance with PL-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and implemented in FAR Part 36.6. <br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />The proposed A-E contract will primarily support the engineering/design of various projects primarily located in the Fort Worth District Offices located in Ft Worth, TX CPS for various military and some Civil Works projects which are generally within, but not limited to the Southwestern Division (SWD) regional boundaries (TX, LA, NM, AR, OK) to allow the flexibility of sharing capacity with other Corps Districts (outside SWD boundaries) and other Federal agencies in unique cases. This flexibility would only be exercised in unique cases (anticipate less than 10%). North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This announcement is open to businesses regardless of size. Contract Award Procedure: If a large business firm is selected for this announcement it must comply with the FAR 52.219-9 clause regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The subcontracting goals for the Fort Worth District which will be considered in the negotiation of this acquisition are: (1) at least 70% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB); (2) at least 6.2% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB); (3) at least 7% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with women-owned SB (WOSB); (4) at least .9% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with service-disabled veteran-owned SDVOSB; (5) at least 9.8% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with HUBZone SB.

One Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be awarded from this announcement for a cumulative amount of $25,000,000 with a Minimum Guarantee amount of $5,000.00 for the Base period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There will be a base period of 2 years with one option for a 3 year period.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />Only Architect or Engineering firms may compete for this contract per FAR 36.601-4(b).<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />Price will not be used as a criterion for selection. <br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />There will be NO design services included in this contract that the AE firm will provide as an A-E firm in their offices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The design will be accomplished by the individuals hired under this contract and will be working in the Corps of Engineers offices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a staffing contract, not a design contract.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest. The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">.<br /></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />b.

This flexibility would only be exercised in unique cases (anticipate less than 10%). North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This announcement is open to businesses regardless of size. Contract Award Procedure: If a large business firm is selected for this announcement it must comply with the FAR 52.219-9 clause regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The subcontracting goals for the Fort Worth District which will be considered in the negotiation of this acquisition are: (1) at least 70% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB); (2) at least 6.2% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB); (3) at least 7% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with women-owned SB (WOSB); (4) at least .9% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with service-disabled veteran-owned SDVOSB; (5) at least 9.8% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with HUBZone SB.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">There will be NO design services included in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest. The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">b. Nature of Work: The services necessary for each requirement will be negotiated and awarded as individual task orders. The Architect-Engineer (A-E) shall furnish all personnel, services, materials, supplies and supervision required to fully complete each task order. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">c. Contract Award Procedure: </span></p>

The U S Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistics Center, Small Boat Product Line is seeking potential sources to supply replacement parts for the U S Coast Guard's Response Boat-Small (RB-S) boat, the U S Coast Guard's Response Boat-Homeland Security (RB-HS) boat, the U S Coast Guard's 23' Utility boat and the U S Coast Guard's 27' Utility boat. The complete parts list will contain more than 360 parts, all of which shall be bar coded, packaged and shipped in accordance with Coast Guard specifications. The U S Coast Guard does not own provisioning or technical documentation for the parts to be solicited, therefore we believe only the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) can provide the required parts. However, if other sources have the capability to provide all or some of the parts under this requirement, they are invited to submit their capabilities, to include a complete list of parts to be supplied, including identification of the OEM of the parts and the part numbers. The Government intends to award at least one requirements type contract, consisting of one base year and four option years, however we will evaluate the possibility of making multiple awards based on the responses received from this solicitation. It is the Government's belief that only Safeboats International and their authorized suppliers can furnish the required parts and ensure the proper form fit and function of all components, therefore it is the Government intention to solicit and negotiate with Safeboats International and their authorized suppliers.  Concerns were given the opportunity to submit their capabilities in the Notice published on 10-28-2009.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.203-1 and HSAM 3006-302. For information regarding this acquisition, contact the Contracting Officials listed herein.**********

<DESC>The following questions are for market research for the television service to be provided to Nellis AFB and Creech AFB. If you are interested in providing this service, can you please provide information in the following areas? Thank you in advance.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What type of service medium do you plan to provide/use? Satellite, IPTV, fiber optics, cables, other? Please note that service must be provided to both Nellis AFB and Creech AFB which are geographically separated by approximately 55 miles.</p>
<p>2. What is the intended set-up/installation time? Target award date is 1 May 2010 The service start date must be on 01 October 2010. Will you be able to develop an implementation plan? Does 01 October 2010 (five months from notification) sound like an accurate start date?</p>
<p>3. How will your choice of service medium affect our future to upgrade? Are you aware of any direction the television service industry is moving? For example, will fiber optic cables be able to be upgraded and provide service ten years in the future? Again, for example, is IPTV strongly becoming the industry choice of service medium?</p>
<p>4. What is your intended process for medium installation? Do we purchase the equipment or is the &lsquo;lease/rental' included in a monthly service fee? Who will own the equipment once it is installed in place, and who will pay for removal at contract completion.</p>
<p>5. Can you estimate the fees for the service and equipment per month? We have approximately 1550 television service drops. This number may adjust before a solicitation is issued. In addition, please list estimated fees for installation of new drops, trenching, dish installation, or anything else that may be required to do an installation. Please mention if &lsquo;new installations' are per building, per room, or per television set.</p>
<p>6. Please list the channel line ups that you have available. Please also list the most common groupings of channels that you provide. In our solicitation we plan to ask for different channel groupings in different buildings. In addition, please let me know if any channels can be substituted/changed if the cost is similar.</p>
<p>7. Finally, we require a relatively small number of internet drops. The estimated number of internet drops is 8. Please let me know if your method of television service can provide internet service as well. If it cannot, would you be able to, and interested in, providing internet service through an alternate method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your response. If any information is required, please contact me. Again, please note this information is used for planning purposes and is not a solicitation. A solicitation is planned, and a site visit will be set prior to the issuance of a solicitation. A final note is that no GFP will be provided in the form of equipment or cables, either aerial or underground.</p>

<DESC>AIR MOBILITY COMMAND (AMC) MISSION INDEXED FLYING
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational and planning purposes only. Please note that the Air Force will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this request for information. In accordance with the AMC Vice Commander's charter for the HQ AMC Fuel Efficiency Office (AMC FEO), AMC FEO is in the process of conducting market research aimed at determining the commercial availability of a mission indexed flying system that will allow AMC to optimize flight planning and execution without requiring an onboard Flight Management Computer System (FMCS) or changes to current Computer Flight Planning (CFP) software. This is not a solicitation for competitive bid, nor will it obligate the government to any contractual action.<br />The Mission Indexed Flying performance requirements are as follows:<br />A. Provide cruise optimization options for various desired flight outcomes including minimum overall operating costs, minimum flight time, and minimum fuel burn for maximum range.</p>
<p>B. Optimize flight level prediction for cruise flight and holding / loiter operations.</p>
<p>C. Provide climb and descent optimization based upon transition from standard aircraft climb / descent IAS values transitioning to / from an optimized climb / descent Mach number.</p>
<p>D. Provide descent data to include descent planning information in terms of both optimal flight path angle data and miles to go to descend, to enable idle thrust power off descents at the desired speed profile.</p>
<p>E. Incorporate a functionality to enable pilots to compare current flight conditions to known conditions at another flight level to determine the most efficient choice.</p>
<p>F. Provide performance limit data (max FL, max Mach), based on current conditions.</p>
<p>G. Allow for pilot selectable (or AMC selectable) buffet protection levels.</p>
<p>H. Using the inputs of takeoff weight, departure airport altitude, destination airport altitude, Mission Index, Flight Plan Type (Departure to Destination, Departure to Enroute point, Enroute point to Enroute point, Enroute point to Destination), provide for a full flight profile solution including climb and descent, and step climb and descent when necessary, computed from solution of the equations of motion and Mission Index Optimization in cruise flight.</p>
<p>I. Provide the aforementioned capability for a selectable number of flight plan legs, each accommodating data input for distance, wind component, ISA deviation, selected FL or optimal FL, selected Mach or optimal Mach and buffet margin. Provide the total leg distance, total fuel burn, total flight time, flight level (selected or optimal), Mach number (selected or optimal), true airspeed, and groundspeed for each leg.</p>
<p>J. Display for a pilot selected required time of arrival (RTA) the computed Window of Opportunity for the flight which provides the pilot with the minimum flight fuel burn (longest flight time) and minimum flight time (highest fuel burn). From this data the pilot will be able to select any RTA between the minimum and maximum values. Compute a Mission Index solution which will achieve the RTA and provide the flight profile for the selected number of legs.</p>
<p>K. Provide an optional burn limit to the pilot that will allow an attempt to achieve the RTA, but limit fuel burn to a specific value. If RTA cannot be achieved within the selected burn limit, provide a Mission Index value that gives the closest flight time possible to RTA while respecting the burn limit.</p>
<p>L. Be compatible with existing electronics currently operating on the aircraft, but without interfacing with aircraft systems in any way.</p>
<p>M. Provide a software training package for each individual pilot, as well as an on-site training program for a small group of aircraft experts to be selected by AMC.</p>
<p>The information requested herein will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Should a future requirement(s) evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated the period of performance will be a 1 year base period plus 3 one-year option periods. Base year will begin with the C-17, option years are "to be determined". AMC requests any qualified businesses that are capable and potentially interested in providing a mission indexed flying solution please reply to this RFI stating their interest and attaching a capability package including the following information: 1) name and address of company; 2) company point of contact including telephone, fax, and email address; 3) identify business size (large, small, disadvantaged, women-owned, 8 (a), HUBZone, etc); and 4) information demonstrating the company's ability to perform the potential requirement as described above. Also, provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost for providing a mission indexed flying solution for AMC. The ROM should be an estimated cost per fleet type for the C-17 (est. 212 aircraft), C-5 (est. 111 aircraft), KC-135 (est. 460 aircraft), KC-10 (est. 59 aircraft), and C-130 (est. 430 aircraft). The capability package must be clear, concise, and complete and be submitted by 12 February 2010, 12 p.m. central via e-mail to Michael.davidson@scott.af.mil.

<DESC>1939 Flag Conservation, Restoration, and Mounting


The flag used for dedication of the Koen Building was found in 2009 in the attic during building renovation. It measures 34 x 65 inches, and is wrapped around a cardboard backing and placed in a 41 x 71.5 inch wooden frame with standard plate glass. The canton appears to have areas of bleaching or discoloration. Consultation will be necessary when the flag is dismounted and packed for shipping. 
Treatment includes photography on both sides, testing with water and solvents to determine what masking agents were used in the mount, vacuum cleaning, testing for colorfastness, testing of stains for solubility; mounting with a buffered acid-free panel, stitched, and covered with ultra-violet glazing. It will be displayed in an area where there is indirect sunlight and direct fluorescent lighting. Final shipping is not included in the proposed work.

If you would like to see a photo of the flag, you may contact Jackie Robinson at "jrobinson@fs.fed.us" or 479-964-7220.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes.  

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  

Accurate flowmeters are required for dispensers that sell gaseous fuels for use in vehicles. In a hydrogen gas dispenser, a compressor uses gas from a low pressure source to fill a set of pressure vessels (a cascade tube bank). Valves are sequentially opened to allow gas to flow from each cascade tube to the vehicle tank. As each tube is opened, surges of flow and pressure occur at the flowmeter in the dispenser. Wide temperature changes also occur at the flowmeter and totalized flow errors as large as 10 % have been reported. Another arrangement for refueling gas powered vehicles is direct compression with a reciprocating compressor that generates pulsatile flow at approximately 2 Hz creating a transient flow measurement problem at the billing meter.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology is performing tests on coriolis flowmeters.
NIST is contemplating purchasing coriolis flowmeters from various manufacturers to perform testing. The coriolis flowmeters will be tested in a system that generates transient flow conditions that simulate those occurring in dispensers used to fill cars with gaseous fuels, such as natural gas or hydrogen. For safety reasons, only simulants of the gaseous fuels (helium or nitrogen) will be used in the transient experiments, but the meter must handle 40 MPa pressures and have fast time response (<0.2 s). The totalized flow from the coriolis meters will be compared to a reference value calculated from a flow standard.

To be considered for the testing, coriolis flowmeters must meet the following required specifications: 
-Must measure gaseous nitrogen or helium and must have a full scale flow of at least 1.2 kg/min but no more than 2 kg/min;
-Must use a coriolis flow measurement method and be an existing product design (i.e. not a prototype);
-Must have a maximum pressure capability of 40 MPa;
-Must accept temperatures from -45 °C to +45 °C;
-The flowmeter must have accuracy of <1% of reading &#61617;zero stability over a range of 10% to 100% of its full scale flow;
-Must have a response time of <0.2 seconds;
-Must have NPT female, Swagelok VCO, or cone and thread inlet and outlet connections; 
-Must have a 4 to 20 mA and frequency (pulse) outputs. 

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334519, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company’s size classification in any response to this notice. 

Companies that manufacture coriolis flowmeters, meeting the above referenced specifications, are requested to e-mail product literature and a letter describing their abilities to carol.wood@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. 

The letter should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. 

Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 
1. Name and business size of the company that manufactures the flowmeters for which specifications are provided; 
2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the flowmeters, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address); 
3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such flowmeters; 
4. Indication of whether each instrument (including installation) for which specifications are sent to carol.wood@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s);
 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research.

All documentation must be sent to Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.  E-mail address:  CAROL.WOOD@NIST.GOV.

Submission must be received not later than 3:00 PM local time on February 15, 2010.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS CONTEMPLATED PROCUREMENT IS ANTICIPATED TO UTILIZE THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) OF 2009 FUNDING IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT RESPONSIBLE SOURCES CAN SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT.

All responsible sources are encouraged to respond to this notice; however, sources that do not respond shall not be precluded from responding to any subsequent solicitation.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks four Walk-in Environmental Chambers for performing concrete research so as to complement NIST’s world-class theoretical and small-scale experimental expertise.

Concrete and mortar experiments must be carried out in controlled environments, since concrete is a temperature and moisture sensitive material.  Storage for long-term experiments is also required to maintain certain environmental conditions over time.  Such chambers need to be large, fully automated (with temperature and RH recording) climate-controlled walk-in chambers. They will contain storage units for long term material testing and specialized benches for testing inside the chamber. Controlling temperature and humidity for more experiments will give NIST a higher degree of precision and allow NIST to separate environmental “noise” from actual material response and achieve the conditions needed for many ASTM standard tests. The flexibility to have four identical chambers is necessary for NIST’s Inorganic Materials Group to test and store samples from the same batch at various temperatures and humidity conditions, simulating hot or cold weather construction and controlling variables for better comparison to model predictions.

Responses from responsible sources should clearly establish capability of providing the Walk-in Environmental Chambers.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the Chambers, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that result would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

Requirements for the Walk-in Environmental Chambers are as follows:

•  Four walk-in environmental chambers that would fit in a total floor area space that is 43’ wide x 10’ deep. 
•  Internal height must be 8’ with most of the equipment for temperature control on top, outside the internal chamber.
•  Chambers must contain shelving for sample storage, workbenches for experimental equipment, and adequate 110V outlets 
•  Temperature range: 5 °C to 50 °C; maintained over time to ± 1°C
•  Relative humidity range: 5 % to 98 % RH; maintained over time to ± 3%
•  Fast equilibration to set conditions (temperature and RH) preferable
•  Steady state, no cycling needed
•  Ramp should be provided to allow entry of carts
•  Ports (minimum diameter of 4 inches) for cables to monitor experiments from the outside, placed on the door wall
•  Loading expected on floor: maximum of 650 lb/ft2. 
•  Digital controller with option for output to be connected to computer for recording
•  Sufficient inside lighting for experiments to be carried out and experimental instructions to be read and lab notebooks to be written in
•  Custom assembled to fit our area but offerors will need to provide references of similar chambers that they have built. Past performance will be taken into consideration.
•  The chambers will be delivered and installed at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.

•  Desirable Option:  One chamber could have mist spray or fogging capability, which would be desirable even if this means losing the humidity control on that chamber. 

Requested Information to be Included in Responses to this Notice: 

1.  Indicate whether your company manufactures or is an authorized reseller/business partner for a CHAMBER of any kind and, if so, please provide complete commercial specifications for the CHAMBERS that your company manufactures or sells, including the name of the company that manufactures the CHAMBERS, where it is manufactured, and detailed functional and performance specifications that the product meets.
2.

<DESC>Title: Torpedo Shell Damping Material Removal  This is a Sources Sought announcement for preliminary planning purposes.  No contract will be awarded based on this announcement.
Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) is looking for partners interested in demonstrating concepts to remove sound dampening material from torpedo shells.  These concepts can include new or existing processes or equipment.  
The torpedo shells are aluminum torpedo shells with an exterior protective anodized coating.  The sound dampening material is a neoprene rubber pad with embedded lead shot.  The pads are epoxy bonded to the interior of the shells using Philadelphia Resins, Navy Epoxy Formula DTNSRDC 2844-1102.  The demonstrated concept should remove this sound dampening material without damaging the anodized coating.
The demonstration should have the following goals:
1.	removal of rubberized damping material and epoxy bodying agent from interior of aluminum shells;2.	no damage to anodized coating or dichromate seal;3.	no change in material properties of 7075-T73 aluminum alloy shell section; 4.	process or equipment that can be limited to interior of shell and not effect powder epoxy paint coating on the exterior of shell section;5.	process or equipment that creates no or minimal hazardous waste stream; and6.	process or equipment that incurs less than 1 hour of labor per shell section to complete and less than 24 hrs total time to complete.
NUWCDIVNPT will provide coated torpedo shell sections and shell drawing for use in studying processes and equipment that aim to meet these goals.  The demonstrations should be able to show removal from individual shell sections or a combination of the two shell sections of interest.  The shell sections Outside Diameters (ODs) are tapered and sizes are: 	1.  20.7" to 18.5" outside diameter and 15.7" long2.  18.5" to 11.8" outside diameter and 20.5" long 
Interested parties must meet the following criteria:
1)  show that they have the self-funded capability of conducting a demonstration;2)  show that a reasonable concept exists for their demonstration; and3)  be able to schedule their demonstration within two months of acquiring the shell sections.
NUWCDIVNPT will not provide any funding for demonstrations but will pursue an appropriate agreement with any party meeting these criteria in good faith. 
As part of the agreement, the partner will be expected to share data and allow government personnel to review designs, demonstration plans, and to witness major demonstrations in exchange for use of the torpedo shell sections.  
All information will be protected as proprietary information under the terms of the agreement.  NUWCDIVNPT will ship the hardware to the partner, and all NUWCDIVNPT hardware must be returned to NUWCDIVNPT after the demonstration is complete.  Requests that meet these criteria will be filled in the order received, as there are limited assets available for these demonstrations.
This opportunity closes on 01 April 2010.  Mail, fax or e-mail your proposal to:

<SUBJECT>Sources Sought for a Ground-based Low-cost Pulsed LIDAR System for Measuring Atmospheric Winds
<SOLNBR>DTRT57-10-SS-0002
<RESPDATE>030110
<CONTACT>Stephen A Garanin, Contract Specialist, Phone 6174946126, Email steve.garanin@dot.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Acquisition Division is conducting market research for a requirement for a low-cost pulsed Light-Detection-And-Ranging (LIDAR) system to measure atmospheric winds.
<p>The Volpe Center has been making extensive use of a pulsed LIDAR system for supporting the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s NextGen development of improved procedures for more efficient and safe utilization of closely spaced parallel runways. These pulsed LIDAR measurements have included both aircraft wake vortices and wind profiles in an offline R&amp;D mode. The existing system the Volpe Center uses, while proven instrumental to the program, suffers from a number of deficiencies that makes it difficult to expand the scope of future studies within the current program plan:</p>
<p>A. High cost (&gt;$1,000,000)<br />B. High power requirement (&gt;10 kW)<br />C. Large size (approximately 50 square feet footprint)<br />D. Weight (&gt;6000 lbs)</p>
<p>These are the results of the system designed for long range (i.e., near 10 km) and the laser technology involved. In certain applications, the capabilities the current system offers is considered to be over-designed for a range of wind sensing needs of the wake turbulence program.</p>
<p>However, developments in LIDAR technology over the past 10 years have led to systems that are much improved in these four areas which theoretically could still maintain the minimal needs of the wake turbulence program, particularly in the wind measurement area. Since wind energy was the major application for these improved systems, their primary function was to measure the ambient wind profile up to the maximum height of a wind turbine. Some had the added flexibility to measure to higher altitudes and to measure the wake of a wind turbine. These developments in the wind energy field are actually necessary to potentially match the near-future phase of the FAA wake turbulence program needs, for example, to further enhance crosswind based wake turbulence alleviation procedures.</p>
<p>The system in its current off-the-shelf form shall meet the following specifications:</p>
<p>1. Eye-safe<br />2. Horizontal or 3D wind profile measurement to a minimum altitude of 1000 ft.<br />3. Maximum range of 2km.<br />4. Performing the wind measurements with a minimal update rate of 10 minutes<br />5. Minimum laser range / line of sight resolution of 100 ft throughout the wind profile<br />6. Resolve the direction of the Doppler shift along line of sight<br />7. Ability to resolve wind magnitude and direction under 2 knot winds<br />8. Wind measurements to at least 50 knots<br />9. Minimal velocity resolution of 1 knot <br />10. Documented measurement accuracy by comparison with a tower-mounted anemometer<br />11. Can be carried by two field personnel.<br />12. Transportable by a pickup truck.<br />13. Power usage less than 1000 W.<br />14. Unattended operation for one month minimum.<br />15. Capable of scanning in velocity-azimuth-display (VAD) mode with variable elevation angles to obtain horizontal / 3D wind profiles.<br />16. Capable of scanning in a range-height-indictor (RHI) mode for maximum accuracy for just crosswind or headwind<br />17. Low cost (less than 225K USD, including basic maintenance)<br />18. Networkable<br />19. Designed to operate in saline / marine environment<br />20. At least 0.001 radians scanner resolution (1 m at range 1 km)</p>
<p><br />The system will have the flexibility to be expanded / upgraded in the future with software modification only (i.e., the system capability can support future needs of the program without a hardware redesign) to obtain:</p>
<p>1. Aircraft wake scan at fixed azimuth and varying elevation; minimum update rate of 20 Hz.<br />2. Position-Plan-Indicator (PPI) scan of azimuth scan of 360&deg; at fixed elevation angle<br />3. Zig-Zag scan for axial detection of wake vortices or jet blast applications<br />4. Real-time storage of at least 128 point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Doppler spectra, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and standard deviation of winds.<br />5. Incorporates an automated laser check by either monitoring the monitoring pulse or scheduled hard target return characterizations.</p>
<p>Interested sources must submit a capabilities package demonstrating their past and current experience with supplies and equipment of this nature. Information provided should be detailed in the Areas above so the Government can assess the ability of your company to provide the described supplies and equipment. All Offeror capability information shall include: Customer (DOD Agency, other Government agency, private industry); Contract Number; for government contracts, the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) name, telephone and fax numbers; otherwise for private industry contracts point of contact (POC); contract value and type of contract; period of performance; and description of product(s).

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) <br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION</strong>
<p><strong>RFI REFERENCE NUMBER - AFRL011510RVSE</strong></p>
<p><strong>RFI for Space Capable, High Data Throughput, Processing and Mass Storage</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate is issuing this request for information (RFI) to solicit information supporting research and development of a special form of auto-provisiong optical network for space systems based on the Space Plug-and-play Avionics (SPA) concept. We are interested on feedback regarding the basic approach (referred to as "SPA-optical" or "SPA-O") and concepts that would contribute to the creation of a near-term testbed, especially for high-performance plug-in modules supporting scalable processing and mass storage.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>SPA is an approach for rapidly building spacecraft based on "plug-and-play" (PnP) mechanisms (see references [1] - [3]). This system is based on an interface-driven set of standards intended to promote the rapid development of spacecraft busses (platforms) and payloads. As such, SPA is an open systems framework, combining commercial standards (such as "SPA-U", based on USB and "SPA-S", based on spacewire) with carefully chosen hardware and software extensions necessary for modern real-time embedded systems (e.g. fault tolerance, higher power delivery, self-description). All SPA components are self-describing through extensible transducer electronic datasheets (xTEDS), supporting an infrastructure in which components are automatically discovered and networks self-organized.</p>
<p>The upper limits of performance in SPA are dictated by the transport physical layer approaches (e.g. 12Mbps for SPA-U and 600Mbps for SPA-S). SPA-O extends the limited transport bandwidth of copper-based transports through the addition of an optical transport system consisting of a number of single- or multi-mode fibers (e.g., twelve) with an industry standard connector (e.g., "MT"). To simplify the ability to accommodate arbitrary wavelengths and protocols, SPA-S is retained in SPA-O as a control plane (as well as electrical power and synchronization signals), allowing for the structured and automated provisioning for a network of SPA-O components. In the spirit of concepts such as GMPLS [4], the use of a copper "back-door" tandem connection network allows SPA-O to accommodate the widest variation in optical network components, when they have been "prepared" to appear as SPA-O components. This "preparation" usually involves the integration of an appliqu&eacute; sensor interface module (ASIM) with associated xTEDS descriptions of optical resources, and an optical transceiver.</p>
<p>SPA-O, as a scalable optical plug-and-play technology, is intended to support the rapid creation of networks in embedded aerospace systems having the highest performance requirements, extensible to WDM-capable elements with very high transport rates on individual wavelengths (e.g., &gt; 100 Gbps). The "plug-and-play" features permit complexity encapsulation, promoting the creation of high-performance complex components that appear simple. For example, a SPA-O mass storage device may appear to have a simple two-connection attachment to a network (e.g., a 25-pin micro-D SPA-S connector plus a 12-fiber MT connector), but could be capable of sustaining dozens of multi-Gpbs streams in flight simultaneously, each being possible on different fibers, wavelengths, and involving different transport protocols. SPA-O networks are expected to consist of some combination of the following canonical SPA-O device types:</p>
<p>1. SPA-O sensors. High-performance producers of data, such as imagers (panchromatic, hyper-spectral, radar, etc);<br />2. SPA-O transponders. High-performance radio or laser communications transceivers;<br />3. SPA-O mass storage units. High-performance (solid-state) storage systems<br />4. SPA-O processor units. High-performance clusters of FPGA-based, multicore, or other types of processors and processor arrays;<br />5. SPA-O switches. Optical cross connects, non-blocking crossbars, or other devices capable of supporting the flexible interconnection of SPA-O components.<br />6. SPA-O specialty/test devices. Other types of SPA-O devices supporting other functions, such as amplification, wavelength / protocol conversion, traffic grooming, and/or test and maintenance of SPA-O networks.<br />7. Null devices. Defined as SPA-S devices, interpreted as SPA-O devices having no optical transport connector, but capable of supporting elementary transport and control plane functions.</p>
<p>Networks built in the first generation SPA-O approach are therefore expected to contain autoprovisionable connections between several devices of the aforementioned canonical types. Each SPA-O component of this network is expected to support one or more SPA-O ports (with each port having a SPA-S and fiber transport connector). Transport can be through either the copper or fiber channels available. Of course, it is expected that the optical transport channels of the SPA-O network are always used when (1) available, and (2) data rates higher than 600Mb/s (the limit of the SPA-S network) are needed between SPA-O devices. It is expected that the capabilities of initial testbed network will begin modestly. The available bandwidth of the optical network may start at 400Mb/s and hit a higher throughput ceiling (e.g., 10Gb/s) over a 12-month period. Follow on versions of the network will increase the throughput from 10Gb/s to 40Gb/s, and eventually 100Gb/s (and higher). SPA-O suggests a type of service-oriented architecture where components and software applications offer and consume services. Services could be as simple as a permutation of fibers, as complex as managing a theater-wide communications network, or processing space-based radar.</p>
<p>Even as the first-generation (non-optical) SPA approaches have evolved as open standards, so too is the evolution of SPA-O expected to be a fully open technology to promote the interchange and interoperation of SPA-O components developed from the widest variety of sources. It is viewed that the perpetuation of proprietary formats are unhealthy to the emergence of future "super systems", in which the widest variety of high-performance components from a variety of suppliers can be freely intermingled in a grid-like matter. Just as the US interstate system of roadways were created to accommodate vehicles of all types for the forseeable future, it is the hope that the SPA-O project will accommodate the most advanced concepts for scalable processing and storage networks for the foreseeable future. It is conceivable that even a single SPA-O device (through future CWDM/DWDM and high-speed transceivers) could sustain bisection bandwidths well beyond several terabits/sec. Smart auto-provisioning applications, based on ideas already proven in first-generation SPA, could theoretically configure progressively more sophisticated components without an inherent need to redevelop the systems that contain them, to include the advent of all-optical routers and processors, seen in the present as hopeful but distant dream. Similarly, SPA-O networks could be developed to be resilient, auto-configuring to maintain desired qualities of service in the presence of faults and hazards.</p>
<p><strong>High Data Throughput Processing, Mass Storage on Orbit</strong></p>
<p>The architectural approach motivated by SPA-O raises questions worthy of reflection:<br />&bull; "How do we efficiently and quickly process the data for immediate use, or store the data for future use?" <br />&bull; How much storage capacity do we need? If we assume a ceiling rate of 10Gb/s, then any appreciable amount of time beyond 0.5 to 1 second will quickly saturate most solid state storage devices. So will we need to compress the data before it is either processed or stored? <br />&bull; If applications may have the ability to use more or less bandwidth depending on channel conditions/constraints and availability, how can scalable software applications be written to permit fluid amortization across scalable pools of storage and processing?<br />&bull; How do we embed the proper electronic descriptions within SPA-O components? What semantic infrastructure is needed to seamlessly admit these components dynamically into embedded systems?</p>
<p><br />One could envision examples of single on board sensors broadcasting data to a bank of processing cores for analysis, while compressing and storing in parallel on other channels, while yet other channels prepare analyzed data for export "off satellite". In the presence of restrictions, what mechanisms can be devised and exposed to give systems the ability to maintain reasonable service quality.</p>
<p>Other questions relate to the confining limits of orbital systems:<br />&bull; How small can we make these units? <br />&bull; Is it possible to have all the storage on a single printed circuit board? <br />&bull; Is it possible to make these devices sufficiently energy efficient to operate on orbiting platforms? Can we define energy awareness into components and applications, to permit sensible degradations in performance that maintain a reasonable possibility of salvaging mission requirements in the face of energy shortfalls?</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">Request for Information (RFI): Forecasting</p>
<p>Posted Date: 1 February 2010<br />Response Date: 1 March 2010</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong><br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process. This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future IARPA program, so that feedback from potential participants can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA. Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below.</p>
<p>Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA Program BAA and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Background &amp; Scope<br /></strong>IARPA is interested in methods that can be used to generate probabilistic forecasts for events of interest to national security decision makers, including political, social, and military events on one-month to one-year time horizons. IARPA is soliciting submissions on the following topics:<br />&nbsp; 1) Forecasting methods with broad applicability to events of interest that:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61548; Generate probabilistic forecasts ("there is a probability P of event E in time period T") that can later be tested against observed events for calibration and discrimination<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61548; Generate conditional "what if" forecasts ("if action A is taken, there is a probability P of causing event E in time period T"), across a range of possible actions, one branch of which can later be tested against observed events<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61548; Apply to forecasting problems involving sparse and/or poorly-structured data<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61548; Have empirical support from published evaluations of accuracy -- particularly accuracy relative to at least one other forecasting method, on the same forecasting problem<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61548; Are more accurate than individual expert judgment and group deliberation by experts<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#61548; Are not already reviewed in Armstrong,(footnote 1) or for which there have been subsequent changes in evidence or theory<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61548; Do not require sophisticated statistical expertise among users<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61548; Can be used in online environments</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2) Methods to generate accurate probabilistic judgments from large, widely-dispersed groups of human experts that are amenable to web-based elicitations, that generate more accurate estimates than the unweighted average of individual expert judgments, and that require at most a few minutes of time per elicitation per expert.

<a href="mailto:clindsay@intra.nida.nih.gov">LINDSAY, CAROL A</a>
<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Dr. Jonathan Miller, University Hospital, Case Medical Center, Director, Functional and Restorative Neurosurgery, Assistant Professor of Neurological Surgery, 11100 Euclid Avenue, HAN 5042, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.  The National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland requires specialized skills, expertise, facilities and equipment to be able to do the very specific research needed.  The type of studies being performed, neuroregenerative and neuroprotective effects of retinoic acid, require very specific types of equipments and techniques in order to provide results that are consistent with NIDA/IRP portions of this program. Dr. Jonathan Miller ran successful experiments using these technologies and thus matches the current requirement of NIDA/IRP using the same techniques for these experiments which will now provide a translational component to this work.  Dr. Miller's labs are currently set up with the highly specialized equipment required to perform the experiments required by NIDA/ IRP to further test this research.  Three different studies will be done to examine the neuroregenerative effect of retinoic acid.  The lab will examine if intranasal RA administration can improve motor function in stroke animals.  Examination of RA treatment to increase co-localization of BrdU and NeuN, Map2, GFAP or Nestin in the lesioned cortex and SVZ in stroke animals will also be conducted.  Also, examination as to what extent RA induces behavioral recovery, neuroregeneration, and BMP7 expression in the BMP7 -/+ vs. WT animals will also be performed.
The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NIHDA2010148 may be submitted to the NIDA, IRP, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 200, BRC Bldg., Rm 04A326, Baltimore, MD  21224, ATTN:  Carol Lindsay

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
1.   Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  USDI-NPS-Olympic National Park
2.  Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved:  
Work is to reconstruct a section of failed roadway at Mile Post 4.7 of the Hurricane Ridge Road in Olympic National Park, Washington State.  The road failed on January 18, 2010, and has thought to have occurred due to soil liquefaction as a result of seasonal heavy rains and site drainage conditions.  The roadway, built approximately 55 years ago, is constructed on top of a cut-and-fill roadbed.  The fill consists of native, fine grained material.  A 150 foot section of fill initially slumped and then slid into the drainage below, taking with it most of the roadway.  The remaining, narrow strip of roadway along the narrow top of the fill was compromised due to subsidence and the slide area continues to widen.  Vehicular travel, even for administrative purposes, is no longer possible. The road  provides the only access to the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center, located 12 miles away from the slide area.
The anticipated contract will provide for immediate stabilization of the slide, containment of sedimentation that is infiltrating a stream that passes through the fill through a thirty-six inch culvert, excavation and removal or stockpiling of the remaining fill, and emplacement of an additional culvert to supplement, or possibly replace, the existing one.  The site, which due to its location and prevailing conditions cannot be adequately secured except by Ranger-provided security, will be immediately stabilized and fenced.  The definitized contract will include properly engineered backfill, and a new asphalt surface. 
3.  A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value:
Work required will be to mobilize equipment and materials to the site, provide site security, complete site preparation, including removal of excess asphalt and necessary tree removal, excavate and remove up to 20,000 cubic yards of material from the site, begin preparing, delivery and stockpiling of structural backfill material, stream diversion, placement of structural backfill, placement of slope drainage facilities, place a culvert, repaving the roadway and other associated work
Work is estimated at $2.8 million.
4.  An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2)-Unusual and compelling urgency.
5.  A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:  
Public Health and Safety-The slide area is located at Mile Post 4.7 on Hurricane Ridge Road, Olympic National Park.  While the road has been closed within 200 feet of the slide area with a temporary gate, signage, by positioning pieces of heavy equipment on the road, and other flagging and barricades, it is impossible to keep the public out of the area except through posting a 24 hour Ranger guard at the site.  Construction fencing would be difficult to place and ineffective.  The slide is currently 150 feet along the roadway and 65 feet deep.  The crumbling, undercut pavement is in a continual state of movement.  It will remain in a state of movement and require a continual law enforcement presence until stabilization takes place.  The undercut edge of pavement presents a hazard to the public who have come to visit the site due to local and regional publicity.  Since the area cannot be adequately fenced and the park does not have the resources to staff a 24-hour guard at the site, the remaining choice is stabilization of the area which should occur immediately.  The alternative is significant liability exposure and adverse publicity.
Resource Damage-The failed slope has released 15,000 cubic yards of fill and sediment, including asphalt debris, into the Lake Dawn outfall, which feeds local stream channels.  The slope continues to release sediment in significant quantities and will continue to do so until stabilized by a contractor.  The NPS does not have the manpower, equipment, or skill to safely mitigate sediment release through stabilization of the slope.  Sediment releases have resulted in the degradation of downstream water quality.  Remediation must commence immediately.
There is significant pressure from the local community, Congressman Norm Dix's office, Clallam County and the Port Angeles City Government to repair the roadway.  The slide has appeared in news stories as far as Seattle, has been reported by National Public Radio, and it is likely that public pressure to reopen the road will increase.  This road provides access to the most visited winter site at Olympic National Park and is considered a significant local resource.  Local governments feel that significant tourism dollars will be lost if the road is not reopened as soon as possible.  If the National Park Service fails to act promptly, public pressure and adverse publicity is anticipated to increase.
The Federal Highway Administration has been consulted concerning mitigation and repair, and has advised the Olympic National Park Management Team that the situation represents an emergency.  They advised in a meeting with Park Management on January 20 that a letter contract be utilized to secure a contractor in the shortest time possible.
The Hurricane Ridge area is utilized by the park Natural Resource Management program for a number of scientific studies.  Various monitoring equipment is installed in the areas accessed by the failed roadway.  These studies cannot continue due to administrative access restrictions.  Monitoring equipment cannot be accessed.  There is potential for significant loss of research data.
Facilities at the top of Hurricane Ridge include a Visitor Center/lodge, bathrooms, concessions facilities with restaurant, ski lift operation, and support structures.  The snowload is currently in excess of 18 feet in some areas.  The primary electrical service to the various facilities is through a lengthy direct bury wire extended through the wilderness with a history of outages.  The heating system is an aging, oil-fired system.  The backup generator is a refurbished, temporary unit placed due to the recent failure of the primary generator.  The water system depends upon the availability of electrical power.  The level of risk exposure to structures and facilities is significant due to unmaintained snow load, potential for failure of the sprinkler system to function in the event of a fire, and potential for damage to the building due to failure of the heating system while unattended and inaccessible.
The Park will be unable to maintain plowing operations until the access road is reopened due to the inability to fuel and maintain snow plow equipment located beyond the site of the road failure.  This means, immediately, that NPS personnel will not be able to reach the facilities for maintenance or emergency purposes.  Without continual maintenance, reestablishing access after a long period without snow removal will require a significant effort.
The concessions facilities are currently being transferred to another concessions contractor.  Lack of access prevents the new concessionaire from assessing the condition of their assets and beginning management of their concession operation. 
6.  A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies:
After considering the options proposed by the park contracting office, including limiting competition under FAR 6.302-2 or use of a sole source 8(a) contractor, the program office feels that the most appropriate approach to ensure public safety, prevent further resource damage, and protect unattended structures and facilities is the a noncompetitive letter contract that will result in contractor mobilization in the shortest possible time. 
7.  A Determination By the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable:
The Contracting Officer will follow the procedures set forth in FAR 16.603 to definitize the contract and establish a fair and reasonable price.
8.  A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted:
While the work site, located near Port Angeles, Washington, is only three hours away from Seattle, the NPS has historically found that the "pool" of contractors willing to provide construction services is somewhat small.  The Project Manager considered vendors who had provided satisfactory construction services to the park in the past and informally determined availability, knowledge and expertise, and interest in the job.  Of the two vendors actually contacted, it was determined that the selected contractor provided the best service for the completion of this work. The selected contractor is local, with their construction office and yard located only 15 miles from the work site. This will result in reduced mobilization costs as well as the opportunity to complete timely site visits to establish the limits of the work. The selected contractor owns their own quarry, also located locally, which allows an immediate mobilization to crush and supply structural backfill. The selected contractor also has an immediate location for the legal and environmentally responsible disposal of the unsuitable fill material to be removed from the site. Further, the selected contractor has successfully completed work both for the NPS , Federal Highways and other governmental agencies.
The remote location of the work site and the lack of qualified and experienced contractors within the immediate area of the work site led to the selection of this contractor.
9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302-2 (9) (i) - (iii):

10.  A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  none
11.  A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required:
Approval for this non-competitive contract action has been requested only after consideration of the unique circumstances involved in quick re-establishment of access to the Hurricane Ridge facilities.  This office will support competition of future contract activities to the greatest extent possible under prevailing circumstances.
12.  Certification:  I certify that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (i.e. verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate:/s/ Carl Elleard, Civil Engineer  Date:  1/21/2010

<p>The purpose of this Modification 55 is to obligate an additional $100,000 in funding in support of Work Assignment 3-103 which has been previously issued. The period of performance for this work assignment will be from April 13, 2009 though March 31, 2010.</p>
<p>WA 3-103 is to support the development of tools and training aligned with the unique aspects of the ARRA for Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) State programs and the borrower community of the DWSRF. This support will include: (a) participating in and providing support to a full day working session with the DWSRF program to support the development of a program oversight strategy for the unique needs of the ARRA funds. The contractor shall provide its expertise in program management, financial management, auditing and risks, and data management; (b) developing a means to transfer data from the DWSRF's Project Management System to the Office of Management &amp; Budget's (OMB) Recovery.gov website; and (c) supporting two (2) web seminars on the DWSRF and ARRA. This support for the webinars shall consist of getting a web seminar service, managing registration, and recording questions and answers during the web seminars.</p>
<p>Amendment 3 to the work assignment added contractor support for the development of tools and training aligned with the unique aspects of the ARRA for DWSRF State programs and the borrower community. The contractor shall also provide support to the USEPA Headquarters and USEPA Regions to provide oversight of State programs for ARRA by: (a) Assessing data collection needs; (b) Collection of data from Communities and Inputting Collected Data; (c) Follow-up for Data Collection and Inputting; and (d) Region 1, 2, 5, and 9 State Site Visits and Project File Reviews. The current value of WA 3-103 is $247,517 with additional funds to be required for Amendment 3 to the work assignment.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

Third, in first quarter of FY2010 a Request for Information was published in FedBizOp to help GSA assess available technologies and potential approaches for the new ACMIS. The next step is get industry feedback on the ACMIS requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The General Services Administration seeks industry comments on the requirements and functionally for the new ACMIS. The attached spread sheet (Attachment A) provides the requirements. Please use the COMMENTS column in Attachment A for your comments, suggested changes, note clarifications needed and add any additional requirements you believe are missing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For your information, Attachment B provides the ACMIS data elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

This proposed procurement is for services/supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis to: Propper International, 520 Huber Park Ct., Saint Charles, MO 63304.
<p><br />SCOPE:</p>
<p>1.) The United Coast Guard (USCG) will be purchasing blue cargo shorts that will be part of a Coast Guard summer uniform.</p>
<p><br />2.) The USCG began this project by working with Propper International. The USCG bought a small quantity of cargo shorts for testing in Florida in 2008, and early 2009. After the wear test, the order was solicited with a Commercial Item Description (CID). The USCG received Product Demonstration Models (PDM's) from several vendors, all of which were unacceptable.</p>
<p>3.) Due to Propper International's previous design of the cargo shorts for the wear tests performed in 2008/2009, and the previous solicitations being unsuccessful, Propper is the best option to produce the cargo shorts to ensure delivery by summer 2010.</p>
<p><br />Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupy approximately 5,608 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease at 406 North Martin Luther King, Cleveland, Mississippi.  The Government intends on exercising a (5) year renewal option at this location. .  The delineated area is bounded as follows:

Other applicable requirements include:
	
-	Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)

-	Parking – 25 on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessor’s control

The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.
2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)

The primary goal of the Showcase is to encourage implementation of the field-proven MDSS technology. The three Showcases shall provide a forum for various public transportation agency champions to "showcase" their respective deployments of the MDSS technology. AASHTO is the only known source where funds can be provided to support to support the logistical support services and technical experts for the purpose of delivering the MDSS showcase. All responsible sources may submit a response identifying their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This is a Simplified Acquisition and the total estimated value is not to exceed $30,000.00.

Very good in all respects.  Advantages/strengths not offset by disadvantages/weaknesses.  Very good probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Government requirements.  <BR>Good<BR>Proposal meets most solicitation requirements and demonstrates a good understanding of the requirements but does not offer significant advantages to the Government over basic RFP requirements.  Disadvantages/weaknesses are not significant, unless significant advantages are proposed that outweigh significant disadvantages.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications, given by contractor, were acceptable.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government requirements.   <BR>Satisfactory<BR>Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements, but offers disadvantages (weaknesses) outweighing other advantages (strengths).  Examples may include little or no experience cited; weak proposal; mimics RFP language rather than expressing offerors approach or understanding of the RFP.  Probability of success considered less than full confidence.<BR>Marginal<BR>Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements.  Examples:  Proposal does not address all required RFP criteria; little or no experience to the extent that Overall quality cannot be determined because of errors, omissions or deficiencies that may be capable of being corrected without a major rewrite or revision of proposal.  Probability of success is questionable without further explanation by offeror.  <BR>Unsatisfactory<BR>Proposal demonstrates little to no understanding of the requirements; or approach fails to adequately meet acceptable performance expectations.  Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies.<BR><BR>The following rating will be used for Past Performance Rating:<BR>Risk rating<BR>Description of risk rating<BR>Very Low Risk<BR>Very high quality past performance.  Problems, if any, were negligible and were resolved in a timely and highly effective manner.  Performance was generally current and very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Governments requirements.  <BR>Low Risk<BR>Good quality past performance.  Minor problems may have been identified however; contractor took satisfactory corrective actions to resolve where appropriate.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Average Risk<BR>Adequate quality of past performance.  Problems may have been identified and the contractor usually took adequate corrective action.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Although performance exceeds expectations and was rated excellent to very good the projects submitted were generally semi-relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation.  Fair probability of success with an average degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Above Average Risk<BR>Rather poor quality of past performance. Problems may have been identified and contractor occasionally took corrective action, but not always to the owners satisfaction.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an overall above average risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>High Risk<BR>Unacceptable quality of past performance. There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature.  Contractors corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective.  Performance was current and very relevant to semi-relevant.  Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>Neutral<BR>No current and/or relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Government personnel were unable to identify any relevant Past Performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors.  This is neither a negative nor a positive assessment.  <BR><BR><BR><BR>The following rating will be used for Past Experience Rating:<BR>Risk rating<BR>Description of risk rating<BR>Very Low Risk<BR>Extensive amount of past experience in required areas of expertise identified in Performance Work Statement.  Detailed experience was generally current and very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Governments requirements.  <BR>Low Risk<BR>Good amount of past experience in required areas of expertise identified in Performance Work Statement. Detailed experience was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Average Risk<BR>Adequate amount of past experience in required areas of expertise identified in Performance Work Statement.  Experience was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an average degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR><BR>Above Average Risk<BR>Very little of past experience. Experience was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an overall above average risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>High Risk<BR>Unacceptable amount of past experience. Experience was current and very relevant to semi-relevant.  Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>Neutral<BR>No current and/or relevant experience record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Government personnel were unable to identify any relevant Past Experience information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors.  This is neither a negative nor a positive assessment.  <BR><BR><BR>The government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).

Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, OEM approved parts. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. As a minimum, the offeror (that is, the prime contractor) must possess a current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification or an Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with its proposal/quote. Evidence of other certifications, such as a Department of Defense (DOD) Certification, may be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Subcontracting, as it pertains to repair or overhaul of the specified components, is limited to concerns in full possession of the required certifications and must be identified with the offer.

Non-rework-able items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose. Should any of the repairable be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions. The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document. Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule. Delivery is required no later than 45 days after receipt of material. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to notify the Contracting Officer upon receipt of the repairable.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers for BPA01272101FILM<br />1. Can you advise me on the anticipated annual footage amount for processing, separated out by the two formats indicated - 16mm and 35mm?<br />The film is 7205 and 5205; they are 2994 perf for 16mm and 1886 perf for 35mm. We anticipate about 40K in footage annually. Process Classified and Unclassified and accomplish the film to tape transfer in High Definition since that is what the DoD is heading towards. The type film is ECN 5246 &amp; 7246 with remject backing. <br />2. Can you please provide me with the government specification referenced in "D"? Original ECN must be transferred in accordance with government specifications during a supervised telecine editing session.<br />The vendor should be able to process classified (willing to undergo a security screening process which elevates the facilities and the personnel, also personnel have to be willing to undergo security background investigations and sign non-disclosure agreements) and unclassified government coverage will also have a requirement of signing non-disclosure agreements. Personnel from Dept of Air Force will be physically present to dictate how footage can be masked as well as how film should be handled while in care of the processing facility. The film also requires special handling for processing of our original negative. At times this facility shall be required to do a quick turn process of motion picture footage.<br />3. Can you please define the Government Purchase Card in "Payment will be made via Government Purchase Card (GPC)?<br />Government purchase card will be Visa payment after services are rendered.<br />

<DESC>Questions and Answers:

1.. Will you consider inpection and cleaning performed by a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) as an alternative to divers?

Yes

2.  Can the reservoirs be drained in order to inspect, clean and disinfect?  This is an alternate methodology to diving for inspection and cleaning.

No, the tanks cannot be drained.   

3.  When was the last time the tanks have been cleaned?

Between 3 to 7 years ago.

4.  Can I visit some of the sites where the tanks are?  I would like to go up there this week. Will weather be a problem with visitng sites?

Because of the snow storm we recently had,  most of the access roads to the tanks are inaccessible and have 3-4 feet of snow.  The contractor may be able to access some of the tanks located at the lower elevation, but will need to make arrangements ahead of time to access sites, as they're behind locked gates, or he can walk in to the tank site.  Site Inspections can be arranged through:  Amy Terry and her email address is aterry@fs.fed.us or phone 909-382-2617.

<POPADDRESS>The actual survey sites are situated at specified Forest Recreation Sites or other locations on or near the National Forest.  Maps will be included to show the location of each survey site. 

Accessibility by motor vehicle is generally good.  All survey sites are reached by graded roads at a minimum, and paved roads in some cases.  Weather and wet road conditions could make access difficult in some of the more remote locations. 

The Sawtooth National Forest has several geographically isolated divisions on the South End and remote locations on the North End.  The Snake River Plain separates the northern and southern portions of the Forest.  This is important to consider when multiple surveys are planned for the same day.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that travel time and set up times are accounted for when multiple surveys are required in one day.

<DESC>This posting and the attachments represent an invitation to prospective offerors to respond with a quote for service needed at Hill Air Force Base. The government anticipates entering into a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with several contractors to supply service/repair to various ground equipment.
<p>It is the Governments intent to establish a Credit Card Blanket Purchasing Agreement (BPA) in which current/future requirements will be fulfilled by placing Call Orders against the BPA. The Government may issue a single BPA or multiple BPAs for the same or similar items to two or more contractors under this RFQ. BPAs may be established with large and small business concerns. Call orders to each contractor will be determined by the best value and/or delivery to the Government. Each Call Order against the BPA is not expected to exceed $25,000. The issuance of a BPA is not a guarantee of receipt of orders and can be cancelled at any time. The government reserves the right to terminate any or all BPA agreements by giving the contractors thirty (30) days notice.</p>
<p>At a minimum please quote all or part of the items found in the Statement of Work (SOW) section 6.0 using the attached quote sheet. If you have a catalog, you may provide it along with your quote. Any changes to the RFQ will be listed as an addendum through electronic media. The quote sheet shall contain the following information:</p>
<p>1. On each quote sheet circle the bomb lift or write in the diesel engines that you are quoting (a list of the required diesel engines is found attached to the Statement of Work). Quote each item as the example on the quote sheet. Only those items found on the Quote Sheet need quoted.</p>
<p>2. All work is in accordance with the revised Statement of work dated&nbsp;20 January 2010.</p>
<p>3. You will need separate quote sheets for each bomb lift, each diesel engine, and other parts (sections are specified on the quote sheets).</p>
<p>4. If you are not quoting on an item then leave it blank or put N/A in the corresponding blank.</p>
<p>5. Any quotes that do not follow this format will be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>6. Please note: The hoses will be quoted as a whole kit. An attached list with all hose part numbers is included with the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Each section of the quote sheet is divided into Labor Rates and Other Direct Costs (ODC).&nbsp; Please quote your hourly labor rate and a ceiling for ODC.&nbsp;You are encouraged to use your catalog for pricing. Please update with the current date and indicate how long the prices are valid. Please submit your quote using the attached quote sheets.</p>
<p>If your company has not filled out the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), please fill one out at https://orca.bpn.gov/.</p>
<p>If you are interested, you may participate by submitting your quote to Robert Maughan via email (robert.maughan@hill.af.mil), or by FAX to (801) 777-4569. It is the government's intention to issue the new BPA as a basic award with 5-year options. Initial BPAs will be issued in January 2010 for qualifying contractors, but the posting will stay open until 22 December 2010 to foster further competition. Any offer that falls within the competitive range and is considered technically acceptable shall be considered for a BPA. These BPAs may be established anytime throughout the year up to 22 December 2010. Quotes must be received by 5 Jan. 2010 to be considered in the January 2010 BPAs.</p>
<p>Due to the anticipated dollar thresholds involved in each call/order, this acquisition will be open to Large and Small businesses. Although, in the event that a call/order falls within the thresholds per FAR 13.003(b)(1), the specified call/order will be reserved exclusively for available small business concerns, as defined in FAR Part 19.</p>
<p>Contractors must be registered with the Central Contract Registration (CCR) to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DOD activity. Status of any contractor can be checked by calling 1-888-227-2423. Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements can be obtained by calling 269-961-5757 or via the internet at www.ccr.gov. If you have any questions please contact Robert Maughan at (robert.maughan@hill.af.mil) or (801) 775-2377.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA in support of the Joint Program Executive Office-Chemical and Biological Defense, Joint Project Manager-Guardian Product Manager-Force Protection Systems (PM-FPS) has a need for Increment 2 of an Automated Installation Entry (AIE) System that can automate the verification, authentication, and entry of personnel and vehicles into military installations. The Increment 2 AIE requirement minimizes the guard force requirements while maintaining or increasing personnel and vehicle throughput. It also enables adaptation of increased authentication requirements at increased threat levels. Increment 2 is totally independent of Increment 1 and will likely result in fielding of Increment 2 AIE systems at approximately 40 military installations throughout the United States. The capability primarily consists of integrated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products. The Government anticipates releasing a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about May 28, 2009 that will be open for thirty (30) days. It is anticipated that the RFP will result in a single-award, Firm-Fixed-Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract. The scope-of-work under this contract will include design, fielding, testing, training, and interim logistics support. The Government anticipates that the awarded contract will be for a one-year base period with four (4) one year options for a total estimated maximum contract value of $182 million. The estimated award date is August 31, 2009. This procurement is a full and open competition with small business subcontracting requirements.<BR><BR>Comments related to this synopsis should be submitted via email no later than 03:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on Friday, May 15, 2009 to the following Natick Contracting Division contact David.W.Mark@us.army.mil

If the Contracting Officer isn't available, please contact the Team Leader, Vivian S. Hubbs at Vhubbs@cdc.gov.</strong></p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct interviewing, data processing, and data file documentation for the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Interviewing shall be conducted from mid-2011 to mid-2019, based upon approximately 5,000 completed interviews per year with men and women 15-44 years of age in the household population of the United States. In summary, the contractor shall perform the following tasks, working in close, continuing collaboration with the NCHS/NSFG staff:</p>
<p>(1) design a national sample that will yield about 5,000 interviews per year with men <br />and women 15-44 years of age for up to 8 years (mid-2011 through mid-2019), a total of about 40,000 interviews), with oversamples of Hispanic men and women, Black men and women, and males and females 15-19 years of age; <br />(2) program and test questionnaires for males and females; <br />(3) prepare advance letters, consent forms, and other survey field materials; <br />(4) recruit, hire, and train interviewers;<br />(5) conduct all interviews in person, typically in respondents' homes, collecting signed consent for the interview for all respondents, and signed parental consent for interviews with 15-17 year olds;<br />(6) achieve a 75% weighted response rate for both men and women;<br />(7) Use laptop computers to conduct the interviews, and send the (encrypted) data electronically to the contractor's central office as promptly as possible; <br />(8) Prepare 3 public use data files based on every 2-3 years of interviewing <br />(a public use file must be based on at least 12,000 interviews);<br />(9) Prepare Series 1 ("Plan and Operation") and Series 2 ("Sample Design, weighting, imputation, &amp; variance estimation") reports to describe the work that was done.<br />(10) Keep the data safe, secure, and confidential.</p>
<p>Thus, this contract will require the collection of a wide range of complex and sensitive data, in person, in English and Spanish, from national samples. The data must measure trends &amp; differences among the total population &amp; important sub-groups, with a response rate that gives its users confidence in the results, and at a cost that NCHS can afford. The contractor must also meet requirements for Certification and Accreditation for IT security under FISMA and other applicable laws.</p>
<p>Further information on the survey is available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm.<br />Offerors are expected to be familiar with the contents of the web site and with Series 1, No. 48 ("Planning and Development of the continuous National Survey of Family Growth" and Series 2, No. 142 ("National Survey of Family Growth, Cycle 6: Sample Design, Weighting, Imputation, and Variance Estimation.") A Series 2 report for continuous interviewing will be released with the RFC.</p>

(Depending on the date of contract award, these dates may be adjusted.) Working closely and collaboratively with the NCHS/NSFG work team to develop materials and specifications, the contractor shall conduct all the necessary activities, including sample design, pretest, CAPI programming, hiring, supervising and training interviewers, data processing, data file preparation, and data file documentation, for a complete national survey. This requirement will be a full and open competition open to&nbsp;all who meets the requirements. Full details will be listed in the Requests for Proposal (RFP).</p>

Requests should reference the solicitation number, state the name of the firm, name of the requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address. The solicitation will also be posted within Fedbizopps. Requests should be mailed to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ATTN: Desiree Harris</strong></p>

If the Contracting Officer isn't available, please contact the Team Leader, Vivian S. Hubbs at Vhubbs@cdc.gov.</strong></p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct interviewing, data processing, and data file documentation for the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Interviewing shall be conducted from mid-2011 to mid-2019, based upon approximately 5,000 completed interviews per year with men and women 15-44 years of age in the household population of the United States. In summary, the contractor shall perform the following tasks, working in close, continuing collaboration with the NCHS/NSFG staff:</p>
<p>(1) design a national sample that will yield about 5,000 interviews per year with men <br />and women 15-44 years of age for up to 8 years (mid-2011 through mid-2019), a total of about 40,000 interviews), with oversamples of Hispanic men and women, Black men and women, and males and females 15-19 years of age; <br />(2) program and test questionnaires for males and females; <br />(3) prepare advance letters, consent forms, and other survey field materials; <br />(4) recruit, hire, and train interviewers;<br />(5) conduct all interviews in person, typically in respondents' homes, collecting signed consent for the interview for all respondents, and signed parental consent for interviews with 15-17 year olds;<br />(6) achieve a 75% weighted response rate for both men and women;<br />(7) Use laptop computers to conduct the interviews, and send the (encrypted) data electronically to the contractor's central office as promptly as possible; <br />(8) Prepare 3 public use data files based on every 2-3 years of interviewing <br />(a public use file must be based on at least 12,000 interviews);<br />(9) Prepare Series 1 ("Plan and Operation") and Series 2 ("Sample Design, weighting, imputation, &amp; variance estimation") reports to describe the work that was done.<br />(10) Keep the data safe, secure, and confidential.</p>
<p>Thus, this contract will require the collection of a wide range of complex and sensitive data, in person, in English and Spanish, from national samples. The data must measure trends &amp; differences among the total population &amp; important sub-groups, with a response rate that gives its users confidence in the results, and at a cost that NCHS can afford. The contractor must also meet requirements for Certification and Accreditation for IT security under FISMA and other applicable laws.</p>
<p>Further information on the survey is available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm.<br />Offerors are expected to be familiar with the contents of the web site and with Series 1, No. 48 ("Planning and Development of the continuous National Survey of Family Growth" and Series 2, No. 142 ("National Survey of Family Growth, Cycle 6: Sample Design, Weighting, Imputation, and Variance Estimation.") A Series 2 report for continuous interviewing will be released with the RFC.</p>

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain crew carrier buses as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents.  We anticipate issuing the solicitation within 15 days of the date of this notice.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services.  This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet.  Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vipr.php.In addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:  1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer.  A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php. 2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication.   Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected.  The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR).  Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system.  Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account.  The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud.   The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website:  http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Near Earth Networks Services postedon January 27, 2010. You are notified that the synopsis is revised to provideclarification of the contract extension period.  Accordingly, the following text replacesthe synopsis Description text in its entirety:NASA intends to enter into a sole-source contract extension with Honeywell TechnologySolutions, Inc. (HTSI) pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source insupport of NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center Flight Projects Directorate.  Thisprocurement is to extend the period of performance/effective ordering period of contractNNG04DA00C, Near Earth Networks Services (NENS), for a period of up to 1-year from April9, 2010 through April 8, 2011.	NASA plans to extend the contract for a base period ofsix months, beginning April 9, 2010. An option for an additional six months, startingOctober 9, 2010, may be exercised if necessary.  NASA is taking into account the pendingcorrective action on the follow-on procurement, Space Communications Networks Services(SCNS), and the planned 90 day phase in period, and is adding the option period to coverany further future delays that may occur in awarding the SCNS contract. There will be an increase in the Core and IDIQ estimated values in order to allow for thecontinuation of services, the modification of existing services, and for new work untilthe SCNS competitive follow-on contract is awarded. The contract extension and increasein Core and IDIQ values is necessary in order to ensure program continuity and criticalmission support and to avoid significant technical and programmatic impacts to NASAprograms. The scope of the existing work encompasses the following functionalrequirements: Project and Network Management, Planning, Management Reporting/Reviews,Financial Management, maintenance of and compliance with  Performance Metrics, Propertyand Logistics Management, Configuration Management and Control, Security Management,Safety and Health Management, Quality Assurance, Environmental Management, Space NetworkOperations, TDRS Flight Operations, TDRS Console Support, Scheduling/Control/Status,NCCDS Operations, Scheduling of Non-customer Activities, Service Accounting, EngineeringConfiguration Management, Documentation Maintenance, Facilities Operations, andMaintenance, Custodial Services, Facilities Configuration Management and Documentation,SN Security, SN Logistics, WSC Administrative Computing, Networking, andTelecommunications, System Engineering and Development, Engineering Studies, MissionNetworks Loading, Modeling and Analysis, Requirements Development, Testing Simulations,and Integration, Hardware and Software Development, Facilities Engineering, SustainingEngineering, Software Maintenance, Hardware Maintenance, Logistics, Ground Network SpaceCommunications Services, Satellite Laser Ranging Network Operations, NASA IntegratedServices Network Interface support, Mission Unique Equipment support, FacilitiesOperations and Maintenance, and Alternate Wide Area Network Services. HTSI as the current and in-place incumbent, has the in-depth knowledge of governmentfacilities, networks and systems, management structure and personnel to provideuninterrupted continuation of mission critical support. An interruption and restart ofthe services currently being performed with a new contractor that is unfamiliar with theexisting networks, facilities, and the specific requirements of the NENS contract, wouldjeopardize the success of space exploration goals and critical on-orbit assets as well asthe day to day operation of the ground and space networks managed by various NASAdirectorates. Due to the time and substantial duplication of costs involved in procuringand phasing in another contractor at this time, HTSI is considered the only contractorthat can meet NASAs GSFC needs given the short period of performance for the extension. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon February 11, 2010. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the Government.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to Study Opportunity Title: Developing Environmental Protocols and Monitoring to Support Ocean Renewable Energy and Stewardship is to provide changes and clarifications to the original BAA announcement, based on questions received from potential Offerors by the required response date of 20 January 2010.  This amendment is organized based on the original BAA structure.  All items are clarifications, except where specifically noted.
There are no further amendments anticipated at this time, the scope remains the same, and the response date for submission of proposals remains unchanged at 3:00 p.m. EST, 22 February 2010.  
AMENDMENT OF BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA)MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS)
Study Opportunity Title:  Developing Environmental Protocols and Monitoring to Support Ocean Renewable Energy and Stewardship
Study Opportunity Number:  M10PS00152, Amendment 1
I. TOPICS
Topic 1: Characterization & Potential Impacts of Noise Producing Construction & Operation Activities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)
For Topic 1, the anticipated award amounts will cover all three phases of development - before, during and after construction.   
The proposal should describe the Offeror's approach to the objectives as stated in the BAA for all four of the listed areas.  No specific GPS coordinates describing the areas are available at the present time.  Two of the four areas will be chosen for implementation at a later time using the status of facility planning as one criterion for the decision.  
Given the differences in the four areas, it is expected that budgets for each area may vary.  Individual budgets for each of the areas must be included in the proposal.
Within the timeframe of the BAA, we anticipate that only test facilities will be constructed, not arrays producing energy for commercial use.  The proposal would accomplish the characterization and estimate the potential impacts at test facilities.  No timeline for construction or operation phases is available at this time.
Topic 3:  Physical Oceanography Field Study to Assess Potential Environmental Impacts of Prospective Marine and Hydrokinetic Energy-Generating Devices 
The intent is to focus the effort on a smaller portion of the coastline rather than attempting to include the entire length in a single effort.  Regions are based on biophysical characteristics rather than administrative boundaries.  Proposals should address sites on the Atlantic and/or Pacific seaboards.  The Gulf of Mexico is excluded.  The particular site addressed should encompass Federal waters at least in part.  Since the assessment of impact of OCS operations conducted by MMS extends to state waters, the study site does not have to be wholly within Federal waters. However, the deployment sites at the Federal waters are strongly encouraged.
Topic 3 is focused on hydrokinetic energy generation specifically (i.e. using the motion of water to generate energy contained in ocean currents or ocean waves). However, a proposal that included wind facilities would not be excluded from consideration.
Because, wind is one of the major driving forces of the physical processes at hydrokinetic energy sites, the measurement of wind is included in this Topic to assess the potential impacts.  While a proposal that included wind would still be considered, a proposal that addressed wind alone would not.
The term analytical solution refers to the solution that will resolve the changes to flow systems (or physical processes) in the ocean environment after the installation of hydrokinetic energy generation devices.  The information derived from this effort will feed the development of an analytical solution in a future effort.
The inclusion of a modeling study to address requirements in Topic 3 would not result in the exclusion of the proposal from consideration.
Topic 4:  Evaluation of Environmental Monitoring Technologies for Offshore Renewable Energy
Proposals under Topic 4 may address technologies expected both in Federal and State waters.  All hydrokinetic and wind technologies implemented in marine waters may be included in proposals on this topic.  Proposals may include assessments focused on any or all marine and hydrokinetic and offshore wind environmental information needs.  
Proposals should evaluate the technologies used to conduct environmental monitoring, not the energy-producing technologies or equipment themselves.  
The evaluation should assess existing environmental technologies to evaluate whether they are sufficiently robust for an adequate assessment of the environments where marine hydrokinetic and offshore wind energy development is likely to occur.
The evaluation may assess existing environmental technologies, adaptations of existing systems and equipment, newly conceived technologies, and/or existing technologies not currently commercialized or not currently being applied to offshore renewable energy.
Proposals may include, as deemed appropriate by the Offeror, such elements as a discussion of system integration with motion sensing and software correction, an industry assessment, or offshore testing, however these are not requirements for this topic.  Proposals may address as many areas of environmental monitoring (e.g. physical, biological, geological) as deemed appropriate.  
Topic 5:  Sub-Seabed Geologic Carbon Dioxide Sequestration Best Management Practices
Topic 5 describes a research study effort.  
The primary users of the deliverables from proposals addressing Topic 5 will be within the US Government.  Because products will be available to the public, developers may use the results as well.
Topic 6: Renewable Energy Visual Evaluations
Details regarding the number and location of end users, deployment, servers and licensing will depend on the proposed approach.  
The following is a change to the original requirements for Topic 6.  The following paragraph replaces the second full paragraph in Topic 6.The objective of proposals under this topic is to provide the tools necessary to assess the potential visual impacts associated with offshore renewable energy technologies including wave, wind, and ocean current projects. The result shall build an interactive GIS tool into which the necessary data can be plugged to evaluate sites of choice. Proposals should define data layers and formats required as inputs to the tool. Offerors should evaluate existing tools for their applicability to this effort.  The requirement is that the technological approach to the tool that is proposed should be comparable to the functionality provided by ArcView 9.2.  Alternatives to the ArcView software package will be considered but they must be compatible with existing MMS systems or be derived from software that is commercially available off the shelf.  A plan to ensure that the tool remains useful and accessible for the foreseeable future must be included in any proposal.  User selectable/specified parameters include: The number of structures in a hypothetical facility or array, The full height of structures (including maximum rotor height for wind turbines), The distance between structures in the facility or array, Various configurations of structures within the array, The location of the onshore viewpoint, The height of the onshore viewpoint, and Other potential Offeror-defined viewshed elements.
Topic 7:  Renewable Energy Capacity Inventory in Coastal Alaska 
The BAA seeks information relevant to development prospects for renewable energy sources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) of Alaska.  This could include any and/or all renewable energy generation technologies that might be deployed in the marine environment of the OCS.
Proposals addressing renewable energy sources in State waters in addition to OCS waters will be considered.
Topic 8:  Ocean Renewable Energy Siting in the Context of Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning
Generation of new oceanographic, ecological and human information is not expected as part of proposals addressing Topic 8.  Existing data should be used and collection and integration efforts could be included in the proposal.
A specific, active application for an ocean renewable energy project is not required for proposals addressing Topic 8.  Proposals offering an integrated evaluation approach that can be used under Federal, State or regional siting programs for future ocean renewable energy project proposals will be considered. 
Details regarding end users, deployment, servers and licensing will depend on the proposed approach.  
II. AWARD INFORMATION
The following is an addition to the original requirement under item (b) of this section: The Government anticipates award of multiple year (options) and/or multi-year, cost reimbursable and/or firm fixed price contracts resulting from this BAA. 
These are clarifications.The total funding available for all awards under this BAA is approximately $6.5 M. The anticipated total award amount (for all years of the effort) for individual proposals addressing a single topic is given within each topic.  For example, the same amount is available regardless of whether the effort is proposed for one year or for five years.  All funding for the project will be provided either in full at the outset or incrementally over the first three to five years.  Proposals outside the anticipated award amounts for the individual topics and proposals addressing more than one topic will be considered.  
There is no inherent advantage or disadvantage to addressing multiple topics in a single proposal.  Multi-topic proposals must address all aspects of each topic included.
Estimated funding ranges for multi-topic proposals may be combined.  For example, if topics 1 and 2 were addressed in a single proposal, the award could be expected to range between $600,000 and $1,000,000.
The number of awards for a given topic cannot be predicted in advance.
III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION
Any organization except Federal laboratories as defined in the BAA may be the lead on a proposal.
Team efforts are required for all bids.  Members of the team must come from at least two of the three sectors listed in the BAA.  There is no limit on the number of organizations comprising the team.  A proposal from a consortium of groups would meet the requirements for consideration.
System integrators are the government personnel who will be included as needed to incorporate and make available the deliverables on government information systems.  Other contractors would consist of organizations retained by the Agencies funding the proposal that are engaged in similar activities or involved in information systems support.  The selection of other entities with whom data, software and other information will be shared will depend on the content of the particular proposal.
Note that the default policy in NOPP is the full, open and immediate disclosure of all data and products taken under NOPP sponsorship.  Waivers and exceptions to this policy should be requested in the proposal and may be granted by the cognizant Program Officer.
IV. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION
The following is an addition to the original requirement under the bulleted information in the section titled Full Proposal Format  Volume 1  Technical and Volume 2  Cost Proposal. Offerors wishing to respond to more than one topic as part of a coordinated effort should submit a single proposal addressing all topics.  In Volume 1, an additional 7 pages will be allowed for each additional topic, e.g. one topic = 15 pages, 2 topics = 22 pages, 3 topics = 29 pages, etc.  The relevant topic(s) should be identified for each task.  Volume 2 of the proposal must correlate with the tasks as proposed in Volume 1.  The budget and schedule should be broken down by topic and year.
The following is change to the original requirement under the bulleted information in the section titled Full Proposal Format  Volume 1  Technical and Volume 2  Cost Proposal. List of References: Provide source of each reference cited in the proposal. No specific format required. (This item is NOT included in page count.)
These are clarifications.A particular agency does not need to be identified in a proposal because it will be reviewed by any and all interested NOPP partner agencies.
Partial awards of single and multiple topic proposals may be considered.
Offerors may focus their proposals in whatever manner is deemed appropriate.  Proposals may include any approach to the topic deemed to be the best way to address the requirements.
If there is a cost associated with the use of UNOLS vessels, it needs to be clearly specified in the cost volume of the proposal and included in the total cost of the offerors approach.  In addition, a copy of the ship request form must also be included with the proposal.

<p>The National Cancer Institute is expanding funding of basic and translational research programs that rely heavily on the sufficient availability of high quality biospecimens and associated data suitable for use in its research programs.</p>
<p>The Cancer Human Biobank (caHUB, http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/cahub/) is a targeted effort to establish a centralized, world class cancer tissue resource, Pathology Resource Center, and associated infrastructure. caHUB has a mission to accelerate biomedical and translational cancer research by ensuring the adequate and continuous supply of high-quality, highly annotated human biospecimens. caHUB will create a collection of diseased and normal biospecimens to support a broad range of scientific needs. caHUB will support collaborative research combining the power of multiple analytical platforms and technologies across the same set of highly qualified and characterized biospecimens. With caHUB and the research and development that caHUB will support, the NCI's overarching goal is to improve the ability to diagnose, prognosticate, treat, develop new and novel therapeutics, and prevent cancer.</p>
<p>Normal human tissues are essential to the study of cancer and other diseases. The National Institutes of Health's Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, a NIH Roadmap initiative (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/), aims to provide a resource to the scientific community with which to study the relationship between genetic variation and regulation of gene expression. This project will analyze multiple human tissues from donors who will also be characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping. caHUB will acquire normal tissues for the GTEx project through contracts with organizations such as rapid autopsy programs, organ and tissue transplant programs, surgical tissue procurement programs, and medical examiner programs.</p>
<p>This Request for Proposal (RFP) is to solicit technical capabilities responses from entities that have the ability to serve as a Tissue Source Site (TSS), providing clinically annotated normal human biospecimens to caHUB and GTEx.</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>To meet caHUB and GTEx project goals, SAIC-F will award one or more Basic Ordering Agreements to organizations capable of accruing and delivering targeted normal biospecimens and their associated clinical data. The biospecimens and data will be delivered to caHUB for quality control, extensive pathology characterization, diagnostic verification, processing into molecular analytes, storage, other relevant processes, and distribution for qualified research and development.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that organizations providing technical capabilities proposals in response to this solicitation may include, among others:<br /><br />&bull; Dedicated Rapid Autopsy Programs<br />&bull; Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs)<br />&bull; Tissue Recovery Organizations (TROs)<br />&bull; Medical Examiners<br />&bull; Surgical Tissue Procurement Programs</p>

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION:<br />a. General: This proposed contract is for Architect-Engineer (A-E) Construction phase Services (CPS) which will be procured in accordance with PL-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and implemented in FAR Part 36.6. <br /><br />The proposed A-E contract will support the construction of an approximately $1B Hospital located at Ft Hood, Texas and could include CPS for various military and some Civil Works projects which are generally within, but not limited to the Southwestern Division (SWD) regional boundaries (TX, LA, NM, AR, OK) to allow the flexibility of sharing capacity with other Corps Districts (outside SWD boundaries) and other Federal agencies in unique cases. This flexibility would only be exercised in unique cases (anticipate less than 10%). North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711.<br /><br />This announcement is open only to SMALL BUSINESSES. The prime A-E firm must perform 50% or more of the work on this contract. Anticipated contract award will be on or about May 2010. One Indefinite Delivery Contract(IDC) contract will be awarded from this announcement for a cumulative amount of $20,000,000 with a minimum guarantee amount of $5,000.00 only for the base period of 2 years with 3 year options and for a term not to exceed five years. <br /><br />Only Architect or Engineering firms may compete for this contract per FAR 36.601-4(b).<br /><br />Price will not be used as a criterion for selection. There will be NO design services included in this contract.<br /><br />Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest. The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors.<br /><br />b. Nature of Work: The services necessary for each requirement will be negotiated and awarded as individual task orders. The Architect-Engineer (A-E) shall furnish all personnel, services, materials, supplies and supervision required to fully complete each task order. Personnel provided by this contract will operate out of Government supplied facilities.<br /><br />c. Contract Award Procedure: <br />The proposed services will be obtained by Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov .<br /><br />2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Construction phase services are required to support construction activities and may include tasks supporting projects not yet in construction. Projects are anticipated to be primarily in support of Fort Worth District/Southwestern Division U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at Ft Hood, Texas. However, Task Orders under resultant IDC contract may on a limited basis be awarded by SWF for use in other Corps of Engineer Districts, other DOD or other Federal agencies for projects anywhere in the US or its territories. Required services include a broad range of engineering and construction activities including (but not limited to) assistance and guidance to field offices, project management, construction QA inspection and reporting, review of contract documents and shop drawings, review of NAS schedules and QC plans, and investigation and reporting of construction contractor claims.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	When will this presolicitation become a solicitation?This presolicitation will only become a solicitation issued to the highest rated firm at the end of the FAR 36.6 Architect and Engineering, and Brooks Act procedures.  This current presolicitation is only asking for Standard Form 330 Statement of Qualifications from interested firms.  2.	Is it required that an Architect firm prime this, or may an alternate firm prime it as long as they do business under NAICS 541330?A firm under NAICS code 541330 can be the prime for this as long as they meet all of the criteria listed in the presolicitation, and have an architect on the team.3.	Do you by chance have an estimate of how many contracts the NEBC plans to issue under this IDIQ?The NEBC will award one IDIQ off of this presolicitation, and reserves the right to issue multiple awards.  The NEBC does not have a set number of projects in mind to issue off of the awarded IDIQ?  That amount is open over the base and options years of the IDIQ, and the dollar amount of $7.5 million.4.	We are reviewing the presolicitation are wondering if the Response Date was still February 15, 2010, as it is a Federal Holiday.The date has been changed to February 16, 2010, and the last day for Technical Questions has been changed to February 9.  These changes were posted on FBO on January 27, 2010.5.	Will our partner's SDVOSB status help meet potential set-asides should you elect to set-aside this work to SDVOSB firms?The SDVOSB status will not help as a sub.6.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  7.	Do all the consultants on a team need to be within 100 miles of a VISN listed hospital?  Additionally, do all of the consultants need to be within 100miles of the same hospital?  The prime firm needs to have either their main office or a branch office within 100 miles of one of the medical facilities listed on the presolicitation.  The consultants do not have to be within 100 miles of the same hospital.  8.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.  If you are interested in three VISN's then I would want to see three separate SF330's.  I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.9.	So that we can identify the distance of our office locations relative to your facilities, are VISN maps in vector file format (i.e., Illustrator, either AI or EPS file) available that show the location of your facilities?This link will provide a map and links to each VISN for the specific locations: http://www1.va.gov/caresdecision/page.cfm?pg=31.10.	In the text it mentions the Small Business Size Standard is $4.50 million gross annual revenue but on the side it says no set aside. Do we need to be a small business to submit?The posting does mention the Small Business Size Standard, and also mentions that if enough qualifications are received the government reserves the right to make this a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-Aside.  Again that is only if enough qualified firms submit.  We encourage all types of firms to submit for this AE IDIQ.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	The solicitation for the VISN 16 AE IDIQ clearly states that "A/E firms must be located within a 100 mile radius of at least one of the facilities in VISN 16"  Do ALL member firms of the A/E team submitted for this contract need to fall within this restriction?  Or is it only the Lead (prime) A/E firm that needs to fall within this radius?Only the prime firm must be within a 100 mile radius of one of the facilities in VISN 16.  2.	In the text it mentions the Small Business Size Standard is $4.50 million gross annual revenue but on the side it says no set aside. Do we need to be a small business to submit?The posting does mention the Small Business Size Standard, and also mentions that if enough qualifications are received the government reserves the right to make this a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-Aside.  Again that is only if enough qualified firms submit.  We encourage all types of firms to submit for this AE IDIQ.  3.	My question is whether the VA prefers that these proposals be led by an Architect or whether we as engineers can prime? The NAICS code listed in FBO was 541310 which is for Architectural Services, but an Engineering Firm under NAICS Code 541330 can also submit as the prime firm, as long as there is an architect on the team and the criteria listed in the presolicitation is followed.  4.	We are reviewing the presolicitation are wondering if the Response Date was still February 15, 2010, as it is a Federal Holiday.The date has been changed to February 16, 2010, and the last day for Technical Questions has been changed to February 9.  These changes were posted on FBO on January 27, 2010.5.	Will our partner's SDVOSB status help meet potential set-asides should you elect to set-aside this work to SDVOSB firms?The SDVOSB status will not help as a sub.6.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  7.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.  If you are interested in three VISN's then I would want to see three separate SF330's.  I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.8.	So that we can identify the distance of our office locations relative to your facilities, are VISN maps in vector file format (i.e., Illustrator, either AI or EPS file) available that show the location of your facilities?This link will provide a map and links to each VISN for the specific locations: http://www1.va.gov/caresdecision/page.cfm?pg=31.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	The maximum award contract of $7.5 M, is that construction cost or is that design fees?The maximum award of $7.5 Million is for the AE IDIQ Contract inclusive of the base and all option years.  This is not a construction cost.  This would cover any of the design task orders that are issued over the period of the contract. 2.	Although the NAICS Code is for Architecture,  most of the work anticipated is energy related and there by primarily engineering.  Will Engineering Primes be acceptable?Engineering firms are acceptable as primes under 541330 NAICS code, and as long as there is an architect on the team. 3.	Will our partner's SDVOSB status help meet potential set-asides should you elect to set-aside this work to SDVOSB firms?The SDVOSB status will not help as a sub.4.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  5.	Do all the consultants on a team need to be within 100 miles of a VISN listed hospital?  Additionally, do all of the consultants need to be within 100miles of the same hospital?  The prime firm needs to have either their main office or a branch office within 100 miles of one of the medical facilities listed on the presolicitation.  The consultants do not have to be within 100 miles of the same hospital.  6.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.  If you are interested in three VISN's then I would want to see three separate SF330's.  I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.7.

Can you please tell me if the above referenced RFQ is a small business set aside?The presolicitation that you referenced is not a small business set-aside.  However, if there are enough qualified Service Disabled or Veteran Owned firms that submit their SF330's then the Government reserves the right to make this an SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside.  9.	We are reviewing the presolicitation are wondering if the Response Date was still February 15, 2010, as it is a Federal Holiday.The date has been changed to February 16, 2010, and the last day for Technical Questions has been changed to February 9.  These changes were posted on FBO on January 27, 2010.

Can you send me the RFP for submittal to your organization.This is not an RFP, but a request for your firm to submit Standard Form 330 statement of qualifications.  This is not a solicitation.  Please follow FAR 36.6 Architect and Engineering, to better understand how we are following AE and Brooks Act procedures for this procurement.  4.	Can you please tell me if the above referenced RFQ is a small business set aside?The presolicitation that you referenced is not a small business set-aside.

The presolicitation posted is asking for firms to submit their Standard Form (SF) 330 statement of qualifications.3.	Is the VA looking for an engineering firm to prime this contract, or an architect?  ( Most of the design work appears to be engineering)The NAICS Code listed on FBO is 541310 for Architectural Services, but an Engineering firm under NAICS Code 541330 can submit as a prime.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	Are you anticipating an architectural or engineering lead for the project; typically architecture firms bring more project management experience to a project, but these kind of retrofits are often led by a mechanical engineer; please clarify if possible.The NAICS code listed was for an Architectural firm, but an Engineering firm under the 541330 NAICS Code can submit as lead.  We are looking for teams to meet the criteria listed in the presolicitation.2.	Do you have an example project that might guide us in our thinking about how best to respond to this solicitation?I do not have any example projects that I will provide, but I recommend reviewing previous postings on FBO from the VA NEBC.   3.	Regarding the Management Plan, are you looking for a relatively generic response in terms of how we manage projects from concept through construction given that this scope of work and number of projects are not known at this time?Yes, a generic response is appropriate, as well as if you can incorporate what you may have done with previous energy related projects in this category.4.	Should we submit separate responses for each region in which we have an office within a 100 mile radius, or could we submit one response on behalf of all regions in which we have offices?A separate response should be submitted for each VISN that your firm is interested in and is within the 100 mile radius.5.	I assume from the solicitation the goal of this project is to reduce energy consumption within VA facilities significantly; have you done energy assessments of your existing facilities and therefore have current energy consumption figures; do you also have a goal in mind for energy reduction?I do not have any figures or examples to provide.  I also do not have a goal in mind, other than what the VA Energy Policy and Regulations state.6.	Or, is part of the scope of work to provide energy assessments and then design for the retrofits and provide bid documentation to contractors?This AE IDIQ involves many different types of energy projects and a majority of those are listed in the presolicitation.  7.	Do the facilities under this contract include offices and cemeteries and other VA facilities in addition to healthcare facilities?There is the possibility that this contract could include work at any of the sites within the VISN.  The majority of the energy projects more than likely would be at the medical centers, but it would be best to be prepared for anything.8.	When can we anticipate our questions will be answered with the response due on 2/15?All of the questions will be answered before the SF330 response date of 2/16.  The cut-off date for questions is 2/9, so all the questions should be answered a few days after that.  This was posted on FBO on 1/27/2010.9.	Could you please clarify what "Full and Open competition" means in the following sentence for this presolicitation?  Full and open competition will be utilized. The NAICS Code is 541310, Architectural Services, and the Small Business Size Standard is $4.50 million gross annual revenue.Full and Open competition means any type of firm can submit their SF330 statement of qualifications.  I included the NAICS Code and small business size standards so firms would be familiar what that was, and to provide this for any SDVOSB and VOSB firms responding to this part of the presolicitation:"If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to set aside this procurement for SDVOSB or VOSB, or conduct discussions with the highest qualified SDVOSB or VOSB firms."The above paragraph does not restrict the competition, as it is still full and open and all firms are encouraged to submit.10.	I have a question about eligibility. It is regarding the following statement from the solicitation."If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to do a SDVOSB set-aside, or only negotiate with the highest qualified SDVOSB firms."We are a "Small Business" without any veteran service disabled or ownership status. Are we eligible to apply for this IDIQ program?  Is this solicitation limited to (VOSB) or (SDVOSB) firms?All firms are eligible to submit their qualifications for this and this is not limited to just SDVOSB or VOSB.  The line you from the presolicitation you mentioned is only applicable if the Government feels this is necessary.  Your firm is eligible to submit.11.	Would you please tell me whether you are looking for teams of architects and their consultants or independent proposals from engineering firms such as ours? Interested firms need to have teams or in-house capabilities to provide and meet all of the criteria that is listed in the presolicitation.  How you achieve this is entirely up to you.12.	Will our partner's SDVOSB status help meet potential set-asides should you elect to set-aside this work to SDVOSB firms?The SDVOSB status will not help as a sub.13.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  14.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.  If you are interested in three VISN's then I would want to see three separate SF330's.  I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.15.	So that we can identify the distance of our office locations relative to your facilities, are VISN maps in vector file format (i.e., Illustrator, either AI or EPS file) available that show the location of your facilities?This link will provide a map and links to each VISN for the specific locations: http://www1.va.gov/caresdecision/page.cfm?pg=31.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	Would this presolicitation be open to an engineering firm as prime or should it be lead by an architectural firm?The NAICS code listed in FBO was 541310 which is for Architectural Services, but an Engineering Firm under NAICS Code 541330 can also submit as the prime firm, as long as there is an architect on the team and the criteria listed in the presolicitation is followed.  2.	Have you previously awarded this type of A/E contract in the past?The NEBC has not previously awarded an AE IDIQ contract.3.	The notice is called a "presolicitation" but gives a response date of February 15. What is the difference between a presolicitation and solicitation? Did this maybe start as a presolicitation to generate interest?This presolicitation is asking for SF330's from interested vendors.  This is a different presolicitation for the Architect and Engineering Procedures process.  There will not be a solicitation issued until the end of the FAR 36.6 A/E process, which is after evaluations and interviews, and the solicitation will only be issued to the highest ranked firm.4.	The solicitation states that full and open competition will be utilized. But then it states  that the NAICS Code is 541310, Architectural Services, and the Small Business Size Standard is $4.50 million gross annual revenue. Is there a set-aside for small businesses after all?This procurement is full and open with the Government's option to set this aside for SDVOSB or VOSB firms if there are enough qualified firms that submit under those statuses.  All types of firms are encouraged to submit for this procurement.  The Small Business Standards are listed only to determine what would be considered Small Business Status for the possibility of the SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside.5.	Is the VA looking for an architectural firm to lead this effort with the support of the named sub consultants, or can each discipline mentioned submit its own SF-330 to you?The VA is looking for an Architectural or Engineering firm to lead a team of subs that meet the criteria listed in the presolicitation.  We do not want a separate SF330 for each discipline; just include that on the SF330 that your firm submits.6.	We are reviewing the presolicitation are wondering if the Response Date was still February 15, 2010, as it is a Federal Holiday.The date has been changed to February 16, 2010, and the last day for Technical Questions has been changed to February 9.  These changes were posted on FBO on January 27, 2010.7.	Will our partner's SDVOSB status help meet potential set-asides should you elect to set-aside this work to SDVOSB firms?The SDVOSB status will not help as a sub.8.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  9.	Do all the consultants on a team need to be within 100 miles of a VISN listed hospital?  Additionally, do all of the consultants need to be within 100miles of the same hospital?  The prime firm needs to have either their main office or a branch office within 100 miles of one of the medical facilities listed on the presolicitation.  The consultants do not have to be within 100 miles of the same hospital.  10.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.  If you are interested in three VISN's then I would want to see three separate SF330's.  I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.11.	So that we can identify the distance of our office locations relative to your facilities, are VISN maps in vector file format (i.e., Illustrator, either AI or EPS file) available that show the location of your facilities?This link will provide a map and links to each VISN for the specific locations: http://www1.va.gov/caresdecision/page.cfm?pg=31.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	On previous VA solicitations there are typically small disadvantaged business goals (i.e., for HUBZone, 8(a), SDVOSB, etc.). Other than a preference for SDVOSB prime bidders, will there be any HUBZone participation goals for this and the other VISN contracts?As you noted this presolicitation allows the government to have the right to set-aside or only have discussions with SDVOSB or VOSB firms if there are enough qualified that have submitted SF330's.  There are currently no additional preferences for HUBZone firms. 2.	Also, I presume the 100-mile distance requirement pertains only to prime contractors and not subs.The 100-mile radius is for prime firms only, not the subs.3.	My question is whether the VA prefers that these proposals be led by an Architect or whether we as engineers can prime? The NAICS code listed in FBO was 541310 which is for Architectural Services, but an Engineering Firm under NAICS Code 541330 can also submit as the prime firm, as long as there is an architect on the team and the criteria listed in the presolicitation is followed.  4.	I have a question in regards to the above mentioned RFQ.  Can we have multiple consultants listed in this RFQ for each discipline?  For instance can we add multiple structural engineers, civil, electrical, etc. or do we need to only have one consultant for each discipline?Yes, you can submit multiple subs for the same discipline.  It is your choice how you want to create your team, as long as it meets the criteria listed in the presolicitation.5.	Can you please tell me if the above referenced RFQ is a small business set aside?The presolicitation that you referenced is not a small business set-aside.  However, if there are enough qualified Service Disabled or Veteran Owned firms that submit their SF330's then the Government reserves the right to make this an SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside.  6.	We are reviewing the presolicitation are wondering if the Response Date was still February 15, 2010, as it is a Federal Holiday.The date has been changed to February 16, 2010, and the last day for Technical Questions has been changed to February 9.  These changes were posted on FBO on January 27, 2010.7.	Will our partner's SDVOSB status help meet potential set-asides should you elect to set-aside this work to SDVOSB firms?The SDVOSB status will not help as a sub.8.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  9.	Do all the consultants on a team need to be within 100 miles of a VISN listed hospital?  Additionally, do all of the consultants need to be within 100miles of the same hospital?  The prime firm needs to have either their main office or a branch office within 100 miles of one of the medical facilities listed on the presolicitation.  The consultants do not have to be within 100 miles of the same hospital.  10.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.  If you are interested in three VISN's then I would want to see three separate SF330's.  I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.11.	So that we can identify the distance of our office locations relative to your facilities, are VISN maps in vector file format (i.e., Illustrator, either AI or EPS file) available that show the location of your facilities?This link will provide a map and links to each VISN for the specific locations: http://www1.va.gov/caresdecision/page.cfm?pg=31.

<a href="mailto:donald.marsh2@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	Can you please tell me if there is an incumbent contractor for this opportunity and the name of that company?The NEBC currently does not have its own AE IDIQ contract for VISN 23. 2.	In two (2) locations of the IDIQ the requirement for a business having a specific NAICS code is referenced.  In one location it is listed as NAICS Code: 541 - Professional, Scientific and Technical Services/541310 - - Architectural Services.  In the other location just NAICS Code is 541310, Architectural Services is listed.  Does this mean that only a truly Architectural Company falling under 541310 can submit?  Or can any type of company falling under NAICS code 541 be eligible as the lead firm.A firm under the 541310 or 541330 is eligible as the lead firms.  There are a number of 541 type firms, but we are looking for architectural and engineering based firms.3.	Regarding the requirement for a Small Business Size Standard of $4.50 million gross annual revenue, does this mean only the lead firm has to fall under this requirement or all discipline sub-consultants as well?The small business size standard only applies to interested SDVOSB and VOSB firms.4.	Does the team need to have licensed professionals in all of the states (IA, ND, MN, NE, SD, OH?) to submit or just for the state for the facilities they are within a 100 mile radius?  Basically, does the team need to be on-call for all or all of the projects?If you are licensed in at least one of the states listed, you will be able to stamp drawings at any Federal Facility in the states listed for VISN 23.5.	I noticed under the location & county section there are a few facilities located in Ohio.  However, under the pre-solicitation notice section the listed VISN 23 facilities don't include Ohio.  Can you please clarify if Ohio facilities will be part of the IDIQ?Ohio is the location of the National Energy Business Center (NEBC), and is not part of the facilities for VISN 23.  It is on here as the office that issued the presolicitation.6.	Can the lead team have one office and depend on their team sub-consultants to have an office within the 100 mile radius of the other locations?The prime has to have an office located within 100 miles of one of the listed facilities.  The subs do not carry this requirement.7.	If any of the specific facility projects require more than any one consultant/sub-consultant carries, will the lead firm need to carry the increased insurance and/or each individual sub-consultant?We contract with the lead firm, not the subs as they are responsibility of the prime firm.8.	If we submit directly on this solicitation as prime, can we submit only for the disciplines we directly engage in (Mechanical, Electrical, and Energy) or do we need to list additional team members in all the other disciplines noted (i.e. Structural, Civil, Landscape etc.)  Your firm is free to prepare a team that best covers all of the disciplines that are listed on the presolicitation.  However you do this is entirely up to you.  There is not a limit as it is strictly up to you to decide what best meets the criteria we have included in the presolicitation. 9.	The RFP indicates Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Minnesota.  I just want to clarify -do we as a company need to be licensed in all the states listed?Our company is only licensed in Iowa and Nebraska -can we still submit for this project?The fact that your firm is licensed in Nebraska and Iowa is fine; as once you are licensed you can stamp drawings for Federal Facilities in any of the states that were mentioned in the presolicitation.  The firms just have to have licenses.10.	Can a firm submit as a prime and also be included as a team member under a different firm's submittal?The answer to your question is yes.  You can create your own team and also be a part of another firm's team.11.	Can a firm with NAICS Code 541330 submit for this project and receive equal consideration?A firm with the 541330 NAICS code can submit and will receive equal consideration, as long as there is an architect on the team as stated in the criteria listed in the presolicitation. 12.	Is this a small business Set Aside?This is not a small business set-aside, although the government reserves the right to set-aside to SDVOSB or VOSB firms if there are enough acceptable qualifications submitted. 13.	We are reviewing the presolicitation are wondering if the Response Date was still February 15, 2010, as it is a Federal Holiday.The date has been changed to February 16, 2010, and the last day for Technical Questions has been changed to February 9.  These changes were posted on FBO on January 27, 2010.14.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  15.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.  If you are interested in three VISN's then I would want to see three separate SF330's.  I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.16.	So that we can identify the distance of our office locations relative to your facilities, are VISN maps in vector file format (i.e., Illustrator, either AI or EPS file) available that show the location of your facilities?This link will provide a map and links to each VISN for the specific locations: http://www1.va.gov/caresdecision/page.cfm?pg=31.17.	For the VISN 23 solicitation, please confirm if the subject line of the email should be "VISN 23 A/E Services # VA-776-10-RP-0135" rather than "VISN 23 A/E Services # VA-776-10-RP-0134".  The subject line in the VISN 22 A/E has the same number (-0134) as the one currently for VISN 23.The (-0134) was a typo and is the solicitation number for VISN 22.  The VISN 23 AE solicitation number is VA-776-10-RP-0135.18.	Could you tell me what the insurance requirements are for this IDIQ?The insurance requirements for this presolicitation are to show a record of significant claims against your  firm because of improper or incomplete A and E services.  Also list the type and amount of liability insurance your firm carries.19.	You list several disciplines that may be required under this contract.  My question is are you expecting a specific consultant as well as individual team members for each of the listed disciplines?  Our initial thought was to identify the key disciplines such as architectural, mechanical and electrical, structural.and then acknowledge that if required we'd be able to assemble the necessary disciplines required for any particular engagement.   Would this be a typical response, or are you expecting identification of all potential consulting firms and participating team members?It is up to you how you organize your team, but we would like to see all the firms that make up your team listed.20.	Under the discipline of Historic Preservation there are firms that specialize in the procedural and administrative side of historic preservation and others that specialize in the physical design on historic structures.  Are you looking for a specific expertise here?We are just looking for a general expertise here.  We have a broad range of disciplines included.

<DESC>VA118-10-RI-0096_4Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER):Performance Evaluation Plan ExecutionThe purpose of this modification (4) to Sources Sought Notice VA118-10-RI-0096 is to provide answers to the following question(s):1)	The Notice indicates that "VLER Health Communities (VHCs) will be evaluated with respect to cost and quality outcomes, following a Performance Evaluation Plan that is currently under development. The evaluation plan will be provided to the contractor."  Will the specific criteria to be evaluated be included in that plan, or is VA seeking support for criteria development?Specific criteria will be included, however suggestions for improvements and alterations will be considered.2)	With reference to the development of the Performance Evaluation Plan under development, is VA obtaining contractor support for this activity.  Are companies who are providing such support eligible to provide the services addressed by this Sources Sought Notice?  If so, please provide the names of these companies.Any restriction(s) will be provided during the solicitation phase.3)	Are companies who previously provided other forms of support for VLER eligible to provide the services addressed by this Sources Sought Notice? If so, please provide the names of these companies.Any restriction(s) will be provided during the solicitation phase.4)	Will the contract be Small Business or Small (Service) Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SB/SDVO) or full and open?The results of the Sources Sought notice will dictate the method of procurement.5)	Can you elaborate on the steps of milestones (even in broad terms) for the VLER Health Community (VHC) pilot projects?We will select additional pilot sites in 2010, this contract will fund the development and execution of performance evaluation in those pilot sites.6)	Can you provide additional details on the VLER Health Community (VHC) selection timeframe?Not at this time.7)	Can you define VLER Health Community?VLER Health Community is a site selected by VA and DoD to initiate a pilot exchange with a local health information exchange community.8)	Can you provide examples of the health data exchanged?Initially, the data exchanged will be demographic, vitals, lab results, immunizations, medications and allergies.9)	What is the projected completion date for the Performance Evaluation Plan?April 20, 2010.10)	Can you clarify "access to patients' summary of care records"?

What is the anticipated solicitation (RFW) release date?It is funded, undetermined solicitation date.12)	To determine the best qualifications to submit for this sources sought, can the VA provide and overarching strategy or specific metrics that will be evaluated? For example, to measure cost and quality outcomes, there are a variety of metrics one could envision from measure of direct patient care (doctor and nurse performance, expertise and facilities) to patient outcomes (repeat visits, overall healthcare utilization, post-visit patient surveys, etc.) to system to system data sharing capabilities and expertise to ensure interoperability. Evaluations of each step, if not in aggregate, could result in possible differences in cost and quality.Agreed.  This list of variables will be available in the final Performance Evaluation Plan.13)	Are preliminary measures and types of evaluations methodologies established or anticipated for the Performance Evaluation Plan, and, if so, can those be provide to ensure a proper sources sought response?They are anticipated in the Performance Evaluation Plan.

What are the primary areas where comparisons will be made?Not comparative, looking for overall value of health information exchange.  However variations in the type of relationship/business model might present an opportunity for analysis.29)	Has DoD and/or VA already determined what the priorities are for this evaluation in terms of community sharing functionality?Unclear.30)	Will the evaluation be based primarily on statistical/quantitative metrics or qualitative assessments made during the course of the evaluation effort?Some qualitative measures might be indicated, but it will be primarily a quantitative evaluation.31)	Have appropriate cost models for communities already been established? Alternatively, will this methodology be provided by the contractor?Unclear.32)	How will the results of this evaluation be published? How will data integration between DoD systems and VA systems be streamlined to effect the evaluation?All results from this study are property of the Federal Government.  Contractor permission to publish must be requested.  Results of the evaluation will be published to appropriate government agencies and sources.33)	What parts of the provider workflow will need to be assessed as part of the evaluation?It is likely that an understanding of provider workflow and assessment of local variation in workflow will need to be considered in this project.  34)	Does the performance evaluation plan draft address As-Is provider workflow and define the quality of care outcomes expected? Will a To-Be provider workflow be defined?The Performance Evaluation Plan will define the as-is workflow from which assumptions are based.  Variations of workflow will need to be accounted for in the analyses.35)	Which DoD entities will be involved as stakeholders or information providers for this evaluation?Not applicable.36)	Which VA entities will be involved as stakeholders or information providers for this evaluation?Not applicable.37)	Will the contractor have access to all NHIN contractor program deliverables as well as in-process NHIN working papers?Unclear, contractor will be provided all relevant and required materials necessary to complete the project.38)	What data access restrictions will be required of the contractor?

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0002: AS OF 2/1/2010COST OF CONSTRUCTION IS BETWEEN $2 MILLION AND $5 MILLION. TIME OF SUBMISSION OF SF 330 HAS CHANGED. THE NEW DUE DATE FOR  THE SF 330 IS 2/5/2010 at 10AM. INTERVIEWS WILL BE CONDUCTED ON OR ABOUT 2/15/2010.CONTRACTING OFFICER IS SABRINA BRINKMAN, 585-297-1483. ESTIMATED SIZE OF BUILDING IS 8500 SQFT.KITCHEN IS A RESIDENTIAL KITCHEN. VA intends to award an Architech/Engineer contract for complete design services (design, construction documents, estimates of probable costs, and construction period services as defined in the SOW) for the construction of a new building to house the Women's Mental Health Program at the VA Western NY Healthcare System (VAWNYHS), 222 Richmond Avenue, Batavia, NY 14020. The consultant shall develop, by consultation and discussion with VA staff, the design and construction documents for the construction of a new Women's Rehabilitation Program Building. Work is to include the design and construction documents for architechural, interiors, mechanical, plumbing, fire protection, electrical, telecommunications, and other systems and features as necessary to construct the new building. The design of the building shall include, but not limited to, the following components:Consultant shall design the new Women's Mental Health facility to house twelve (12) private resident rooms, staff and administrative support spaces, offices, lobby, kitchen, dining, group bath/shower rooms, group session rooms, exam room, nurse's stations, conference room, lounge/living rooms, recreation room and building service spaces. Consultant shall prepare schedule of all building services, utilities, equipment, and furniture required for new building including heating, ventilating, and air conditioning equipment, ductwork, devices, and controls, plumbing supply, waste, vent piping, and fixtures and trim; fire protection system, normal and emergency power, lighting, telecommunications, voice/data, and signal systems.Consultant will check building codes and obtain drawings of existing conditions.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION. For Informational Purposes Only.  This action issued Work Authorization RA-10-01 under Management & Operating (M&O) Contract number DE-AC52-06NA25946 which is funded by American Recovery and Rehabilitation Act (ARRA) dollars. This modification provides ARRA funding in the amount of $4,700,000 to support Waste Management activities at the Nevada Test Site.  The M&O Contractor DUNS number is 195194779.  The ARRA objectives for the Waste Management effort on the Nevada Test Site (NTS) is to support the capability to safely and compliantly receive and dispose 2M ft3 of Low-Level Waste (LLW) and Mixed LLW at the Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Site at the Nevada Test Site in support of the U.S. Department of Energy Complex in Fiscal Year 2010.

NOTE:  This action is awarded under Modification no. M077.  This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars.

Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Contract for WA* (added to description in FedBizOpps):

Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award: Contract Clause DEAR 970.5243.1, Changes (DEC 2000), of the contract authorizes the Contracting Officer to make changes within the general scope of the M&O contract.  The work scope being accomplished under the Work Authorization as a result of the receipt of the ARRA funds is within the scope of the contract.  The prospects for performing the ARRA scope of work under a firm fixed-price (FFP) contract were evaluated prior issuance of the modification. The work contemplated is highly complex and many variables exist that do not lend themselves to the use of a fixed-price contract (FAR16.601(c)).  The National Nuclear Security Administration/Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO) has communicated to the M&O contractor that FFP subcontracts shall be utilized to the maximum extent possible in accomplishing the specific tasks executed with ARRA funds.

Place of Contract Performance:
•	NNSA Complex in Clark County, Nevada
•	Nevada Test site located in Nye County, Nevada.

Site Office Contracting Point of Contact(s):

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT - THE NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER (GRC) HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED UNDER THEAMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 TO ISSUE A TASK ORDER FOR PROFESSIONAL,ADMINISTRATIVE, COMPUTATIONAL, AND ENGINEERING SERVICES UNDER THE PREVIOUSLY AWARDED,COMPETITIVE, 8(A) CONTRACT NNC08BA09B WITH DB CONSULTING GROUP. **THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.** Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) represent new vehicle and operational concepts in civilaviation.  These new concepts are evolving as the nation moves toward the Next GenerationAir Transportation System (NextGen), which is under the leadership of the Joint Planningand Development Office (JPDO).	The desire and ability to fly UAS in the National AirSpace (NAS) in the near term has increased dramatically.  Although unmanned aircraft have the ability to support a number of dull, dirty anddangerous missions required by the nations science community (NASA, NOAA), emergencymanagement (FEMA, DOA) and national security and defense organizations (DHS, DOD),existing federal air regulations, procedures and technologies do not allow routine UASaccess to the NAS. The current process of requesting a Certificate of Waiver ofAuthorization (COA) to operate a UAS in the national airspace today is extremely resourceintensive and lengthy.	These COAs are restrictive and often lack the flexibility to meetthe full mission needs.  The UAS project provides NASA support to this multi-agencyobjective of enabling safe, routine access for unmanned aircraft systems in the nationalairspace.Over the course of the next 11 months, the UAS Project will focus on supporting amulti-agency effort to develop and implement a national plan to successful address thechallenges of UAS access to the NAS (National Air Space) in a safe and timely manner.  Inorder to support this activity, the UAS Project will develop two Concept of Operations(ConOps) documents.  From these documents, overall Research and Development (R&D) needswill be identified.NASA/GRC issued a task order under existing contract NNC08BA09B to develop documentationon research and development requirements that will guide how future unmanned aircraftsystems (UAS) can safely operate in the national airspace.  Specifically, the research for this task focuses on future voice and data communicationsystem concepts and operational profiles to enable unmanned aircraft systems to safelycommunicate with ground controllers.  The result of this task is the dentification offuture-state communication system functional and operational requirements for safeoperation of Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) in the national airspace.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".A T&M order is appropriate for this procurement because the uncertain nature of theresearch/testing support activities required cannot be estimated to the level of accuracynecessary to allow the use of a fixed-priced contractual vehicle. This announcement will not result in a Request for Proposal; this announcement is forinformational purposes only. All questions and/or concerns must be submitted in writingto points of contact contained herein.

<DESC>SBIR/STTR Program - The proposed innovation utilizes carbon nanotubes (CNTs) coatedwith pseudo-capacitive MnO2 material as nano-composite electrode and ionic electrolytefor the construction of ultracapacitors. This novel approach of using nano-structuredCNTs architectures provides high surface area of attachment of MnO2 nano-particles tomaximize the charge efficiency and power capacity and to reduce series resistance.Preliminary results at Vanderbilt University using this CNTs/ MnO2 nano-composite aselectrode of an ultracapacitor has demonstrated enhanced capacitor behavior of &gt;400Xover pristine CNTs as electrode.&lt;P&gt;During Phase I, we will demonstrate in the laboratory that the proposed novel concept isfeasible and measure the power and energy generation capacity, efficiency, andcharging/discharging cycle durability. The key factor to successful exploitation of theCNT/ MnO2 nano-structured composite for ultracapacitor applications is closely related tofurther understanding and control of the physics, materials, and micro-fabricationtechnology. The proposed Phase I work provides a systematic, logical, and coherentinvestigation of the material issue, device fabrication, characterization, simulation,evaluation, and optimization to meet high power requirements.

<AWARDEE>Creare Inc 16 Great Hollow Rd Hanover NH 03755-3116
<DESC>SBIR/STTR Program - Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) are critical for futureflagship exploration missions in space and on planetary surfaces. Small improvements inthe RPS performance, weight, size, and/or reliability can have a dramatic effect on thescientific capability of the vehicle and the overall mission costs. RadioisotopeThermophotovoltaic (RTPV) energy converters are a particular type of RPS that directlyconverts the heat produced by a General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) to electrical powerusing a specialized Photovoltaic (PV) cell. A key element in an RTPV system is the powerconversion electronics system that efficiently converts the low-voltage current from eachPV cell into useable, stable bus voltage for powering spacecraft systems despite issuessuch as non-uniform illumination, PV cell degradation, and decay of the GPHS source. Inthis project, Creare and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) propose todevelop an advanced, multi-channel maximum power point tracking module (MPPT) that isoptimized for RTPV systems. The converter will provide stable output voltage from a16-cell PV array that, when coupled with advanced PV technology of the RTPV system, willprovide high system efficiency. In Phase I, we will design a prototype power trackingmodule, which will be fully characterized for conversion efficiency. We will also assessthe impact of this new MPPT on the overall RTPV system design and performance.

<DESC>In collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology and its industrialpartners, proposes to develop and demonstrate innovative technologies to integrateanomaly detection and failure prognosis algorithms into automated fault mitigationstrategies for advanced aircraft controls. Traditional reactive fault tolerant controlapproaches fail to provide optimal fault mitigation over a long period of time toguarantee the integrity of the platform for the mission duration. We will create ageneric simulation environment to demonstrate fault detection and progression at thecomponent level, using electromechanical actuators as a testbench. The proposed AnomalyDetection/Mitigation system accepts sensor inputs, extracts features from raw data andemploys an anomaly detection module to determine the presence of an anomaly withperformance guarantees; a prognostic routine, built on Bayesian estimation (particlefiltering) techniques to estimate the remaining useful life of the component; finally, amitigation strategy trades off between performance and control authority to extend thelife of the failing component until the mission is completed. This innovativeprognostics-enhanced approach to fault mitigation uses Model Predictive Controltechniques running in real time. Core algorithms will be implemented on embedded systemsand used in hardware-in-the-loop demonstrations.

<DESC>SBIR/STTR Program - With the ever increasing complexity and duration ofInternational Space Station (ISS) missions, along with planned lunar and Martianmissions, the need for more advance capabilities for monitoring the astronaut crewenvironment becomes ever more critical. Accompanying this is an unprecedented need forreduction in instrumentation size, weight, and power consumption. Recent advances insensor technology have led to the development of miniature analytical instruments.However, many of these systems require a means of producing a vacuum with pressures under1 Torr to either supply a rough vacuum or to back a high vacuum pump such as a moleculardrag pump or turbo pump. Unfortunately, currently available rough vacuum pumps remainlarge, heavy, power hungry and unreliable. Lynntech proposes to develop a long-life,robust, low-power, miniature rough vacuum pump for trace gas contaminant monitors.

<DESC>SBIR/STTR Program - We are proposing to develop high altitude CO2 analyzertechnology that can be deployed on the research aircraft of NASA's Airborne ScienceProgram (ASP). The ultimate scientific goal is the calibration/validation of CO2observations made from spacecraft. Two forms of the analyzer are to be developed, pod forunmanned aircraft and rack for more general purpose platforms. The CO2 payloads are smalland light enough to perform on all 15 platforms of NASA-ASP, some reaching altitudes ofmore than 65,000' ASL and capable of probing at least 95% of the atmospheric column. Byprior work, we have built a prototype having the appropriate levels of sensitivity (0.10ppmv), bias (&lt;0.10 ppmv) and spatial/temporal resolution (1 Hz). Consequently, we caninitiate our program with Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 5-6. Validation of theprototype was on a piloted aircraft by a second airborne AOS analyzer system of the samespecifications and by flask samples analyzed by NOAA/GMD. Observations, some reachingaltitudes of 26,000' ASL, were referred to the WMO scale of CO2 DMF by use of referencegases. As a result of prior technological and scientific work, our Phase I program canpresent a detailed plan for achievement of TRL 9.

<DESC>SBIR/STTR Program - A constant demand exists to improve the sensitivity of tracechemical species measurement systems, which is often limited by the performance of theinfrared photon detector components. The significant cooling required to reduce darkcurrents and increase detectivities is a practical concern associated with these infrareddetectors. For geostationary and low-Earth orbital platforms, passive cooling systemshave been developed to provide a suitable means of incorporating such high-performanceinfrared detectors. The passive cooling system for the Crosstrack Infrared Sounder hasprovided a means to achieve a set point of 81 K for long-wavelength infrared detectoroperation. We will develop in this proposed effort the technology for high-performance,passively-cooled infrared (6-14 microns spectral range) detectors with integratedcapabilites for Fabry-Perot spectroscopy. The proposed sensors will be based on HgCdTematerial for high detectivities and use an Auger-suppression technique to reduce coolingrequirements. HgCdTe detectors capable of operating under passive cooling conditions willbe designed, fabricated and tested. In parallel, Fabry-Perot cavities suitable for futureintegration with the HgCdTe infrared detectors will be designed, fabricated and tested.The infrared detector arrays and tunable Fabry Perot cavities will be integrated in laterphases of the proposed project.

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY</span></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this notice to announce the award of Task Order #0008 to Environment International Government, LTD (EP-W-07-096) from the Targeted Brownfields Assessments (TBA) Contracts Request For Offer # 40 and to obligate funding in the amount of $91,956.93. The period of performance will be from January 4, 2010 though September 28, 2010.</p>
<p>This Task Order shall entail contractor performance of a phase I and phase II Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in accordance with requirements set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW) for the National TBA contract (contract solicitation PR-HQ-07-11297) and in consultation with the EPA Region III Task Order Project Officer (TOPO). <br />The overall objectives of this TBA are to:<br />1. Complete Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs) at four sites within the I&#8208;180 corridor in accordance with AAI and the ASTM E&#8208;1527&#8208;05 standard.<br />2. Perform one Phase II ESA to make determinations of the types and general extent of soil and groundwater contamination that may exist on the property.<br />3. Utilize published Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and federal risk&#8208;based regulatory standards to determine the risks associated with the contaminants;<br />4. Develop potential alternatives for clean&#8208;up; and<br />5. Estimate order of magnitude costs of implementing the clean&#8208;up alternatives that will help support decision making concerning future redevelopment of the Site.<br />The four sites to be investigated include a 1.3&#8208;acre parcel located at 410 East 3rd Street, a 0.9&#8208;acre parcel at 202 Basin Street, a 0.34&#8208;acre parcel at 849 West 3rd Street, and a 0.24&#8208;acre parcel at 301 West 3rd Street. A Phase I ESA will be completed at all four sites and a Phase II ESA will be conducted at the property at 410 East 3rd Street.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Brownfields and Land Revitalization (OBLR) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OBLR contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OBLR contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO BE AWARDED TO EXISTING CONTRACTHOLDERS. REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ANSWERED.</span></strong></p>
