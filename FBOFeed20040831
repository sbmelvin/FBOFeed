<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region, intends to enter into a sole-source contract with California Polytechnic State University (CPSU), Irrigation Training and Research Center, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407, telephone 805-756-2434.  This technical assistance is required to identify new opportunities for water conservation and improved water management within the Upper Columbia Area.  This is the last phase of what was previously acquired under a five year cooperative agreement between Bureau of Reclamation and CPSU.  Because of this history, the relationship between Reclamation and CPSU, and the relationship between CPSU and irrigation districts, we believe CPSU is uniquely qualified for this requirement.  CPSU has gained an extensive field-based understanding of the irrigation districts' facilities, personnel, and water management issues.  For these reasons we do not believe that anyone else could fulfill this requirement at a fair and reasonable price.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Inquiries will be accepted by FAX at 208-378-5108, attention Sue Fraser, or by email to sfraser@pn.usbr.gov.

<DESC>The Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a new requirement for conducting a study to assess the outcomes of a group of lung cancer patients treated with homeopathic therapy in a clinic in Calcutta, India.  Specifically, the OCCAM will support a prospective observational outcome study of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients in this particular homeopathy clinic.  The purpose of this contract is: 1) to document the number of new lung cancer patients seen in the clinic; 2) to identify each patient and determine their eligibility for the outcomes monitoring protocol (protocol will be provided by the OCCAM); 3) to follow 30 of the eligible patients for 2 years after enrollment into the study to assess tumor response, patient survival and quality of life; and 4) to document the homeopathic therapies received by the study participants.

In order to accomplish the aims of this project, the OCCAM will seek Contractors having both expertise in clinical and cancer research, as well as affiliated offices or workforce in India (preferably in Calcutta or with easy means of access, to enable prompt and accurate accomplishments of all contract requirements).  Primary protocol objectives include:  1) Identifying eligible lung cancer patients to participate in the study; and 2) Following up study cohort as per protocol to determine the response rate of tumors detectable by radiography [Chest Computed Tomography Scans (CT scans)] in eligible lung cancer patients entered on this protocol through the P. Banerji Homeopathic Research (PBHRF) clinics.  Secondary protocol objectives include: 1) Progression-free survival of patients; 2) Overall survival of patients; and 3) Assessing changes in patient quality of life after starting therapy through the PBHRF clinics as well as changes in disease-related symptoms (e.g., chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, fatigue, weight loss, etc.) via administration of a validated quality of life assessment tool.  Additional protocol objectives include reviewing charts of additional cases of cancer remissions occurring in patients receiving homeopathic therapy (these cases will be identified on a case by case method as per request of the NCI Project Officer).

An optional supplemental cancer protocol(s) on other types of cancers (e.g., esophageal cancer) may be required to be carried out after the satisfactory completion of the accrual to the lung cancer protocol.  The decision to proceed with the implementation of the supplemental protocol(s) will be made by the NCI Project Officer during the first year of the lung cancer study.  In order to effect this supplemental work, the contract document will be written to include option provisions for each year of the contract.

This is a new requirement and the Request For Proposal (RFP) No. N02-CO-47019 will issued on or about September 15, 2004.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Research Contracts Branch, NCI (http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/). The Government anticipates one contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a period of three years with optional studies that will run concurrently with the base requirements.  The NAICS Code is 621498.  No Collect Calls will be accepted.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA), a nonprofit Illinois corporation for the development, review, and testing of mappings between SNOMED CT©  and ICD-9-CM as well as any successor HIPAA standards.  The period of performance for this purchase order is one year with three successive one-year option periods.

NLM previously contracted with the College of American Pathologists (CAP) for a perpetual U.S.-wide license for its SNOMED CT vocabulary.  With advice from the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, the cross-agency Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) eGov initiative has designated SNOMED CT as one of a number of U.S. government-wide clinical data standards.  It is a major Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) priority to promote the adoption and use of these standards throughout the U.S.  To this end, HHS has given the NLM responsibility for funding, coordinating, and/or performing mappings between SNOMED CT and other important vocabularies (including those designated as administrative standards under the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)) and for working to align clinical vocabulary and messaging standards.  The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) and HHS have assigned a particularly high priority to the creation of robust mappings between SNOMED CT and several other vocabularies, including CPT, ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, MedDRA, and Medcin.

Under this acquisition, AHIMA shall: (1) Assist in the development, review, and testing of mappings between SNOMED CT and ICD-9-CM. (a) Identify, jointly with NLM, other vocabulary producers, and representative users of mappings, the business case(s) to be addressed and the basic mapping parameters for mappings between SNOMED CT and ICD-9-CM.  (b) Review and revise as appropriate the existing mapping between SNOMED CT and ICD-9-CM to ensure that it accurately reflects business case(s) identified in 1a and the meaning and usage of SNOMED CT and ICD-9-CM. (c) Develop, jointly with NLM, other vocabulary producers, other relevant government agencies, and representative users, plans for testing, validation, revision, and ongoing maintenance of mappings between SNOMED CT and ICD-9-CM. (2) Assist in the development, review, and testing of mappings between SNOMED CT and any successor HIPAA standards to ICD-9-CM as needed.

AHIMA is uniquely qualified to offer the above services.  AHIMA is a leading professional association representing more than 40,000 members consisting of specially educated and certified health information management (HIM) professionals who work throughout the healthcare industry.  AHIMA professionals serve the healthcare industry and the public by managing, analyzing, and utilizing data vital for health system management.  AHIMA also provides education in the area of coding and general health information management.  AHIMA professionals have extensive expertise and experience in the use and interpretation of ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM.  AHIMA is an active participant in the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee which is responsible for maintenance of ICD-9-CM in the United States.  They are one of four members of the Cooperating Parties which is responsible for approval of the content of “Coding Clinical for ICD-9-CM,” (an American Hospital Association publication that provides official ICD-9-CM coding advice) and development and approval of the Official ICD-9-CM Guidelines for Coding and Reporting.  The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, has recognized AHIMA as authoritative experts on the structure and meaning of ICD-9-CM.  AHIMA worked closely with the NCHS on the development of ICD-10-CM and is providing official training to the healthcare community on the use of ICD-10-CM.  AHIMA partnered with the American Hospital Association to conduct a study assessing the functionality and utility of applying ICD-10-CM codes rather than ICD-9-CM codes in medical records.  

AHIMA professionals also have extensive expertise and experience in the use and interpretation of SNOMED CT.  In June 2001 AHIMA and SNOMED International (a subsidiary of the College of American Pathologists (CAP), the producer and copyright holder of SNOMED RT/CT) established a working relationship to develop use cases and create mappings between SNOMED RT (the predecessor to SNOMED CT) and ICD-9-CM.  The two groups have since collaborated with the NCHS to develop and validate a draft map between SNOMED CT and ICD-9-CM that will form the basis for the work to be conducted through this PO.  

Due to its unique working relationship with both CAP and the NCHS, AHIMA is the only organization capable of providing the services required in this statement of work in a timely and efficient manner.

This service will be solicited using FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) procedures and awarded using FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).  

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Extensive and recent experience in interpreting the content of SNOMED CT and ICD-9-CM. 2) Extensive and recent experience in creating, validating, and maintaining mappings between SNOMED CT and ICD-9-CM. 3) Be able to effect change in ICD-9-CM through active participation in the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee.

Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-230/LMF shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Lynn Furtaw on 301-496-6546 or furtawl@mail.nih.gov.

The software development and field site support will focus on the completion of traffic management unit evaluations (begun under Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT)) and the conduct of operational time-based metering evaluations of McTMA at the six FAA field site facilities: New York, Washington, Boston, and Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), and the Air Traffic Control System Command Center.  The prior effort was first obtained under the NAS2-00014, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) contract under a contract task order (CTO-03). Contract Tasks were competed amongst the Air Traffic Management System Development and Integration (ATMSDI) contractors. The requirements were stated in performance-based Contract Task Orders (CTOs) in the areas concerning ATM automation technologies and related activities.	 This effort is for the continued provision of the highly specialized services currently provided for under contract task order CTO-03. In this original contract, three phases of development were defined; because of schedule delays in the project, only the first two phases were completed by the end of FY04. The contract proposed here is to continue the effort and the work originally specified to be completed under CTO-03, Phase 3.  The supplies or services required are all focused on the air transportation domain, or project management, systems engineering, technical direction, software integration, software engineering including development, architecture and infrastructure, engineering and analysis, as well as field site support for field testing activities. The requirement is for a three-year period beginning October 1, 2004.  It will be a two-year base period with a single, one-year option period. As set forth above, award to any source other than CSC for this follow-on contract for the continued provision of the highly specialized services currently provided for under contract task order CTO-03 would result in (A) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; and (B) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  Therefore, as set forth above, the Government will issue a sole source follow-on contract to CSC, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 See Note “26”. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on September 15, 2004.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B"

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Project Selection and Portfolio Management Support to the Integrated Space Operations Summit (ISOS) Integration Panel. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from SEBA Solutions, Inc (SEBA) pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1. The key personnel of SEBA Solutions, Inc., is uniquely qualified to provide project selection and portfolio management support to the Integrated Space Operations Summit (ISOS).  The ISOS requires that the prioritization/project selection process employed be credible and mathematically sound.  NASA has been criticized in the past for selecting improvement processes that lacked credibility and traceability.  The ability to employ the necessary soft skills to delicately resolve issues among stakeholders, the technical skills to address the complex mathematical structure behind the Analytic Hierarchy Process, the knowledge of NASA attained over twenty years of service to the Agency as a civil servant and a contractor, make personnel of SEBA uniquely qualified to support the ISOS. 2. The key personnel of SEBA is a certified Project Management Professional (PMP) and has detailed knowledge of the project initiation phase of the project life cycle.  The project initiation phase is where prioritization/project selection processes are applied as in the case of ISOS.  SEBA’s key personnel’s knowledge is widely recognized in this area and he is frequently an invited guest speaker at professional society meetings to speak on portfolio project management and project selection methods.   3. The key personnel of SEBA has a wealth of NASA experience and has worked at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center in the Space Shuttle Program.  More specifically in supporting MSFC, he was instrumental to facilitation and training of the 2004 Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) Integration Panel.	Successful implementation, management and project prioritization process was the basis for the success achieved on the SLEP.  The ISOS is an extension of the SLEP process with the broadened scope which encompasses the International Space Station. His communication skills, knowledge of the process and knowledge of NASA allow him to effectively interface with the highly technical NASA personnel up to the Senior Executive Service level participating in the SLEP and now ISOS process with unquestionable credibility.   4. Additionally, the key personnel of SEBA has completed specialized training in Expertchoice software.	This software was utilized by the SLEP panel and is now being employed by the ISOS Integration Panel as a basis for project selection.  Expertchoice is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process and he not only has had formal academic training on this process but has taught the process in academic and corporate settings including Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center.	His knowledge of the software and its capabilities is comprehensive to the point that he has provided improvement recommendations and identified bugs in the software for the Expertchoice.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Hope Rayburn at hope.rayburn@msfc.nasa.gov later than 12:00 p.m. local time on September 7, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-24.  This solicitation is being issued under Request For Quotation  (RFQ) No. 090338.  This solicitation is under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program, and is 100% set aside for Small Business.  The NAICS is 238330 and the Business Size Standards is $12 million.  This will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract.

CLIN 3:  removal and replacement of 126 yards of carpet tile in corridor 3 also with factory laminated carpet color "Cortez."

The required analyzer, must be identical to the currently installed unit to allow “drop in” capabilities.  This is necessary for preventative maintenance as well as in the event of damage to the analyzer.  Analyzer includes Channel 1;  4 field selectable ranges from 0-1,000 ppm to 10,000 ppm CO; Channel 2:  4 field selectable ranges from 0-5,000 ppm to 50,000 ppm CO2, Outputs:  Two 0/2/4-20mA, RS485 and 6 configurable relays, Sample Gas Monitoring, Power: 120VAC 60Hz, Auto calibration, Connections:  ¼” tube, Materials:  Viton tubing and aluminum lined sample cell and sealed reference cell, Enclosure:  19” rack mount.  Since the existing instrumentation is proprietary no other source is available for the required application.

Delivery shall be FOB origin, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 7-8 weeks after receipt of order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

<CONTACT>Tiffany Stuck, Contract Specialist , Phone 703-681-0752, Email stuckt@ncr.disa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Information System Agency (DISA)/ Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization – National Capital Region (DITCO-NCR) hereby issues the following Request for Information (RFI) regarding a follow on contract to the Defense Message System (DMS) Transition Hub Software and Systems Engineering, and Transition Support contract to expire July 2005.  This RFI is prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12 for Commercial Items.  
A. PURPOSE:  The Government seeks information for providing Command and Control messaging requirement capabilities primarily via the National Gateway Center (NGC) and DMS infrastructure, and operational support required to enable Command and Control communications interoperability between the multiple messaging solutions implemented by the services and agencies. The information gathered on industry capabilities from this RFI will assist in the development of a future Request for Proposal.  
B. INTENT:  The RFI is intended to gather information about the availability of technology/products in the market place that will fulfill anticipated requirements for these services and other value-added elements. Information submitted in response to this RFI will become the property of the Government.  The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. This request for information or "sources sought" shall not be construed as a request for proposal.  Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.  The Government will not pay for information provided, and is not liable for any costs incurred by the company in response to this RFI.  Price quotes are not required, however, general cost estimates are appreciated to assist in planning.  Cost estimates provided will not be binding for the company.  The government is anticipating the competitive award of a one (1) year base period with four (4) one (1) year option periods for a total of five years, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract (or multiple contracts, if determined to be in the best interest of the Government).
C. DESIRED INFORMATION:  The Government desires information on industry capabilities to support the services and features listed below.  This list is neither detailed nor all-inclusive, but is a representative of the type of services the Government is interested in.  The Government will consider responses to this request for information in defining its requirements and alternatives.  Draft task areas include: The National Gateway Center legacy component software life cycle maintenance for the Message Processor, Line Traffic Coordinator, Line Control Module, Line Terminator Unit, System Alarm Panel, System Command Console, Bulk Storage Subsystem, and Monitor Test and Status Subsystem.  This unique assembly language message switching software is approximately 35 years old, does not use commercial operating systems, and has been modified several thousand times.  Because of its age and unique real-time functionality, the current operational NGC legacy software is unstructured and poorly documented. Other task areas include: software maintenance/database update of the NGC Acceptance Test Procedures Replacement System (ATPRS), and DMS Message Conversion System; NGC tool maintenance/enhancement to support operational requirements and legacy/DMS database synchronization; engineering support of legacy users not fully transitioned to DMS; system engineering support for analysis and resolution of operational DMS user and interface issues; Command and Control messaging evolution support; independent technical review of proposed system/architectural design changes and issue resolutions; independent product functionality and integration testing of DMS backbone and service level component software, to include test plan and test report generation; engineering support for requirements definition and operational  implementation of an Allied Gateway messaging capability and other capabilities required to sustain Allied messaging interoperability; generation of DITSCAP and related documentation required for security accreditation and certification of Command and Control messaging systems; support to the DMS Global Systems Manager for the creation and maintenance of global DMS operational documentation (e.g., Interim Procedures, CONOPS and DISA Circulars), providing  configuration management and asset control functions, and procurement assistance for DMS infrastructure technology refresh; and, organizational messaging transition engineering.  It is the intent of the Government to award all task areas under one contract in order to maintain a comprehensive Command and Control messaging approach to fully address operational messaging requirements from a global perspective.  A SECRET clearance is required by all contractor personnel.  TOP SECRET clearance and SCI/SIOP accesses are required by approximately Sixty percent (60%) of contractor personnel.  
D. SUBMISSION OF COMMENTS:  Interested contractors are requested to submit capability statements that explicitly address all task areas individually and collectively as a whole.  Capability statements must include specific corporate and personnel expertise relative to each tasking area.  Capability statements must also clearly demonstrate past company successes in providing responsive and effective actions when tasked with software and system life cycle maintenance responsibilities of an operational Command and Control communications system.  All comments in response to this RFI should be submitted electronically via e-mail not later than 1200 EST on 15 September 2004 using MS Word 7.0 or later.  The point-of-contact for submitting comments is Major Joseph Jupiter at JupiterJ@ncr.disa.mil.  Comments received after that date may not be considered.  Proprietary information should be identified as such.  Contractors are to include the name, address, telephone number, and email address of their point(s) of contact; capability and expertise statements as requested above; the company's business size, including applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code(s); and a list of references.  Expect a draft RFP to be posted to the Contracting Opportunities Home Page in the fall of 2004.  If you experience any problems or have any questions concerning this request for information, call Major Joseph Jupiter between the hours of 0900 and 1700 hours EST, Monday through Friday.
A list of interested companies that respond to this request will be made available on DITCO’s web site at www.ditco.disa.mil.  This is intended to facilitate partnerships/subcontracting opportunities.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences’ (DCCPS), Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB) plans to procure on a sole source basis 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities to search the UCSF Library’s Legacy Tobacco Documents Library (LTDL) from Regents of the University of California, San Francisco, UCSF Library/Center for Knowledge Management, Legacy Tobacco Documents Library, 530 Parnassus Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94143.  The mission of the Tobacco Control Research Branch is to lead and collaborate on research, and to disseminate evidence-based findings to prevent, treat, and control tobacco use.  Landmark tobacco litigation brought by the state Attorneys General and others, Congressional inquiries and the Food and Drug Administration have resulted in the release of millions of previously inaccessible tobacco industry internal documents.  The NCI issued a Program Announcement (PAR 99-114 and PAR 01-063) to stimulate research on a wide variety of scientific, technical, marketing and tactical undertakings by the tobacco industry, as documented in these materials.  As a result of this PAR, numerous NCI grantees are engaged in the study of these documents.  The NCI wishes to further facilitate this research by enhancing researchers’ access to the tobacco industry documents by providing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities to search these documents through a large, stable and well-staffed electronic database.  The UCSF Library’s Legacy Tobacco Documents Library (LTDL) was established in 2001 to serve the needs of the tobacco industry documents research community.  It is supported by a staff of librarians and technical specialists, and contains the largest and most stable collection of tobacco industry documents.  The infrastructure to provide OCR searchable text of the Library’s images must be tightly coupled to the file systems, databases and programs developed for the LTDL.  The LTDL shall develop, install and configure a PC  “grid” infrastructure for the purpose of producing searchable PDF files from document images.  The contractor shall produce searchable text from at least 20 million pages of document images contained in the UCSF LTDL.  The LTDL provides unique capabilities to accomplish the goal of providing OCR capabilities to researchers and is, therefore, the only organization known to the NCI researcher that can meet all of the requirements.  The LTDL is the only website which houses a large and stable collection, well-staffed by librarians and technical specialists.  This service is considered commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 8, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS 541990, Size Standard 6M.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose for this modification is to respond to questions asked that are relevant to all potential bidders for the Field Network Pilot Study Proposal Solicitation. 

1.  The statement of work lists the planning phase as five months and the implementation phase as nine months, for a total of 14 months.  It also states that the period of performance is 12 months (10-1-04 thru 09-30-05).  What is the intended length of the contract?
 
Response: The intended length of the contract is 14 months.
 
2.  The RFP indicates that up to four field researchers need to be identified, which corresponds to the largest number of states allowed in the pilot study.  Does the Corporation anticipate that one field researcher per state will be sufficient?
 
Response: The number of field researchers will depend upon the proposed sampling strategy and the capacity of the field researchers to conduct the necessary site visits and research at the selected sites. The Corporation expects that the number of field researchers will be adequate to conduct the pilot while remaining cost efficient.
 
3.  Is the Rockefeller Institute of Government eligible to compete for this contract?
 
Response: The Rockefeller Institute of Government is eligible to compete for the contract.
 
4.  We are assuming that all the data collection approaches mentioned in the evaluation plan need to be tested during the contract.  Please confirm.
 
Response: Yes. One of the intentions of the pilot study is to test the data collection approaches proposed in the evaluation plan.
 
5.  Are the abstract and the table of contents included in the 20 page limit?
 
Response: The abstract and the table of contents are included in the 20 page limit.
 
6.  The number of states and number of focal points within states will directly affect costs.  Please provide guidance regarding the estimated level of effort for the contract.
 
Response: The estimated level of effort for the contract is $250,000. The number of focal points within states should be sufficient to provide the Corporation with data and feedback that is inclusive of the scope of Corporation programs (including a range of organizational types) and diverse geographic and demographic areas. For further information on sampling, please refer to the evaluation plan.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

LIABILITY AND INSURANCE (CAR 1352.217-96) (JAN 1987)
    (a) The Contractor shall exercise reasonable care and use its best efforts to prevent accidents, injury or damage to all employees, persons and property, in and about the work, and to the vessel or part thereof upon which work is done.
    (b) The Contractor shall be responsible for and make good at its own cost and expense any and all loss of or damage of whatsoever nature to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo, and Government owned material and equipment for the repair, completion, alteration of or addition to the vessel in the possession of the Contractor, whether at the plant or elsewhere, arising or growing out of the performance of the work, except where the Contractor can affirmatively show that such loss or damage was due to causes beyond the Contractor s control, was proximately caused by the fault or negligence of agents or employees of the Government, or which loss or damage the Contractor by exercise of reasonable care was unable to prevent. However, the Contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless (i) the loss or damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and (ii) loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault or negligence of the Contractor. To induce the Contractor to perform the work for the compensation provided, it is specifically agreed that the Contractor’s aggregate liability on account of loss of or damage to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and Government owned materials and equipment shall in no event exceed the sum of $300,000. As to the Contractor, the Government assumes the risk of loss or damage to the Government-owned vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and said Government-owned materials and equipment in excess of $300,000. This assumption of risk includes but is not limited to loss or damage from negligence of whatsoever degree of the Contractor’s servants, employees, agents or subcontractors but specifically excludes loss or damage from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the Contractor’s directors, officers and any of its managers, superintendents or other equivalent representatives, who have supervision or direction of (i) all or substantially all of the Contractor’s business, or (ii) all or substantial all of the Contractor’s operation at any one plant. However, as to such risk assumed and borne by the Government, the Government shall be subrogated to any claim, demand or cause of action against third persons which exists in favor of the Contractor, and the contractor shall, if required, execute a formal assignment or transfer of claims, demands or causes of action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall create or give rise to any right, privilege or power in any person except the Contractor, nor shall any person (except the Contractor) be or become entitled thereby to proceed directly against the Government, or join the Government as a co-defendant in any action against the Contractor brought to determine the Contractor’s liability, or for any other purpose.
    (c) The Contractor indemnifies and holds harmless the Government, its agencies and instrumentality's, and the vessel against all suits, actions, claims, costs or demands (including without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury and property damage) to which the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, or the vessel may be subject or put by reason of damage or injury (including death) to the property or person of any one other than the Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and personnel, or the vessel arising or resulting in whole or in part from the fault, negligence, wrongful act or wrongful omission of the Contractor, or any subcontractor, its or their servants, agents or employees; provided that the Contractor’s obligation to indemnify under this paragraph (c) shall not exceed the sum of $300,000 on account of any one accident or occurrence in respect of any one vessel.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR THE SPACE COMMUNICATIONS ARCHITECTURE WORKING GROUP, Solicitation No. RFI-04-HBD-003 which was posted on July 14, 2004. You are notified of the following: The purpose of this amended request is to collect information that will be relevant to planning NASA's ground network for the future Space Communications Architecture.  This request falls within the overall description of the previous solicitation.   At present, the Space Communications Architecture is being planned within NASA.  With this Request for Information, NASA is seeking information for cost estimates for services related to ground stations to perform the following functions: 1.  Telemetry, tracking, and control (TTC) of lunar orbiters with 24 hours, 7 days coverage.  The estimate may assume that as many as three (3) orbiters will be present at any one time but that coverage is only when orbiters are not obscured by the moon. 2.  Telemetry, tracking, and control (TTC) of Government Earth orbiters with 24 hours, 7 days for Launch Early Orbit and Anomaly (LEO and A) coverage.  The estimate may assume the present number of thirty (30) NASA satellites.  Also anomaly coverage is required for NOAA satellites.   The following can be assumed for both situations: 1. The estimated start date for such services will begin in 2009. 2. The TTC will operate at Unified S-Band (USB). Cost and reliability estimates are requested by September 15, 2004, or earlier.  Estimates received after that date will also be useful, but less impactful. No procurement is planned for this request or as part of the Space Communications Architecture planning activity.  However, companies interested in describing their technology to NASA are encouraged to supply documentation in a format of their choosing.  You are encouraged to monitor this site as additional amendment posting(s) may follow.	 Reference:  The NASA websites include a full description of the Vision for Space Exploration.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR SOURCES SOUGHT – OVERSIZED REUSABLE CONTAINER ASSEMBLY. Kaiser-Hill Company, LLC (Contractor), is the Integrating Management Contractor at DOE's Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) near Denver, Colorado. Kaiser-Hill Company, LLC is attempting to identify companies with already manufactured, readily available commercial containers meeting the general requirements and specific dimensions stated below for two (2) different container configurations. These containers will be used to overpack RFETS site existing cargo containers that do not meet acceptable site and DOT shipping criteria. Existing site cargo containers vary in size, however, the minimum dimensions specified below will accommodate the largest container planned for shipment. Companies should contact the below referenced Procurement Agent only if they have already manufactured containers available that meet or can meet stated requirements with minimal modification (i.e., do not require design and/or manufacturing). Containers will have to be supported by a welding program based on nationally recognized standards appropriate for the material being welded as well as an inspection program. Calculation(s) for lifting attachments will also be required from any chosen company. General Container Requirements: 1) The container shall be an open top container equipped with a cover such as an industrial grade canvas tarp (15-oz./sq. yd. minimum); 2) The container cover shall be designed so that it will not retain standing water or permit water to leak into the container; 3) The container shall be liquid tight; 4) The minimum inside height (floor to top of container) shall not be less than 120” +/- 1/2”; 5) The container shall incorporate lifting devices to facilitate loading and unloading by forklift onto a drop deck trailer or railcar. Forklift pockets must be greater than or equal to 4.5” high x 14” wide. Each lifting attachment that is a structural part of the package must be designed, analyzed or tested to meet a 3:1 ultimate strength factor; 6) Materials – basic construction steel, manufacturer’s standard (frame, walls and floor); 7) Finishes – Prime exterior with rust inhibitive primer per manufacturer’s standard. Exterior finish per manufacturer’s standard; and 8) Ability to be reused multiple times to safely transport its contents to an out-of-state waste disposal site. Configuration I (Need 3 Units) - In addition to the stated general container requirements, this configuration shall meet these additional requirements: 1) The opening in the top shall be a minimum of 264” L x 118” W +/- 1/2” and shall be unobstructed; 2) Maximum outside dimensions shall be no larger than the following dimensions – 276” L x 126” W x 132” H +/- 1/2”; and 3) Payload capacity shall be greater than/equal to 50,000 pounds. Configuration 2 (Need 1 Unit) - In addition to the stated general container requirements, this configuration shall meet these additional requirements: 1) The opening in the top shall be a minimum of 504” L x 118” W +/- 1/2” and shall be unobstructed; 2) Maximum outside dimensions shall be no larger than the following dimensions – 512” L x 126” W x 132” H +/- 1/2”; and 3) Payload capacity shall be greater than/equal to 60,000 pounds. This advertisement is NOT A SOLICITATION. Responses will be evaluated to determine the feasibility of using already existing containers and possibly developing a list of subcontractors to provide responses to an issued solicitation, which may require additional requirements and/or submittals. Any questions and/or responses shall be submitted in writing to Elizabeth Straub at FAX number (303) 966-7899 or e-mail address Elizabeth.Straub@rfets.gov by close of business September 10, 2004.

General Scope					
1. SCOPE
1.1 General Scope Description
This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the scope, requirements, and criteria necessary to obtain engineering services for the preparation of a Conceptual Design Report (CDR) for the Component Evaluation Facility (CEF).  A CDR provides the technical, cost, and schedule basis for a project during the DOE budget process.  This basis must adequately describe the project’s justification, scope, schedule, and cost.  However, the report should not contain unnecessary details that do not contribute to the overall understanding of the project.  The CDR documents the outcome of the conceptual design phase and forms the basis for the preliminary baseline.  It is the anchor document for the initial project validation.
This SOW also include scope, requirements, and criteria for the preparation of a Design Criteria (DC) document, which defines the project technical scope that the designer/constructor must follow for the preparation of next phase of design.  In this case, the DC document will define the requirements and criteria for the preliminary design and definitive design phases (Title I and Title II design services).
The scope of this SOW is limited to AE services for conceptual design activities.  BWXT Pantex will evaluate the performance of the successful AE during the conceptual phase for conformance to the requirements of this SOW as well as for conformance to the successful AE’s proposal budget and schedule.  Using this evaluation, BWXT Pantex will make a determination on extending this scope to the successful AE for Title I, II, and III design services.

1.2 Background
The Pantex Plant is located in the Texas panhandle approximately 17 miles northeast of Amarillo.  It is a Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear weapons plant managed and operated by the prime contractor, BWXT Pantex, LLC.  The Capital and Expense Projects Division (C&EPD) within BWXT Pantex is responsible for execution of projects that are necessary to satisfy the Stockpile Life Extension Program and that enhance the Pantex Plant operations.
The CEF is a new facility that will increase existing capacities and provide new capabilities for the Pantex Plant.  Additional bays and improved non-destructive evaluation equipment will provide much needed additional capacity.  New capabilities will meet the increasing demands for higher diagnostic precision and finer definition in testing and analysis by employing state of the art equipment.

1.3 General Facility Description
The CEF Mission Need Statement (MNS) document describes this structure as a non-reactor nuclear facility as defined by 10 CFR 830.3 Nuclear Safety Management.  The CEF MNS also describes this facility as a 75,000 square foot bay complex that houses and supports the necessary process equipment along with a 4,300 square foot ramp that connects the facility to other structures within the complex.  The facility will be located in the Zone 12 Material Access Area (MAA).

This specialized mail extracting system is designed to automatically extract pre-qualified checks and documents from windowed and non-windowed envelopes for efficient document processing in high-volume environments. The SSA has previously conducted extensive market research and determined that the OPEX MPE 7.5 multi-purpose mail extractor with the aforementioned features is the only device of its type that can meet the Government’s high-volume incoming mail extraction requirements, and that OPEX Corporation is the sole source for purchase of this specific equipment. Any responsible firm that sells mail extraction machines capable meeting or exceeding the following minimum performance specifications: 1) Input Feed speed capability of 7500 pieces per hour; 2) Parcel thickness detection; 3) Parcel metal detection; 4) Three-sided cutting capability with edge milling; 5) Parcel extraction and extraction verification capability; 6) Extraction & Stacking of Multi-Document Transactions; 7) Extraction & Stacking of Three-Piece Transactions; 8)  Sortation capability that detects for metal and thickness for exception processing; 9)  Thick Stacking capability that removes envelope contents for stacking (up to twelve differing paper thicknesses);  10)  Parcel content reuniting capability; 11) Orienting capability that places checks and documents into appropriately oriented position; 12)  Microsoft Windows compatibility; 13) capability to handle both windowed and non-windowed envelopes, with different lengths and heights (length: 5.5 inches to 9.38 inches, height: 2.75 inches to 4.25 inches), may respond in writing no later than September 10, 2004 with capability statements and specifications information describing in FULL DETAIL their product’s capabilities to accomplish SSA's objective. Additionally, respondents should cite specific examples of their experience in providing machines of this type to other very high volume mail handling operations. Interested parties that feel they can provide these products may respond by submitting their capability statement by email to Randall.Pickwell@ssa.gov by September 10, 2004. All responses shall be marked “CAPABILITY STATEMENT-High Volume Mail Extracting Equipment”. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITION FOR OFFERS. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received by the cutoff date (September 10, 2004), the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with OPEX Corporation. Again, all questions and submissions in response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the e-mail address listed above. Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being issued as a request for quotation. Submit offers on RML-RFQ # 4056. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24–dated 06/18/04. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 and the small business size is $6.0. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Office of the Associate Director(OAD) is in need of Bio-safety, Bio-containment and Bio-security Review Services. After the events of September 11, 2001, and subsequent anthrax infections, President Bush tasked the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases(NIAID) to increase its research into the development of safe and effective counter-measures to protect the public against emerging infections and the threat of biological agents that could be used for bioterrorism. Towards achievement of the goals outlined in the NIAID Strategic Plan for Biodefense Research, the Division of Intramural Research(DIR), NIAID is required to construct and commission appropriate bio-containment facilities in the United States. An integral element of this priority initiative will be the development of procedures and processes to handle/monitor potentially lethal agents and to minimize the threat to the laboratory facility, its clinical/research personnel, and the surrounding community. The research studies/programs at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) are expanding to help develop new understanding, diagnostics, vaccines and treatments for infectious diseases, with priority emphasis on those relevant to bio-defense. To assure that research is carried out safely for both the scientists and the community, a new Integrated Research Facility (IRF) will be built on the RML campus. A relatively small portion of the IRF will contain Bio-safety Level (BSL) 4 laboratories, with the remaining space devoted to BSL-3 and BSL-2 laboratories, animal procedure and holding, offices and conference rooms. Through the design phase of the RML IRF project, NIAID DIR has drawn upon the expertise and experience of BSL-4 scientists, facility managers and bio-safety specialists. The engagement of these experts has led to a building design that will be a state-of-the art facility, and serve as a model, world-wide, for future high bio-containment facilities. In addition, RML has an existing state-of-the-art BSL-3 bio-containment facility, Building 25. Building 25 houses several research laboratory suites, a BSL-3 vivarium, and associated support functions. Several agents studied in the BSL-3 are on the Select Agent List. Building 25 will be linked to the IRF, and scientist access to Building 25 will be via the IRF. SCHEDULE: Integrated Research Facility: We are now at a crucial point in the process where we require the review and expertise of a Safety & Occupational Health Expert to develop the following: 1) Standard Operating Procedures for the IRF and associated Building 25 BSL-3 facility at RML; 2) Dedicated Bio-safety Manual for the IRF and associated Building 25 BSL-3 facility at RML; 3) Administrative tracking and monitoring procedures to insure compliance with regulations for work with select agents; 4) Training programs for the eventual management and operations of these facilities. Bio-safety, Bio-containment and Bio-security Review Services are required with the following requirements: 1) Provide Project Oversight and Review Services to evaluate bio-safety, bio-containment, and bio-security features for the RML IRF Facility: a) Evaluate construction, commissioning, operations and maintenance plans, specifications and procedures as developed by architects, engineers and other specialists on the project team; b) Develop written review comments representing NIAID DIR interests to other consultants, contractors, and federal staff involved with the project Delivery; c) When working with RML-IRF project team staff, facilitate the resolution of conflicts during the initial construction stages; d) Attend a wide range of meetings related to the IRF Project. 2) Coordinate and develop written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the RML IRF Facility based on established procedures and guidance defined by NIH organizations with jurisdictional authority.  When addressing building matters, base SOP development on the Modes of Operations developed for the RML IRF project by the project team.  The following organizational approach to the SOPs is suggested, but can be altered as needed:  Overview of the SOPs within the context of the RML campus operations (administrative, security, laboratory, vivarium, waste, interface with other facilities, etc.) a) IRF Facility Operations and Maintenance (laboratory and vivarium);  b) IRF Bio-safety, Bio-containment and Bio-security (laboratory and vivarium);  c) IRF Protocol Specific (laboratory and vivarium) once researchers are identified.  d) IRF Staff Security Clearance Process  e)  IRF Emergency Response.  The following are minimum elements to be included within each SOP:  i) Purpose for the SOP;  ii) Responsible Parties;  iii) Certifications required, if any, and the timing of those certifications;  iv) Relevance of the SOP to other RML, NIH, DHHS, or federal requirements (radiation safety, security, legal, etc.);  v) Step-by-Step Process and related procedures with flow diagrams included when applicable;  vi) Organizational oversight, monitoring, review and update processes for the SOP;  vii) Relevant documents required and location of those documents;  viii) Any critical timing issues for implementation of the SOP.  These SOPs need to be coordinated with the stipulations within the contract documents (drawings, specifications, commissioning, modes of operations, security and other contractual requirements) for the RML IRF project. Written verification of such coordination needs to accompany each segment of the SOP document. 3)  Develop staffing and financial projections for operating the RML IRF.  These should be based on the SOP Overview stipulations as defined above or modified based on the discussion and needs that arise in working with the Office of the Associate Director (OAD) at RML.  In addition, confirm staffing levels against the planning projections stated in the Program of Requirements for the RML IRF. a) Determine RML IRF facility staffing functions for maintenance, animal holding, bio-safety and laboratory support. Provide recommendations regarding the feasibility of recruiting federal workers versus contract support; b) Determine the number of staff needed to operate the facility as defined by the Overview for the SOPs.

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

Tajikistan is one of the poorest countries in the world.  A bitter civil war from 1992-1997 stunted Tajikistan’s economic development, hindered economic reforms and discouraged foreign investment.  The security situation has dramatically improved since the conclusion of Tajikistan’s civil war peace accords in 1997.  President Rakhmonov is eager to implement structural and economic reforms and has identified foreign investment as a top priority.  The United States government has been more pro-active in Tajikistan over the last year and is committed to promoting reform in Tajikistan.  

One of the areas that the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe believes has good potential for investment is hydroelectric power generation.  The collapse of the Soviet Union fractured a unified Central Asian energy network, resulting in Tajikistan having excess capacity in the summer and rolling blackouts in the winter.  Tajikistan has abundant and underdeveloped water resources and would like to become a net exporter of electricity.  The Tajik Minister of Energy believes that other international donors have shown little support for the government’s efforts in this sector and therefore has requested U.S. assistance.
 
Kyrgyzstan also has abundant water resources, mainly due to the country's location at the mountain headwaters of the Syrdarya, one of the two largest rivers in Central Asia.  Some international companies have expressed interest in investing in Kyrgyzstan’s hydroelectric energy especially if more contracts to sell the power to Kyrgyzstan’s neighbors could be negotiated.  With the growing population in China, and growing industry in Kazakhstan, the need for inexpensive power is increasing.  Only about 10 percent of Kyrgyzstan's hydroelectric power potential and only about 3 percent of the potential of its smaller streams are currently being exploited and so hold some opportunities for investment and rehabilitation.  The infrastructure needed for distribution of the power is also in need of rehabilitation.

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

Tajikistan is one of the poorest countries in the world.  A bitter civil war from 1992-1997 stunted Tajikistan’s economic development, hindered economic reforms and discouraged foreign investment.  The security situation has dramatically improved since the conclusion of Tajikistan’s civil war peace accords in 1997.  President Rakhmonov is eager to implement structural and economic reforms and has identified foreign investment as a top priority.  The United States government has been more pro-active in Tajikistan over the last year and is committed to promoting reform in Tajikistan.  

One of the areas that the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe believes has good potential for investment is the mining sector.  Tajikistan has rich natural resources including deposits of uranium, mercury, lead, zinc, antimony, tungsten, silver and gold.  Should these resources be developed, they could provide a hard currency source for Tajikistan.  Foreign firms, including a British company, are already involved in this sector in Tajikistan.  The Embassy believes that USTDA’s involvement at this stage is key to attracting interest in this sector from American companies.

USTDA funded a DM on this sector in 1997, which was conducted by the US Geological Survey.  The DM had some difficulty in obtaining sufficient information from the Tajiks but reported at that time that there are significant precious metal resources and medium sized gold deposits.  The report also noted that there was a significant lack of information on geology, resources, mining laws and procedures for obtaining exploration permits.
Now that there is interest in foreign investment and a greater interest from the Tajik side in cooperation, we believe that it is an appropriate time to take a second look at this sector.
