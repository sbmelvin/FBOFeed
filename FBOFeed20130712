The delivery period is from December 1, 2013, through November 30, 2016. <br /><br />Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this requirement has been identified for non-competitive contract action.

Interested parties should submit capability statement to the POC by July 19, 2013 at 1300 hours Eastern Daylight Time. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements by the closing date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The Government reserves the right to extend resulting contract on the same terms and conditions one or more times for a total of no more than six months. Notice of contract extension will be furnished to the Contractor not later than 30 days prior to expiration of the contract ordering period or any extension thereof.

The FAA currently anticipates award of these long-term contract vehicles in the Fall of 2013 and the Summer of 2014.  The FAA requires this single source ceiling increase in order to provide for the continuance of essential support services and an appropriate transition period while it completes the acquisition of long-term contracts.  

The Contract provides the support for all of the major financial systems for the FAA including the core financial and procurement systems.  The Contract supports the maintenance, enhancement, development, and overall IT support for all FAA major financial systems.  The systems supported include, the Cost Accounting System (CAS), DELPHI, PRISM, ARS, LDR and many feeder systems that support payroll, human resources and the FAA’s fee charging requirements.  This system support is critical and must be maintained for the FAA 24/7 and for all timeframes, i.e. eastern, western time zones.  
Contract No. DTFAWA-07-D-00010 supports critical data for the FAA’s financial audit such that no disruption of services is allowable with such critical mission sensitive systems.  Specifically, the Contract provides support services necessary to ensure that all of the major FAA financial systems are appropriately maintained and processing.  Without the support provided by this Contract, the FAA will lose the ability to update its financial system.  Additionally, the loss of access to the Contract would significantly impact the FAA’s ability to pay its obligations as this Contract also provides support for the PRISM procurement system. Finally, this Contract supports the financial reporting for the FAA’s financial audit.  The ability of the FAA to achieve a clean audit rating would significantly diminish without this Contract’s support.  In addition, the Oracle upgrade to version 12 in DELPHI is ongoing and must continue.

AIO has also absorbed several new financial systems that required support for maintenance, enhancements, and other modifications.  These systems are also critical to the FAA maintaining a clean audit and are part of the OMB mandated financial controls systems.

This ceiling increase will help maintain critical financial operations support until the new contract is awarded, provide time for transition between the contractors and provide risk coverage for any delays.  The approval of this ceiling increase is critical to the support and operations of the AIO-300 Office of Financial System Solutions. 
The use of a single source contract ceiling increase is in accordance with Acquisition Management System § 3.2.2.4 and is in the best interests of the FAA considering the following: that the FAA is in the process of obtaining long-term contract vehicles to provide continuing support services for the requirements currently performed under the Contract; this ceiling increase will allow the FAA to provide for continuation of services under the Contract while the FAA completes the process of obtaining long-term contract vehicles; the short period of time remaining until the ceiling of the Contract is exhausted, the effect a gap in services would have; the temporary nature of the continued use of the Contract until the work can be transitioned to replacement contracts; and the redundancies and inefficiencies inherent in trying to obtain a different short-term bridge contract in order to have time to finish obtaining long-term replacement contracts.
If you have any questions regarding this award, please contact Glanville V. Industrious, AAQ-420 Phone: 202-493-5687 Email: glanville.v.industrious@faa.gov or Katherine M. Williams, AAQ-420 Phone: 202-267-3669 Email: katherine.m.williams@faa.gov no later than 11:00 am on July 17, 2013.

<DESC>Consolidated Information Technology and Cyber Security Support Services for the NNSA Office of the Chief Information Officer
THIS POSTING IS A SET OF DRAFT PERFORMANCE-BASED WORK STATEMENTS. 
BIDS, QUOTES, AND PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AND WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  
COMMENTS ARE REQUESTED ON THE DRAFT DOCUMENTS FROM INTERESTED SCHEDULE 70, SIN 132-51 HOLDERS ONLY.
NNSA anticipates awarding a set of Small Business Set-Aside Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for support services for the NNSA Office of the Chief Information Officer.  The anticipated Schedule is Schedule 70 - General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services.  The anticipated SIN is 132 51 - Information Technology Professional Services.  The anticipated NAICS code is 541513 - Computer Facilities Management Services, with a small business size standard of $25.5 million.
NNSA seeks comments from interested vendors holding active GSA Schedule 70 contracts covering SIN 132-51 on the draft performance-based scopes of work.  Comments shall be submitted via FedConnect; submission of comments via any other method than via FedConnect is not authorized.  Comments shall be received in FedConnect by 08:00am, Eastern Time, Monday, July 29, 2013.  Comments will not be directly addressed on an individual basis, but may be taken into account during the acquisition process.  Comments therefore should be directly and thoughtfully related to the scope of work.
Documents attached are the DRAFT Scope of Work for the Master BPA, and two separate DRAFT Performance-based Work Statements (PWSs) for potential Orders to be issued under the BPA.  The Government anticipates issuing the Consolidated IT Support scope of work under the BPA as a fixed price order, and the Consolidated Cyber Support scope of work under the BPA as a labor hour order.  Comments are requested on all three documents in all areas.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for a single spool turbine facility torquemeter. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Torquemeters ltd for a six (6) month period of performance. There are several reasons as to why this product is to be purchased through one source. NASA has a requirement for operation of several classes of turbines in W-6 with different torque ratings from 2,500 lbft. to 10,000 lbft. In order to have the most accurate measurement possible, an interchangeable shaft is necessary to optimally have the twist of the shaft rated for the amount of torque being measured. Torquemeters, Ltd. is the only company which manufactures torquemeters with interchangeable shafts. The torquemeter must measure torque through phase displacement measurements, which removes the electronics from the rotating shaft and positions them in a stationary casing of the torquemeter. There can be no shaft strain gage susceptibility to vibration influence of the torque measurement. It appears that Torquemeters, Ltd. is the only company which manufactures torquemeters using this principle. The torquemeter must have the capability of zero torque datum adjustments which eliminates the no load residual torque variation with speed. This correction must also be input into the torquemeter readout. Shaft couplings must utilize reversed moment diaphragms. This is needed to reduce the overhung weight on the bearings and provide a drive line design which is optimized for low vibrations. Couplings must also have integrated failsafe teeth which will engage if the couplings us being over-torqued which is needed to protect the diaphragms from damage. They must also engage if the diaphragms fail which is needed for safety to prevent over-speed and failure of the turbine. The proposed product must also interface with other components currently utilized at NASA GRC. The prospect of wireless telemetry was considered in lieu of wired instrumentation. However, the W-6 must use wired instrumentation for this torquemeter. It should also be noted that this will be a new shaft design so it will be designed with a bore for the wires. This is being incorporated from the beginning of the design. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 29 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	 .

<DESC>This synopsis supersedes the synopsis entitled "Program Analysis and Control (PAAC) III NNG09DA02C" which was posted on May 16, 2013. NASA's GSFC intends to award a Bridge Contract for the Program Analysis and Control (PAAC) III Contract for the Flight Projects Directorate to ASRC Research & Technology Solutions (ARTS) on a sole source basis, due to the fact that the current PAAC III contract is meeting its ceiling much earlier than originally anticipated. The Bridge Contract would ensure continuing performance of mission-critical support currently provided through task orders issued under the PAAC III contract, until the competitive follow-on contract can be awarded. Awarding a Bridge contract to ARTS will avoid unnecessary duplication of effort as competition for a follow-on contract (PAAC IV) is underway. ARTS, as the current incumbent, is the only responsible source qualified to perform this requirement due to its current performance of tasks related to numerous complex NASA flight programs such as Global Precipitation Measurement, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, and Joint Polar Satellite System. The estimated non-competitive value of this bridge contract is $46,000,000. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) Only One Responsible Source. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort, in writing, to the identified point of contact, not later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard time on July 22, 2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is requesting submissions to pre-qualify firms for services for the construction of fit out and finish work to complete the Diplomatic facilities contained in a newly constructed NATO Headquarters facility in Brussels, Belgium. The project will consist of the construction of secure diplomatic facilities to house U.S. Diplomatic functions.
<p>1. Project Description (Secret Facility and Personnel Security Clearances Required)<br />SAQMMA-13-R0430, Brussels, Belgium, Finish Work Construction to Fit-out Diplomatic Mission Space in Newly Constructed NATO Headquarters Facility.<br />NATO is constructing a new headquarters in Brussels, adjacent to the current headquarters site on Boulevard L&eacute;opold III. NATO will complete the shell and core of the base building, turning over the unfinished floors to the U.S. for interior fit-out in August 2014. Fit-out construction must be complete by December 2015.</p>
<p>The fit-out for the U.S. Mission and Military Delegation will include 4 &frac12; floors of a building wing consisting of 9,000 GSM (5,176 NSM). The project consists of all the work needed to prepare the space for use as diplomatic facilities for over 200 full-time employees. This will include construction of raised floor and demountable partition systems; mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and telecommunication infrastructure connected to base-building systems; technical and physical security. The project is planned to achieve LEED Silver certification. <br />Approximate construction cost: $50 - $75 Million.</p>
<p>2. Project Solicitation<br />The project solicitation will consist of two phases.<br /><br />Phase I - Pre-Qualification of Offerors<br />This announcement of solicitation of pre-qualification submissions is Phase I. DOS will evaluate and rate the pre-qualification submissions based on the procedure and evaluation criteria set forth below. <br /><br />The Government may conduct an information session for interested Offerors prior to the receipt of pre-qualification submissions. A separate announcement will be issued on the Federal Business Opportunities webpage (www.FBO.gov) to specify the location, date, and time.</p>
<p>Phase II - Requests for Proposals from Pre-Qualified Offerors<br />Those Offerors determined to be pre-qualified in accordance with this notice will be issued a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for the project and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II. The RFP will include a statement of work, standards, and criteria for the project that set out the project scope, construction process, post-construction activities, reference drawings and specifications, codes and standards, and security requirements.<br /><br />Firms submitting proposals in Phase II may be required to make oral presentations to DOS. Offerors may be invited to present their project approach and Technical Submission in response to this RFP in person at the offices of OBO in Rosslyn, VA in an interview following the proposal submission date. Interview times and details will be published by the Contracting Officer at least 2 weeks prior to the first interview. The presentation should emphasize the notable aspects of the offeror's written technical proposal. Offerors are cautioned: DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PRICE INFORMATION IN THE PRESENTATION.</p>
<p>The contract will be "firm fixed-price." Construction services will include providing construction labor and materials to execute the OBO-accepted design; on-site organization with management to ensure overall project coordination; and overall control throughout the life of the project. Required services include preparation of construction documents, quality control plans, safety plans, project schedules, cost estimates, and project close-out activities.</p>
<p>Firms submitting information for Phase I qualification shall address the following criteria in the proposal.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, DOS anticipates that the pre-qualified Offerors from Phase I will be required to participate in visits to the project site within 30 days after the issuance of the Phase II RFP.</p>
<p>3. Prior Pre-Qualification of Certain Offerors - NOT APPLICABLE<br />This solicitation requires a complete prequalification package submission.</p>
<p>4. SUBMISION REQUIREMENTS AND CONTENT:</p>
<p>4.A. Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. Firms being considered for award under this acquisition are limited to "United States Person" bidders as defined in the Act. The Offeror must complete and submit as part of its pre-qualification package the pamphlet "Certifications Relevant to Public Law 99-399, Statement of Qualifications for Purpose of Section 402 of The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986." (The pamphlet is attached to this FEDBIZOPPS announcement and may be obtained from the DOS Contract Specialist listed at the end of this notice.) If a Joint Venture (JV) is formed, the company having 51 percent or greater interest in the JV must be the one completing the pamphlet. This is a pass/fail evaluated area. Submissions from Offerors who do not receive a pass rating in this area will not be further evaluated. The Department intends to evaluate only the information submitted with the Certifications pamphlet, but reserves the right to request an offeror to submit additional information to correct or explain information submitted with the Certifications pamphlet.</p>
<p>To demonstrate performance of similar construction work for Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 purposes, the offeror needs to provide information demonstrating that it has successfully completed in the United States or at a U.S. diplomatic or consular mission a construction contract or subcontract involving work of the same general type and complexity as the solicited project and having a contract or subcontract value of at least $35 million.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Organizations that wish to use the experience or financial resources of any other legally dependent organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or other related firms, must do so by way of a joint venture. A prospective offeror may be an individual organization or firm, a formal joint venture (where the arrangement among the co-venturers has been reduced to writing), or "de facto" joint venture (where no formal agreement has been reached, but the offering entity relies upon the experience of a related U.S. person firm that guarantees performance). To be considered a "qualified United States joint venture person," every joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. person listed in Section 402. The U.S. person co-venturer will be required to sign a guarantee making the U.S person individually responsible for performance of any contract awarded, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.</p>
<p>4.B. Security Clearance Requirement. In order to be eligible to perform under this contract, the pre-qualified firm(s), including all entities which comprise a JV and the JV itself, must possess or be able to obtain a Defense Security Service (DSS) Secret facility security clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. Specifically designated personnel requiring access to classified information or to the Controlled Access Areas (CAAs) must possess a Secret personnel security clearance issued by DSS. Offerors already possessing the necessary FCL must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, facility clearance and safeguarding level with the required pre-qualification documentation.</p>
<p>If an otherwise pre-qualified Offeror does not possess the necessary FCL, DOS will sponsor the firm for an FCL at the time the Offeror is determined to be pre-qualified. DOS will allow 90 calendar days from the notice of pre-qualification for firms to obtain the necessary FCL. Firms will not receive the classified portions of the Phase II RFP until they have been issued the appropriate FCL and received Defense Security Service (DSS) approval to safeguard classified documents. DOS sponsorship does not guarantee that the Offeror will receive the FCL, or that it will be received within the 90-day period. The Government will not be obligated to extend its solicitation schedule, or to make an award to a sponsored, pre-qualified firm, if that firm has not been issued a FCL.</p>
<p>NOTICE: The offeror selected for contract award must possess or obtain an Information System (IS) or standalone computer, approved by DSS, for processing classified information. Performance on this contract will require access to the Department's ProjNet-C, for receipt and transmission of all classified information, and a DSS approved classified IS for processing classified information.</p>
<p>5. Closing Deadline for Submissions<br />ALL SUBMISSIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 3:00 P.M. Eastern Time on August 01, 2013.<br />TRANSMISSION OF PROPOSALS: Offerors shall hand deliver or submit proposals by courier (FedEx, UPS Express Mail, DHL, ETC.) to the following address: <br />U.S. Department of State<br />Jillian Savage/Michael Howard<br />A/LM/AQM/FDCD/AEB, 4th Floor<br />1735 North Lynn Street <br />Arlington, VA 22209</p>

<p>U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)<br />Office of Administration<br />Division of Contracts<br />11545 Rockville Pike<br />Rockville, MD 20852-2738<br />United States</p>
<p>Title: <br />Technical Assistance Activities Related to New Reactor License Applications (US-APWR)) <br />Contract Award Date: TBD</p>
<p><br />The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Information Systems Laboratories, Inc. (ISL) to obtain continued support for the New Reactors Applications Reviews (US-APWR). The current contract for Technical Assistance Activities Related to New Reactor License Applications (US-APWR) with ISL is NRC-42-08-064, ADAMS Assession number ML 082810322. The period of performance for the follow-on of technical services support is five (5) years. The authority for negotiating on a sole-source basis with ISL is made under the authority of 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(b)(1), which provides for limiting in those situation where the services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of service will satisfy the agency's requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 (Size Standard: $14 Million). This action is for technical assistance services relating to the new license applications for MHI US-APWR. ISL possesses unique experience and expertise on this specific design center and familiarity with the application reviews under those designs over the past four years, combined with their integral role assisting in the entire review process up to preparation of Safety Evaluation Reports qualifies those organizations as the only contractors that can complete reviews related to the various design centers in a time-efficient manner. An award to any other commercial entity would result in duplication of cost to the NRC that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Further, the current scope of work creates an environment where potential bidders with little or no NRC licensing experience would further delay project schedules. This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the above address not later than 15 calendar days from the date this announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities. Telephonic responses and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered. Inquiries regarding this announcement may be made to Wanda M Brown. Contract Specialist by phone at (301) 287-3733 or via e-mail at wanda.brown@nrc.gov or Don King, Contracting Officer at (301) 287-0925 or via e-mail at donald.king@nrc.gov.</p>

<DESC>Project Description: <br> The Canaveral lock was constructed in 1951 with timber approach guide walls extending approximately 600 feet from both the East and West side of the monolith lock structure. The approach timber guide walls were previously repaired in 1979, but the environmental deterioration has created some timber piles in a state of failure. This makes the deteriorated portions of the approach walls unsuitable to resist the required mooring or impact loads.  <br> Project scope is to provide a repair for the Canaveral Lock East and West timber approach walls to prevent failure and restore the walls to an operational condition. New fiberglass/concrete composite marine pilings shall be installed to replace the existing piles. Fiber-reinforced plastic <br> fenders and structural plastic framing will be removed and either replaced or reinstalled as detail in the contract drawings. Member connections shall use stainless hardware and all existing hardware shall be replaced with stainless steel. Existing creosote timber marine piles shall be removed at the mudline. All removed creosote timber bracing, marine piles, and fenders shall be disposed in an approved landfill. Work also includes the service of a dedicated manatee observer. Location: The work is located at the Canaveral Lock and Barge Canal, Canaveral Harbor, Brevard County, Florida along the eastern coastline of Florida. The Lock and Barge Canal work area can be accessed via Port Canaveral ocean entrance, Canaveral Barge Canal from the Intracoastal Waterway, and Interstate 95 and local connectors. The magnitude of construction for this project is estimated to be between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. THIS IS AN SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE PROCUREMENT.  The solicitation will be issued on or about 01 Aug 2013 with proposal due on or about 01 Sep 2013.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is issuing a solicitation for a one-year sustainment contract to procure Special Operations Forces Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) hard armor ballistic inserts. The Government intends to award a one year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) production contract(s) for a fully developed item to the offeror(s) with the best value to the Government. This is not a R&amp;D contract; the offeror must be the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and submit data demonstrating conformance to all of the requirements in the Performance Specification and those set forth in the Berry Amendment. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 339999.
<p>The program will use full and open competition to fulfill the SPEAR hard armor ballistic insert requirement. The solicitation is tentatively scheduled for release in July 2013. The minimum contract value shall be $100,000.00 and the maximum contract value shall be $6,000,000.00. The minimum and maximum may be derived from any combination of the hard armor components identified by the Government. The Government reserves the right to award multiple contracts.</p>
<p>Only those offers with a U.S. verifiable production line that are the OEM shall be considered by the agency. The required ballistic plates must fully pass both SPEAR and DOT&amp;E First Article Testing (FAT) requirements prior to contract award and at no expense to the Government. To be considered for award, all proposed plate technologies/configurations must have been previously ballistically tested (both conditioned and unconditioned) in accordance with the SPEAR and DOT&amp;E FAT requirements outlined in the solicitation. <br /><br />A small business subcontracting plan is required for all offerors that do not meet the small business size standards under NAICS code 339999. To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Offerors may obtain information on SAM at www.sam.gov.</p>

OCICB strives to enhance institute capabilities in clinical informatics and bioinformatics, increase support for international research endeavors, improve management oversight and communications, and provide effective and reliable customer support.</p>
<p>In 2014, the NIAID will move approximately 2,200 workers to a new 491,000 square foot building on Fishers lane in Rockville, Maryland under a lease signed by the U.S. General Services Administration. The new facility is slated to be in full service the last quarter of calendar year (CY) 2014.

<p>The Contractor shall be expected to have experience and expertise to carry out a project of this size, scope, and complexity, and must be able to begin work approximately mid-August 2013.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Western Environmental Technology Laboratories Inc for an AC-S In-Situ Spectrophotometer, Cycle P04 Phosphate Sensor, and related accessories for the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) in Ann Arbor, MI.
<p><br />The NAICS code for this action is 334516.</p>
<p>AC-S In-Situ Spectrophotometer<br />The AC-S In-Situ Spectrophotometer is an optical instrument used in marine sciences that measures physical properties of light, such as absorption and attenuation of light in the photic zone, the upper section of a body of water through which light penetrates. The chosen instrument is the accepted international standard for measurement of light properties and behavior, specifically in the research community working in marine remote sensing.</p>
<p>The ACS in situ Spectrophotometer will allow GLERL investigators to collect inherent optical property (IOP) data from the Great Lakes. The instrument is pivotal in measuring properties of light that will result in fully understanding the optical properties of Case-2 waters in the lakes. This understanding is critical to production of regional optical satellite algorithms that provide wide spatial observation of the Great Lakes' pigment and turbidity characteristics. Future requirements of the instrument include light calibration, performed yearly, by Wet Labs, Inc. staff.</p>
<p>The Wet Labs, Inc. AC-S In-Situ Spectrophotometer is the industry standard absorption and attenuation measurement instrument, it is highly refined and has extensive legacy use in the marine optics community. It has the highest performance and best price for instruments in this category with this level of functionality. There are no other known sources that produce instruments of this nature.</p>
<p>If GLERL were not able to procure the AC-S In-Situ Spectophotometer, project goals of providing an early warning system for water intake and beach managers will be impacted. The AC-S In-Situ Spectophotometer measures spectral absorption and beam attenuation and is part of an observation system used to measure the inherent optical parameters of the waters of Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay. These measurements are critical in validating satellite measurements used in the detection of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Algal blooms can negatively impact water processing at municipal water plants resulting in an increase in carcinogenic compounds and taste and odor issues for drinking water. Some blue-green HABs contain toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Cycle P04 Phosphate Sensor<br />The Cycle P04 Phosphate Sensor is a wet chemistry based sensor that calculates an output in either uM or mg/L of phosphorus from In-Situ samples. It has onboard batteries and reagents in one package for long term deployments. It has a deployment life of over 3 months and stores the data onboard the instrument. GLERL has 2 of these instruments currently deployed in Western Lake Erie and have had very good success with the results. The deployment of this instrument will help in the understanding of Total Phosphorus levels in Western Lake Erie.</p>
<p>GLERL requires a wet chemistry based sensor that can take In-Situ measurements of phosphorus for long term moored autonomous deployments in the Great Lakes. The scope of the work is looking at phosphorus load in Western Lake Erie. The use of a sensor that can provide the accuracy of wet chemistry based results and be moored for the long term is very beneficial to this research. This sensor is unique in its ability to use bench top chemistry analyses to calculate PO4 levels as well as store the data in a moored environment for long term experiments. It is capable of reading nanomolar resolution in low PO4 environments as well. There is no other known sources who can provide a wet chemistry based In-Situ phosphate sensor for long term mooring use.</p>
<p>If GLERL were not able to procure the Cycle P04 Phosphate Sensor, project goals of providing an early warning system for water intake and beach managers will be impacted. The Cycle P04 Phosphate Sensor measures the amount of phosphate in the water column. This observation is used to understand how HABs are initiated and sustained in Saginaw Bay and Lake Erie leading to the construction of forecast models. Algal blooms can negatively impact water processing at municipal water plants resulting in an increase in carcinogenic compounds and taste and odor issues for drinking water. Some blue-green HABs contain toxic compounds.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the equipment submit substantiating documentation in writing within ten days of this notice. Responses can be faxed to Shelley Smith at 757-664-3633 or sent via e-mail to shelley.smith@noaa.gov. Documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans
Staffing Support for Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF)
February 14, 2013

PART I:

A.	PURPOSE

This notification is to identify Small Business Entites that are interested in providing services described in this notification.  It is the desire of the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide maximum opportunity to Small Disabled Veteran Owned/Veteran Owned Small business.  In keeping with that desire, it is imperative that perspective SDVOSB/VOSB vendors reply to this notification. Please include your NAICS code in your response.


B.	OVERVIEW.

The SSVF program's purpose is to provide supportive services grants to private non-profit organizations and consumer cooperatives to coordinate or provide supportive services to very low income Veteran families. Two critical foci of SSVF include:  A) the provision of homelessness prevention assistance to assist those at imminent risk for homelessness to maintain their housing, and B) the provision of rapid re-housing assistance for those who are homeless or exiting temporary or transitional housing to quickly reconnect to permanent housing.  Within SSVF, service provision is designed to be flexible and tailored to meet the immediate needs of the Veteran and his or her family members; regardless, services must include case management.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans (heretofore referred to as the National Center) is seeking a Contractor to provide staffing assistance and support needed to assist VA staff  in conducting on-site monitoring visits of SSVF grantees to assess their performance and compliance with program regulations, the relevant Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA), and signed grant services agreement between the grantee and the VA.  Grantees are required to assist eligible homeless Veterans and Veterans at-risk for homelessness through the delivery of a variety of services. 

To assess compliance with SSVF requirements Contractor will:

1.	Conduct on-site monitoring visits of designated SSVF grantees based on the attached Uniform Monitoring Plan (UMP). 
2.	Meet twice weekly with SSVF staff to coordinate site visit plans and coordinate monitoring efforts.
3.	Report twice monthly on completed visits and plans for scheduled visits
4.	Complete UMP report for each site visit within 2 weeks after site visit.
5.	Develop recommendations for improvements based on national trends and themes identified in facility surveys. National report should be completed within 60 days of final year 1 site visit.

 





PART II:
REQUIRMENTS

A.	TASKS AND ASSOCIATED DELIVERABLES.

Successful monitoring depends both on effective use of time and knowledgeable reviewers.  Contractor must have experience working with rapid re-housing and prevention initiatives at a national level.  Experience must be comprehensive, including all aspects of either program design and/or operations.  For purposes of the SSVF Program, monitoring visits must be carefully planned and require pre-monitoring preparation strategies that include:  

1)	Individual Monitoring Strategy.  Monitoring is conducted through a combination of remote preparation and document reviews and on-site review and interviews. The development of an individual, written monitoring strategy is needed to define the scope 	and focus the monitoring efforts.  It identifies:  

a.	the programs/areas/functions to be reviewed;
b.	data or information to be submitted by the grantee prior to monitoring (if any);
c.	the names of any participant staff members who will need to be consulted during 	the monitoring;
d.	anticipated staff who will conduct the monitoring;
e.	clearly defined areas of responsibilities for each reviewer (to avoid duplication) if more than one staff person will be conducting the monitoring;
f.	a schedule for carrying out the monitoring tasks and the anticipated time frames; 	
g.	The individual monitoring strategy (IMS) should take place prior to beginning the monitoring. Timely and concise written documentation is an important tool for management use in assessing planned actions against accomplishments;
h.	IMS must be approved by the program office prior to conducting the monitoring visit.

2)	Pre-Monitoring Preparation.  Reviewers are responsible for being thoroughly familiar with VA Homeless Prevention initiatives, specifically the SSVF Program, and for being knowledgeable of the entity or entities to be monitored. Such comprehension is crucial for making the most of scarce time and resources and effectively determining compliance and accomplishments, especially given program complexities.  It also enables the reviewer to make observations, provide or connect the grantee to technical assistance opportunities, or develop recommendations to improve program performance.

<DESC>ACC TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION EXCHANGE EVENTS<br /><br />In the full spirit of OSD's Better Buying Power 2.0 initiatives, the Air Combat Command (HQ ACC), as the primary provider of air combat forces to America's warfighting commanders, intends to reinstate its Technology Information Exchange (TIE) initiative. These TIEs are designed to bring industry representatives together with HQ ACC senior leaders to generate and sustain an ongoing dialogue on emerging technologies relevant to our combat airpower missions to include fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, battle management and electronic combat domains. To be clear, invited organizations participating in TIEs do not receive any financial reimbursement from ACC or the Air Force. Each TIE session, hosted by a HQ ACC General Officer or civilian equivalent, evolves from a distinct presentation intended to facilitate executive-level discussion between ACC &amp; Industry, with particular combat airpower technology focus on corporate independent research and development (IR&amp;D) projects. With the potential for mutual benefit for both ACC &amp; industry, HQ ACC's intent afford Industry the opportunity to add clarity to their understanding of combat air forces capability needs, gaps and influence to enable more focused IR&amp;D programs (without any financial reimbursement) in near, mid-, and far term corporate investment IR&amp;D commitments. In these sets of TIE dialogues, ACC is also committed to safeguarding corporate proprietary information, and intellectual property, in accordance with FAR 3.104 and other regulations. ACC has long supported the AF IR&amp;D Program office's initiatives, as executed from AFRL/XPP at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, to reinvigorate the dialogue with Industry to raise awareness of the exceptional technology work done in the Industrial base - this TIE initiative complements that IR&amp;D portfolios. We will continue to partner with them in these endeavors.<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201 (b). THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. This is not a request for contractual offers. RFIs are used to gather information from industry without any promise of a current or future contract or requirement. Information provided cannot be used to create a binding contract. Respondents to the RFI will not be reimbursed for the information provided to HQ ACC. This is a request for information from companies currently conducting IR&amp;D in relevant areas; not a request for companies that may be able to conduct research. Only those companies with demonstrated success in addressing Department of Defense (DoD) capability development in their IR&amp;D programs should consider responding to this RFI.<br /><br />Using the point of contact information listed below, please e-mail the two following items: (1) brief description and depth of your organization's IR&amp;D program (use Arial font 12, no more than two pages) (2) and point(s) of contact for further coordination if necessary. Questions on the format for deliverables above, please contact the TIE Coordinator listed below. All responses are due no later than, close of business, 26 July 2013. <br />HQ ACC will use the responses to determine what emerging technologies are available in the marketplace. The ACC team then intends to invite submitters of key IR&amp;D initiatives germane to the combat airpower capabilities and mutually seek ways of implementing IR&amp;D technologies into warfighting needs. <br />Point of Contact:<br />ACC's Strategy and Planning Branch (A5/8XX) at DSN 574-4586, Commercial 757-764-4586 or email, ACC.A5.8XX@langley.af.mil.<br />TIE Coordinator: Capt Juan C De Alba Ascencio

<a href="mailto:elizabeth.s.cardenas@us.army.mil">Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC)</a>
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO EXERCISE THE OPTION UNDER FAR CLAUSE 52.217-8, OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES. <br> The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) Acquisition Center on behalf of the SDDC 834th US Army Transportation Battalion (834th Trans Bn), Concord, California, intends to award a logical follow-on in the interest of economy and efficiency to an original order placed against the Stevedoring & Related Terminal Services (S&RTS) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract pursuant to FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services.  The current contract is scheduled to expire on 6 August 2013.  The contract will be extended for six (6) months for a period of performance from 7 August 2013 through 6 February 2014 to allow sufficient time to solicit a follow-on requirement.  This extension will provide for continuation of uninterrupted services to 834th Trans Bn.  The current contract with Ports America, Marine Terminals Corporation, covers S&RTS requirements for handling of Department of Defense (DoD) sponsored export and import cargo for the SDDC 834th Trans Bn to include vessel loading, vessel discharging, receipt of cargo, disposition of cargo, stuffing/unstuffing of cargo, intra-terminal transfer of cargo and onward movement of cargo and management expertise at operational areas of Ports of Concord, Oakland, Naval Station Ventura County (Port Hueneme), and San Diego, California. <br> A sole source modification is consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This notice is being posted because the option, under FAR 52.217-8, was not previously evaluated as part of initial task order award.  This optional provision will be at the current rates specified in the current order, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8, and will extend performance.  This option exercise will further allow for solicitation, evaluation, and award of a competitive follow-on procurement.  The incumbent contractor is the only responsible offeror for this option as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements if this optional provision is not executed before the current order expiration date of 6 August 2013.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 488320 with a size standard of $35.5M. <br> This notice is not a request for proposals.  Telephone inquiries will not be entertained.  However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received within 15 days of this posting.  Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement in the timeframe required.  Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be emailed to the attention of Elizabeth Cardenas at Elizabeth.S.Cardenas.civ@mail.mil.  All information received from this notice shall be used for planning and market research purposes only.  The determination to refrain from competing this proposed contract action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted or use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the evaluation of the information received.   <br>

<p>Synopsis: <br />The Advanced Network Technologies Division (ANTD) in the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducts research and development in networking measurement and modeling technologies, and standards development for network protocols. ANTD is developing performance analysis and network modeling tools to better understand technologies that enable reliable communications between various entities in the electric grid and to better understand the performance, suitability, interoperability, and security of existing communication technologies. ANTD is identifying technical issues and performance gaps with existing communication technologies and how well they support different smart grid applications and scenarios.</p>
<p>NIST requires a Contractor to support ANTD's activities in order to develop and validate algorithms for optimal placement of electricity storage devices in the electrical distribution network, develop system-level modeling and simulation to examine interactions between the electrical generation/distribution network and the communications network, and develop models to quantify element failures in smart grid and develop protection and restoration schemes to mitigate their effects.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide scientific and technical services consisting of the following:</p>
<p>1. Conduct modeling and simulation efforts to develop and validate algorithms for determining optimal placement of electricity storage devices in the electrical distribution network.<br />2. Develop and test a co-simulation framework for examining interactions between the electrical generation/distribution network and the communications network.<br />3. Model element failures that may occur in the electrical distribution network, the communications network, as well as correlated failures that affect both networks, and apply protection and restoration strategies to mitigate their effects.<br />4. Document the tools and models that will be developed.</p>
<p>Deliverables shall be in the form of running code for the simulation models developed, documentation for algorithms, models, and tools developed, contents for publication and public dissemination, articles and papers contributed to Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) Priority Action Plans (PAP) related to networking, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 802 working group, the Internet Engineering Task force (IETF), and professional conferences/ journals on the topic.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 541690, with size standard of $14M. NIST anticipates awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Prometheus Computing LLC for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition.

<SUBJECT>Modification to Extend Period of Performance of Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP) Journal
<SOLNBR>NIHLM2013732SRE
<RESPDATE>051313
<CONTACT>Sheila R. Edmonds, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014966546, Email sheila.edmonds@nih.gov
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) to modify Contract HHSN276200800005C on a sole source basis. It is the NLM's intent to extend the period of performance and increase the contract dollar value for the current Brogan and Partners Advertising Consultancy Inc. contract which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2013. The intent is to extend the present period of performance up to six (6) months (July 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013). The initial award was competed on FBO under NAICS Code 511120 Periodical Publishers. This is a commercial firm-fixed price contract to provide website and publishing services to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to publish the monthly scientific journal Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP).
<p><br />The Government intends to negotiate with the incumbent Contractor, Brogan and Partners Advertising Consultancy Inc., on a sole-source basis. This extension will permit the continuity of services on the current contract and allow an adequate amount of time to re-compete the requirement. Brogan &amp; Partners has the extensive experience necessary to continue meeting the goals and objectives of this contract during the period of re-competition. A new vendor will not be able to provide the required level of services to NIEHS without significant preparatory activities. The incumbent Contractor possesses the immediate institutional knowledge required to continue day-to-day operations of EHP until the contract is successfully re-competed. A different vendor will not be able to provide the required level of performance in the short time required for this extension (0-6 months) without a significant increase in costs and an extended learning curve which could result in a delay in production or disruption of services. By utilizing the incumbent Contractor during this contract extension period, EHP would be able to continue day-to-day operation without unacceptable delay in fulfilling the monthly mission of producing a quality journal of scientific research and news for the world. Also no additional costs would be incurred by NIEHS due to project delays. Therefore, Brogan and Partners is the only Contractor capable of providing comprehensive and uninterrupted services for the NIEHS' EHP in such a brief period of time.</p>
<p><br />This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor is a RFP available; however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the aforementioned modification. Responses must be in writing and must be received electronically at the Government infrastructure by 3:00 PM EST on Monday, May 13, 2013. Proposals must include pricing information and should reference Synopsis No. NIHLM2013732SRE and should be submitted to sheila.edmonds@nih.gov. Inquiries regarding this procurement shall be submitted electronically to sheila.edmonds@nih.gov and shall be received by 2:00 PM EST on Wednesday, May 8, 2013.</p>

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this solicitation will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>The contractor shall stamp or mark the supplies delivered or otherwise furnish notice with the supplies of the existence of a warranty.  Markings shall include (i) a brief statement that a warranty exists, (ii) the substance of the warranty, (iii) its duration, and (iv) who to notify if the supplies are found to be defective. <BR> <BR>

  (a) Definitions.  As used in this provision--
  "Economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) concern" means a small business concern that is at least 51 percent directly and unconditionally owned by, and the management and daily business operations of which are controlled by, one or more women who are citizens of the United States and who are economically disadvantaged in accordance with 13 CFR part 127. It automatically qualifies as a women-owned small business eligible under the WOSB Program.

An inverted domestic corporation as herein defined does not meet the definition of an inverted domestic corporation as defined by the Internal Revenue Code at 26 U.S.C. 7874.

  "Place of manufacture" means the place where an end product is assembled out of components, or otherwise made or processed from raw materials into the finished product that is to be provided to the Government.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR PART 13.106 for the requirement under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation number is 1120652 and this solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).<br />RESPONSE DATE: 07/22/2013
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-68 effective June 26, 2013.<br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; FSC Code is 6640. Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. Acquisition is unrestricted.<br />Contract Type: Commercial Item-Firm Fixed Price. <br />REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Background<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) and the Arkansas Regional Laboratory of the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), co-located in Jefferson, AR., requires one (1) tunable resistive pulse sensing (TPRS)-based particle analyzer for use in research. In particular, the system will be used to support nanotechnology needs to perform complete physicochemical characterization of nanomaterials in consumer products, including the determination of the nanomaterial average size, size distribution, zeta potential and concentration. Traditional particle sizing techniques such as electron microscopy and chromatography are labor intensive, and require expensive instrumentation and complex sample preparation, which are not suitable for field laboratories. Other popular techniques such as dynamic light scattering can give rise to erroneous results due to strong biases caused by larger particles. High-throughput, field-amendable and accurate characterization of nanomaterials can be accomplished with a system that is portable, and performs rapid and real-time size and charge analysis of nano- and micro-particles (e.g. viruses, bacteria and cells, liposomes, silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, gold, etc.) on a particle-by-particle basis.</p>
<p>General specifications<br />&bull; The components shall be newly manufactured units, not used, refurbished or previously used for demonstration.<br />&bull; The system shall include all shipping and handling charges to the place of performance (Jefferson, AR).<br />&bull; The system shall be delivered with all necessary supplies and accessories required for installation and start-up. <br />&bull; Installation and 2 days of on-site training covering the operation, calibration, and routine maintenance of the system components, sample preparation for analysis, and use of the software to operate the system and perform data analysis shall be provided by the contractor. <br />&bull; The vendor shall demonstrate, upon installation, that the system meets all performance specifications. The instrument will not be accepted until those performance specifications have been met.</p>
<p>System specifications<br />&bull; Shall operate on US standard 120V electric service.<br />&bull; The system shall be portable.<br />&bull; The system shall be composed of a non-optical nanopore-based instrument that uses tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) to perform precise physical characterization (e.g. size, zeta potential and concentration) of micro- and nano-particles.<br />&bull; The system shall possess a variable pressure module (VPM) that provides pressure and vacuum control of sample flow to complement the electrophoretic operation of the base instrument.<br />&bull; The system shall include a fluid cell that allows for the easy positioning of the nanopore and could be easily fitted to the base instrument. The fluid cell shall be fitted with silver chloride electrodes and allow for a minimum sample volume requirement of 40 &micro;L.<br />&bull; The system shall be capable of accurately and reliably measuring particle size and size distribution (in the 50 nm-10 &micro;m size range) of polydisperse samples in aqueous solutions.<br />&bull; The system shall be capable of rapidly and precisely measuring particle concentration of biological, organic and inorganic particles (in the 105 to 1012 particles/mL concentration range).<br />&bull; The system shall be capable of real-time monitoring and detection of aggregation, functionalization and particle-particle interaction events. <br />&bull; The system shall be capable of simultaneously determining particle size and zeta potential of particles on a particle-by-particle basis.</p>
<p>Software<br />&bull; The system shall be capable of instrument control and data analysis. Data analysis software shall allow for installation on at least two computers. <br />&bull; The system shall perform all functions without the requirement of internet access. <br />&bull; Contractor shall include coverage for software and firmware updates that can be installed without internet access.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Simplified Acquisition, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Optronic Laboratories, LLC using the procedures in FAR Parts 6 and 13. The NESDIS, STAR Division, part of NESDIS Division, has a requirement to purchase a Variable Integrating Sphere (OL 455-18). This Variable Integrating Sphere has already been calibrated with NIST. The current primary task of the Ocean Color field team is to provide quality validation measurements for the JPSS VIIRS ocean color sensor. Our profiling Satlantic Hyperpro optical instrument is the main instrument for these in-situ measurements. Accuracy and consistency in these ground truth measurements are critical for providing feedback on sensor and processing performance and continuity in the satellite climate data record. As part of maintaining the necessary quality in our validation measurement, we have inter-calibrated and validated our Hyperpro to the Marine Optical BOUY (MOBY) which is the vicarious calibration source or all ocean color sensors. To maintain this chain of accuracy we are purchasing the same calibration source used by the MOBY Team to calibrate our radiance sensor on the Hyperpro which is the Optronics OL 455-18 Variable Integrating Sphere Calibration Standard. This calibration standard will also be NIST traceable.
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334516, 500 business size. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Responses must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other information that demonstrates that the quote meets all of the foregoing requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Amy.Sanderswhite@noaa.gov by July 26, 2013, 10:00 a.m. local time. Award will be made using FAR 13, Simplified acquisition procedures, current through FAC 2005-68. The determination to compete or not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(End Addendum)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>A. Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of the quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>B. Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under FAR 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows:</p>
<p>1. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>2. Technical Qualification: An offer's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in SOW. Quotations that do not meet these requirements will be considered unacceptable and therefore under the evaluation process will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>3. Contractor address in writing as part of their quotation how they will support the required 24 hour replacement time frame for vehicle breakdowns. See "Breakdown/Accident Procedures" in the SOW.</p>
<p>4. Transition Plan: Contractor must provide the timeline from award with specific dates that vehicles will be in place.</p>
<p>AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose quotes are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability.<br />FAR 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990)<br />Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)<br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.

The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 14 Days.<br />FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)<br />(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.<br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.<br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 3.5 years.<br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (Apr 2012)<br />An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via https://www.acquisition.gov .

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one of the following:<br />Primary point of contact:<br />Contract Specialist: Zachariah Pinkston<br />TEL: 01638-52-2363 or EM: zachariah.pinkston@us.af.mil <br /><br />Alternate point of contact:<br />Contract Specialist: Justin Haynes<br />TEL: 01638-52-2344 or EM: justin.haynes@lakenheath.af.mil</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>A. Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of the quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>B. Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under FAR 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows:</p>
<p>1. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>2. Technical Qualification: An offer's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in SOW.

<p>4. Transition Plan: Contractor must provide the timeline from award with specific dates that vehicles will be in place.</p>
<p>AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose quotes are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for award.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one of the following:<br />Primary point of contact:<br />Contract Specialist: Zachariah Pinkston<br />TEL: 01638-52-2363 or EM: zachariah.pinkston@us.af.mil <br /><br />Alternate point of contact:<br />Contract Specialist: Justin Haynes<br />TEL: 01638-52-2185 or EM: justin.haynes@lakenheath.af.mil</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. <br />If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the CCR database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.<br />(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.<br />(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]<br />(5) <br />(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may-<br />(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or<br />(B) Terminate this contract for cause.<br />(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract.<br />(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to--<br />(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or<br />(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.<br />(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract.<br />(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.<br />(9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.

If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation.

For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.<br />(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.<br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount computed under paragraph (i) Payments of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours expended in furnishing work not delivered to or accepted by the Government shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this clause, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.</p>

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:  Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:  Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to London.c.venzon@uscg.mil. For technical questions will be emailed to Nasaria.e.valadez@uscg.mil. Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 0800 Pacific Time on 22Jul13 2013.</p>

Statement of Work
Peer Support Certification Training
Office of Mental Health/ Employee Education System (EES)


1.	PURPOSE.   The purpose of this contract is to provide training and certification for non-certified peer support apprentices and peer support technicians.  VHA's Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Services Section in the Office of Mental Health Services (OMHS) have been charged with developing and approving peer support certification training services.  The Director of Peer Support Services for the Office of Mental Health Services is responsible for the program of peer support in VA's mental health programs.  

2.	BACKGROUND.  Peer support services were formally initiated in VHA mental health programs in 2006 with funding that enhanced mental health programs with recovery-oriented services, and a Director of Peer Support Services in OMHS was hired in 2007. Prior to the passage of Public Law 110-387 in October 2008, peers hired in VHA were not required to be certified to provide peer services. The passage of this law as well as Public Law 111-163 (passed in May 2010) not only required that peer support specialists in VHA be certified by an appropriate peer certification program but also provided authorization for VHA to develop a national contract with a not-for-profit agency to provide training for Veterans to provide peer support services. Peer support services are an essential component of transforming VHA's mental health programs to the recovery model and are required by VHA Handbook 1160.01, Uniform Mental Health Services in VA Medical Centers and Clinics.  A contract for this purpose is currently in force with the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, but expires due to need to expand the scope and have open competition for additional training. The current contract for 160 employees is VA741-13-C-0019. 

3.	Objectives.   The contractor shall provide VA employed peer support apprentices or technicians with training and certification. The training must result in employees being fully prepared to take and pass a certification examination administered by the award vendor. This training must cover the competencies and skills for peer support services in mental health programs as defined by OMHS and described in the Specific Tasks and Deliverables Section below.    

4.	Scope.  The Contractor shall provide the required labor and materials to develop and present a peer support specialist training and certification program for VA employees nationwide,. Classes will be up to 20 students per class and for a total of 18 classes per year. Contractors shall follow the existing quality control plan that contains, at a minimum, a description of the inspection system to cover all services including areas to be inspected and the schedule of inspection, a description of the methods used for identifying and preventing defects in the quality of services and a description of the records to be kept to document inspections and any corrective/preventive actions taken in advance of the award of the contract.

Services: Peer support certification training, including didactic, experiential, and multimedia modalities, covering the 34 competencies that VHA has designated as required for peer support staff are identified in the Specific Tasks and Deliverables section below. Some competencies marked with an asterisk in the list of mandatory tasks must have an experiential component that includes role playing and provides for demonstration of those skills in order to establish competencies. 

Training for the competencies that do not require the face-to-face experiential modality may be provided through in-person training or through completion of workbook materials, manuals, or online learning conducted prior to the experiential training.  Attachment  (A) has been included which gives details of guidelines and expectations VHA will use to evaluate the responses to this proposal.  Attachment (E), VA Reviewer Rating Tool to Evaluate Peer Support Certification Training RFPs, is the actual tool the VA review team will use in evaluating submitted proposals.  Completion of Attachment (D) is recommended but optional, and may be submitted with required deliverables.

An examination that demonstrates mastery of the peer support competencies and skills must be administered by the contractor in two segments.  A performance based segment that demonstrates mastery of the competencies and skills learned in the face-to-face training (those marked below with an asterisk under "Task One") will be administered during the face-to-face training.  A second segment of the examination will be administered to measure the competencies and skills that do not require a face-to-face experiential modality after completion of the training or at a later time agreed upon and acceptable to VHA for administration at the student participant's home facility.. Peer support staff must pass the examination with a score determined by and agreeable to the vendor and OMHS.

5.	Specific Tasks and Deliverables.  If for any reason, any deliverable cannot be delivered on time according to the below schedule, the contractor shall provide a written explanation three days prior to the due date to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).  This written transmittal shall include a firm commitment of when the work shall be completed.  This transmittal to the COR shall cite reasons for the delay, and the impact on the overall project.

Unless otherwise specified an electronic copy shall be placed in the designated CBO SharePoint site or other CBO-designated site.  Specifically, the contractor shall:
5.1	Task One.  The contractor shall develop a plan for training to thoroughly cover the following 34 competencies.

Suggested instructions for VA Reviewers for completing sheet:

Review the Excel spreadsheet the agency completed and the materials that they submitted.  *Asterisked Items must have an experiential element and be taught during the face-to-face training.

Column 1 	Check if the competency is covered.  

Column 2 	The minimum amount of time that is barely adequate for training in all the competencies is 40 hours, but more is preferred.  In the column for adequate time is an estimated minimum number of hours that would barely cover that competency in parenthesis.  As total time increases, the time for each specific competency should be proportional to these guidelines.  Time element may include face-to-face, manual reading, on-line learning or computerized learning from CD or DVDs.  Proposals that are creative and combine a mix of face-to-face sessions with on-line and remote learning opportunities will receive higher preference.

Column 3 	Certain competencies (those asterisked) should have some role-playing opportunities during the training or internship.  If there is no opportunity noted in the agency's spread sheet, say N, otherwise Y.

Last Column	** Rate adequacy on a 10-point scale as follows: 1 = Inadequate (none or only cursory mention of competency area with no reinforcing learning opportunity); 5 = Mostly Adequate (dedicates section of training to competency area, but does not include reinforcing learning opportunity for those areas asterisked); 10 = Adequate (dedicates section of training to competency area and includes reinforcing learning opportunity for those areas asterisked).  Reinforcing learning includes experiential exercises, video viewing and/or embedded quizzing of material covered during training course.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This announcement is to post Government responses to Vendor questions received pertaining to the solicitation. Questions that were received by 1200mst 11 July 2013, would be answered by the Government,as required in Paragraph#4 of the solicitation. The Government received one question. <br> Vendor Question: <br> After reading the new solicitation and SOW, it looks as though the only item that has changed is the requirement of OM4 as opposed to the previous solicitation that included OM4-IP. <br>  <br> If that is indeed the only change, please confirm and we will re quote this. <br>  <br> Governments Response: <br>  <br> Your interpertation of the change is correct. The change was to add the OM-4 in order to remove/replace the OM4-IP. Technically, there was another change in the SOW that removed the site visit, no site visit will be offered during this solicitation. I believe your intent for this question though, was focused on just the change in part numbers for the Clin structure.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) TBD is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. <BR> <BR>1.  Technical Quotation: The offeror shall submit a technical quotation. The technical quotation shall address the following: Technical Capability: The offeror shall submit a technical description or product literature for the equipment it is proposing, which clearly identifies the manufacturer, make and model.  The offeror must demonstrate that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds each minimum requirement described in the statement of work by providing a citation to the relevant section of its technical description or product literature. 
2.  Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.  Please include contact information, to include phone number and email address, for all references. <BR> <BR>Bid Term:  vendors must provide manufacturer part number, name, and extended specifications for evaluation in order to be considered.
If the Offeror is not the manufacturer, evidence that the Offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to provide the item(s) in the quotation shall be included. <BR> <BR>Technical Capability: Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST?s requirements. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror?s past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.
Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness. 
Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor. <BR> <BR>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal to price. <BR> <BR>

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

Due to the highly corrosive environment and corrosion repairs being tracked, when manufacturing and replacing these aircraft parts it is a requirement of the United States Coast Guard to apply the best corrosion protection available to minimize the impact corrosion has on its airframes, while reducing the amount of Chromium used during this application.Current priming applications utilize spray equipment and large portions of chromium based primers which qualify to MIL-PRF-23377. These applications require extensive PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and exposure monitoring for chromium levels. This process has also proven impossible to provide the required uniform mil thickness to the three dimensional aircraft parts and components being manufactured and replaced on the USCG?s airframes. The current spray application also generates excessive waste while only utilizing roughly 30 - 35 percent of the actual material being applied, which equates to 65 - 70 percent wasted material and excessive cost incurred. Excessive dry times are also required for the current process with MIL-PRF-23377 primers taking from 2 - 8 hours to cure before the topcoat or assembly process can take place. SCOPE: The USCG Base Elizabeth City?s, Aviation Logistics Center?s objective is to obtain an Anodic Electro-Coating system capable of applying E-coat meeting the SAE AMS 3144 specification and coating material meeting this specification in the amount one complete system fill. Must be capable of coating parts up to 20x32x36. This system will be a standalone system to be installed at ALC and must include a minimum of 40 hours of operator training, product support for a minimum period of one year and a maintenance manual for the Electro-coat system. The system shall also include a light curtain barrier, and overhead I-beam trolley system. This is a new specification which has been written for use in the aerospace industry, and is a new requirement for ALC on all locally manufactured aircraft parts. The Electro-coat process is different from the typical spray process that is used today in the aerospace industry. It utilizes a tank process that dips parts and components after pretreatment and coats the parts with a chrome free corrosion inhibitive primer. This along with the absence of Chromium minimizes the requirements for PPE and eliminates the exposure monitoring required for the current process. The coating mil thickness is controlled and the process has the ability to coat 3D shaped parts with ease. Material utilization is 98% compared to standard spray primers of 30 - 35%. Also the parts can be handled immediately following application prior to oven cure of 30 minutes at 200F. Once this cure is complete these parts will be ready to continue their flow through the PDM (Programmed Depot Maintenance). <BR> <BR>REQUIREMENTS: Design: The Contractor shall provide a complete design, which is functional, technically accurate, fully detailed, and in conformance with applicable regulations. The Contractor shall perform thorough research and site investigation.  Investigation shall cover all site features that may be affected by the project design.  The Contractor will be held responsible for all costs incurred as a result of any design errors, deficiencies, or inadequacies resulting from the use of inaccurate drawings and/or insufficient research or site investigation.

<DESC>Tactical Biometric Device Technology Demonstration      <br>   Request for Information (RFI)       <br>   25 June 2013      <br>   Solicitation # W15P7T-13-R-A055      <br>           <br>   This Request for Information (RFI) is to assist Government in identifying organizations within industry and academia capable of delivering a Tactical Biometric Device that meets Department of Defense (DoD) requirements. This RFI is for planning purpose only. This is NOT a request for Quotations or Proposals. No solicitation document exists and formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI. The Government will not pay for any response expenses. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.      <br>       <br>   Background      <br>            <br>   A critical component to the DoD Biometrics Enterprise is the ability to collect biometric and contextual information in a tactical environment.  There are several ongoing efforts across DoD to make this technology an enduring capability to include US Special Operations Command's (USSOCOM's) Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE) Program of Record (POR), the US Navy's Identity Dominance System (IDS) POR, and the US Army's Joint Personnel Identification, version 2 (JPIv2) program.  USSOCOM's SSE is an approved POR that leverages Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and COTS software while the US Navy's IDS is an approved POR that leverages COTS hardware and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) software.  The US Army's JPIv2 program is still in development with a draft Capability Development Document (CDD) currently under review.       <br>            <br>   Over the past several years, industry has made significant strides to develop and refine biometric tactical collection devices for use in tactical environments.  Vendors have used Internal Research and Development (IR&D) funding as well as government investment to develop their commercial systems.  As demonstrated by the USSOCOM SSE and the US Navy IDS, these commercial systems provide a capability that meets their respective program requirements.      <br>            <br>   The requirement to develop and field tactical biometric collection devices has the potential to incur significant financial costs to the Department in a time of fiscal austerity.  Employing guidance in the  quote mark Better Buying Power 2.0: Continuing the Pursuit for Greater Efficiency and Productivity in Defense Spending quote mark  memorandum dated 13 Nov 2012, the ASD(R&E) is seeking to increase efficiencies and ensure affordability across the Biometrics Enterprise.  To better inform the Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for Biometrics, the Defense Biometrics and Forensics Office (DBFO), Joint Improvised Explosive Devices Defeat Organization (JIEDDO), and the U.S. Army's Program Manager for DoD Biometrics (PM DoD Biometrics) are pursuing an effort to understand how current COTS tactical handheld biometric collection devices perform against DoD's requirements.      <br>      <br>   Description      <br>         <br>   On behalf of the PSA for Biometrics, the Defense Biometrics and Forensics Office, JIEDDO, and PM DoD Biometrics the U.S. Army Communications-Electronic Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) will be conducting a measured demonstration to determine the effectiveness of COTS tactical biometric device collection devices perform against DoD's requirements.  A measured demonstration is defined as a technology demonstration that assesses the performance of a system against defined metrics, in a controlled environment, and with operational data.  I2WD is conducting this RFI to identify individuals or organizations within industry and academia that have developed a tactical biometric device and would like to participate in this measured demonstration.      <br>            <br>   The measured demonstration is on schedule to occur between July 29 and August 23, 2013.  This demonstration will include documentation review, source code review, hardware/software testing, functional/operational testing, and accuracy testing.  A detailed test plan will be revealed to industry and academia at an Industry Day to be held the week of July 15, 2013.  Test findings and analysis will be provided to the program sponsors.  Participants will ONLY receive findings and analysis pertaining to their submitted systems.  Figure 1 below shows a schedule of expected events and their associated tentative dates.      <br>            <br>   Event Tentative Date (2013)      <br>   Survey Released	  June 20      <br>   Project Kickoff	  June 12      <br>   RFI Released 	  June 20      <br>   RFI Responses Due  July 12      <br>   Receipt of Participant Hardware and Documentation	July 1 - July 26      <br>   Industry Day	July 15      <br>   Measured Demonstration	July 29 - August 23      <br>   Conduct Demonstration Analysis	July 31 - August 28      <br>   Analysis Report Distributed	August 30      <br>      <br>   This RFI requests industry and academia to provide information on their willingness to participate in this measured demonstration.  Participants must identify in their response by the type of tactical biometric devices along with quantities, associated software, documentation (ie user manuals, versions description, third party assessments or Laboratory Evaluations, design documents, system security documentation, source code, and training plans/materials that will be made available to I2WD for the measured demonstration. While lack of a particular resource in the aforementioned categories will not necessarily disqualify a participant, negative test results may be documented during the measured demonstration.  A cost breakout, to include licensing, peripherals, and recurring costs for the submitted Tactical Biometric Collection Device should also be included in the response.      <br>            <br>   Response      <br>            <br>   The Government is requesting industry and academia to provide the following information pertaining to this RFI:      <br>       	A statement of their willingness to participate in the Tactical Biometric Device Technology Demonstration      <br>       	Identification by type and quantity of the resources that will be made available to I2WD for a measure demonstration to include:      <br>      a.

[Are there any?]   <br>       <br>   A: No Test and Evaluation services in support of the Measured Demonstration Phase scheduled 29 July -23 August 2013 are required at this time for this demonstration.    <br>      <br>      <br>   Q: Has a location been determined for the 15 July Industry Day and will pre-registration be required for this event?   <br>      <br>   A:  The Industry Day for the OSD Tactical Biometric Device Technology Demonstration, not to be confused with other PM Biometric Lifecycle Management Industry Days, will be held on July 15, 2013 at MITRE (Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD) between 0800 and 1700.  Exact details will be provided to those who respond to this RFI.   <br>      <br>   Q: I would like to know if the RFI that was released yesterday under W15P7T13RA055 is related to [this similar requirement] that was released under W15QKN13R0013 (from ACC-New Jersey) through FBO for an EMD contract. Is this the same requirement and was transferred over to your office? Or are they nonrelated?   <br>      <br>   A: They are unrelated.   <br>      <br>   Q: Is there a tentative location for the 15 July 2013 Industry Day?   <br>      <br>   A: The Industry Day for the OSD Tactical Biometric Device Technology Demonstration, not to be confused with other PM Biometric Lifecycle Management Industry Days, will be held on July 15, 2013 at MITRE (Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD) between 0800 and 1700.  Exact details will be provided to those who respond to the RFI.      <br>      <br>   Q: Is the Government interested in multi-modal (e.g., fingerprint, face, and iris) or uni-modal (e.g., iris only) Tactical Biometric Collection Devices?  For instance, USSOCOM hosted a Tactical Biometrics Evaluation event in 2012 that evaluated only those commercial systems that provided a capability that met their program requirements of fingerprint, face, and iris multi-modal biometric collection.   <br>      <br>   A: Yes.  This technical evaluation will evaluate both multiple modalities and single modalities as currently required by the Department of Defense.  Priority is focused on devices used to collect and transmit fingerprints, face, and iris.  Products featuring additional modalities and functions will be noted for future evaluations and requirements.   <br>      <br>   Q: Is the Government interested in only COTS Tactical Biometric Collection Devices that are commercially available today, or can vendors offer advanced concept technology demonstrators/prototypes for evaluation?   <br>      <br>   A: Vendors are encouraged to submit prototypes and concept devices that meet and exceed minimum capability requirements.  However, if an advance system or a system under development is submitted for evaluation, the system will be evaluated using the same criteria as the commercially available system with no consideration for the innovative features that are not currently required or in consideration for features that needs to be matured.  If there are substantial numbers of systems submitted for evaluation, testing priority will be on the commercially available systems; i.e. the immature and prototype systems will be evaluated after the commercially available systems in case time does not permit testing all submitted devices.     <br>      <br>   Q: Is the Government interested only in collection devices, without enrollment and/or matching and/or data sharing capabilities?   <br>      <br>   A: The government is seeking to evaluate devices that are used to enroll, match, share, and display biometric results using standard protocols and formats.     <br>      <br>   Q: Will the Government schedule time for vendors to adequately train Government personnel on the use of the Tactical Biometric Collection Device, prior to the formal Measured Demonstrations?   <br>      <br>   A: Yes. It is expected that the government testers will receive instructions from each vendor for each device and have access to vendors SMEs before and during the testing.  The government testers may require access to people who can provide operational instructions for each device, but the assumption is that user manuals will be sufficient and access to SME will be via phone on an as needed bases.   <br>      <br>   Q: In assessing the performance of a Tactical Biometric Collection system against defined metrics in a controlled environment, will the Government be looking for device capabilities to support future identity operations with expanded technical capabilities of capturing biometrics at stand-off, with subjects on the move, and in unconstrained environments with non-cooperative subjects?   <br>      <br>   A: Yes.  The majority of the government evaluation will focus on cooperative biometric collection.  Some non-cooperative collection factors will be reviewed during the evaluation, but the evaluation team will not determine the weights of those factors.  Other identity biometric capabilities that go beyond the requirements will be annotated in a separate report in hopes of scheduling future evaluation and establishing relationships with vendors with other capabilities.    <br>      <br>   Q: Will a vendor's Tactical Biometric Collection Device offering have to be available for the entire period of Measured Demonstrations, from July 29 through August 23, 2013?   <br>      <br>   A: Yes.  However, if there is a need to make it available for a shorter duration; the government evaluation team will work to accommodate vendors' needs.   <br>      <br>   Q: Will vendors have the opportunity to address corrective actions/issues during the course of the Measured Demonstrations?   <br>      <br>   A: Yes.   <br>      <br>   Q: With Measured Demonstrations being conducted on Tactical Biometric Collection Devices, does that mean that FAR and FRR will not be evaluated since matching is not part of the Measured Demonstration plan?   <br>      <br>   A: No.  FAR and FRR is part of the current requirements.   <br>      <br>   Q: Will respondents to the RFI be provided with the Measured Demonstration  quote mark defined metrics quote mark  at the planned Industry Day?   <br>      <br>   A: The Vendors will be provided with the OBJECTIVES on metrics.    <br>      <br>   Q: Will the test findings and analysis provided to a vendor on submitted systems be permitted to be disclosed by that vendor for marketing purposes?    <br>      <br>   A: Yes.   <br>      <br>   Q: Details about industry day (time, location, format) on 15 July?   <br>      <br>   A: (See above)   <br>      <br>   Q: Details on  quote mark receipt of participant hardware and documentation quote mark     <br>      <br>   A: We anticipate receiving both Hardware/Software and documentation for each system submitted.  These will be documented and controlled for both accountability and quality control.   <br>      <br>   Q: What date is the hardware and documentation needed?   <br>      <br>   A: Hardware/Software and documentation are requested as soon as possible but no later than July 26.  If there is a valid reason the equipment can't be received by July 26, it is up to the government evaluation team to decide if Hardware/Software and documentation will be accepted beyond that date.   <br>      <br>   Q: Where should it be delivered, and to whose attention?   <br>      <br>   A: The delivery address for all devices is:   <br>      <br>   ATTN: Mr. Clinton Brown, Biometric Technology Demonstration   <br>   Building 6005, Combat Drive   <br>   Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005   <br>      <br>   Packages may be shipped using FedEX, UPS, or United State Postal Service.   <br>   Package should be mark as  quote mark unclassified quote mark  when appropriate on the outside.    <br>   If sending multiple packages, please number each package and list the total number of packages on each box (ex. Box 1 of 3, box 2 of 3, and box 3 of 3).    <br>   Please include the return address and POC information within the shipping container.    <br>      <br>   Q: Is there POC information to arrange loan of our devices?   <br>      <br>   A: The primary POC for loaned devices is Mr. Clinton Brown and the alternate POC is Mr. Jeffrey Kuderna.    <br>      <br>   Q: How many devices are needed?    <br>      <br>   A: We are requesting three devices, with the same configuration.   <br>      <br>   Q: Will we need to provide training on our device?  How many people need to be trained?  Training in what location?  Training on what date?   <br>      <br>   A: We do not anticipate the need for in person training.  We anticipate that the USER Manuals / USER Guides with on call or telephonic training will be adequate.   <br>      <br>   Q: Will the manufacturer need to be present during the  quote mark measured demonstration quote mark ?   <br>      <br>   A: No. However we will be requesting a POC/SME be available prior to and during the demonstration for questions.   <br>      <br>   Q:  Is the Government looking for only hand-held Tactical Biometric Collection Devices systems, or are systems that are man-portable or utilized in fixed site applications (e.g., portals) also of interest?   <br>      <br>   A:  The evaluation is not limited to handheld devices, but mobility is a factor.  Man-portable and vehicular devices will be accepted.  This evaluation will not include fixed site applications or portals because the government will not have the resources to host the application or equally analyze all devices on the portal.  However, if a device works with a unique application or a specific portal, the additional capabilities will be noted in a separate report in preparation for a future evaluation.    <br>      <br>  Q: Where/when will the industry day be held?  <br>    <br>  A: The Industry Day will be held at MITRE on the second floor on Monday 7/15 from 0800-1700 hours. The address is: Aberdeen Site, 209 Research Blvd., Suite 200, Aberdeen, MD 21001.       <br>

<DESC>Tactical Biometric Device Technology Demonstration       <br>    Request for Information (RFI)        <br>    25 June 2013       <br>    Solicitation # W15P7T-13-R-A055       <br>             <br>    This Request for Information (RFI) is to assist Government in identifying organizations within industry and academia capable of delivering a Tactical Biometric Device that meets Department of Defense (DoD) requirements. This RFI is for planning purpose only. This is NOT a request for Quotations or Proposals. No solicitation document exists and formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI. The Government will not pay for any response expenses. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.       <br>         <br>    Background       <br>              <br>    A critical component to the DoD Biometrics Enterprise is the ability to collect biometric and contextual information in a tactical environment.  There are several ongoing efforts across DoD to make this technology an enduring capability to include US Special Operations Command's (USSOCOM's) Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE) Program of Record (POR), the US Navy's Identity Dominance System (IDS) POR, and the US Army's Joint Personnel Identification, version 2 (JPIv2) program.  USSOCOM's SSE is an approved POR that leverages Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and COTS software while the US Navy's IDS is an approved POR that leverages COTS hardware and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) software.  The US Army's JPIv2 program is still in development with a draft Capability Development Document (CDD) currently under review.        <br>              <br>    Over the past several years, industry has made significant strides to develop and refine biometric tactical collection devices for use in tactical environments.  Vendors have used Internal Research and Development (IR&D) funding as well as government investment to develop their commercial systems.  As demonstrated by the USSOCOM SSE and the US Navy IDS, these commercial systems provide a capability that meets their respective program requirements.       <br>              <br>    The requirement to develop and field tactical biometric collection devices has the potential to incur significant financial costs to the Department in a time of fiscal austerity.  Employing guidance in the  quote mark Better Buying Power 2.0: Continuing the Pursuit for Greater Efficiency and Productivity in Defense Spending quote mark  memorandum dated 13 Nov 2012, the ASD(R&E) is seeking to increase efficiencies and ensure affordability across the Biometrics Enterprise.  To better inform the Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for Biometrics, the Defense Biometrics and Forensics Office (DBFO), Joint Improvised Explosive Devices Defeat Organization (JIEDDO), and the U.S. Army's Program Manager for DoD Biometrics (PM DoD Biometrics) are pursuing an effort to understand how current COTS tactical handheld biometric collection devices perform against DoD's requirements.       <br>        <br>    Description       <br>           <br>    On behalf of the PSA for Biometrics, the Defense Biometrics and Forensics Office, JIEDDO, and PM DoD Biometrics the U.S. Army Communications-Electronic Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) will be conducting a measured demonstration to determine the effectiveness of COTS tactical biometric device collection devices perform against DoD's requirements.  A measured demonstration is defined as a technology demonstration that assesses the performance of a system against defined metrics, in a controlled environment, and with operational data.  I2WD is conducting this RFI to identify individuals or organizations within industry and academia that have developed a tactical biometric device and would like to participate in this measured demonstration.       <br>              <br>    The measured demonstration is on schedule to occur between July 29 and August 23, 2013.  This demonstration will include documentation review, source code review, hardware/software testing, functional/operational testing, and accuracy testing.  A detailed test plan will be revealed to industry and academia at an Industry Day to be held the week of July 15, 2013.  Test findings and analysis will be provided to the program sponsors.  Participants will ONLY receive findings and analysis pertaining to their submitted systems.  Figure 1 below shows a schedule of expected events and their associated tentative dates.       <br>              <br>    Event Tentative Date (2013)       <br>    Survey Released	  June 20       <br>    Project Kickoff	  June 12       <br>    RFI Released 	  June 20       <br>    RFI Responses Due  July 12       <br>    Receipt of Participant Hardware and Documentation	July 1 - July 26       <br>    Industry Day	July 15       <br>    Measured Demonstration	July 29 - August 23       <br>    Conduct Demonstration Analysis	July 31 - August 28       <br>    Analysis Report Distributed	August 30       <br>        <br>    This RFI requests industry and academia to provide information on their willingness to participate in this measured demonstration.  Participants must identify in their response by the type of tactical biometric devices along with quantities, associated software, documentation (ie user manuals, versions description, third party assessments or Laboratory Evaluations, design documents, system security documentation, source code, and training plans/materials that will be made available to I2WD for the measured demonstration. While lack of a particular resource in the aforementioned categories will not necessarily disqualify a participant, negative test results may be documented during the measured demonstration.  A cost breakout, to include licensing, peripherals, and recurring costs for the submitted Tactical Biometric Collection Device should also be included in the response.       <br>              <br>    Response       <br>              <br>    The Government is requesting industry and academia to provide the following information pertaining to this RFI:       <br>        	A statement of their willingness to participate in the Tactical Biometric Device Technology Demonstration       <br>        	Identification by type and quantity of the resources that will be made available to I2WD for a measure demonstration to include:       <br>       a.

[Are there any?]    <br>         <br>    A: No Test and Evaluation services in support of the Measured Demonstration Phase scheduled 29 July -23 August 2013 are required at this time for this demonstration.     <br>        <br>        <br>    Q: Has a location been determined for the 15 July Industry Day and will pre-registration be required for this event?    <br>        <br>    A:  The Industry Day for the OSD Tactical Biometric Device Technology Demonstration, not to be confused with other PM Biometric Lifecycle Management Industry Days, will be held on July 15, 2013 at MITRE (Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD) between 0800 and 1700.  Exact details will be provided to those who respond to this RFI.    <br>        <br>    Q: I would like to know if the RFI that was released yesterday under W15P7T13RA055 is related to [this similar requirement] that was released under W15QKN13R0013 (from ACC-New Jersey) through FBO for an EMD contract. Is this the same requirement and was transferred over to your office? Or are they nonrelated?    <br>        <br>    A: They are unrelated.    <br>        <br>    Q: Is there a tentative location for the 15 July 2013 Industry Day?    <br>        <br>    A: The Industry Day for the OSD Tactical Biometric Device Technology Demonstration, not to be confused with other PM Biometric Lifecycle Management Industry Days, will be held on July 15, 2013 at MITRE (Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD) between 0800 and 1700.  Exact details will be provided to those who respond to the RFI.       <br>        <br>    Q: Is the Government interested in multi-modal (e.g., fingerprint, face, and iris) or uni-modal (e.g., iris only) Tactical Biometric Collection Devices?  For instance, USSOCOM hosted a Tactical Biometrics Evaluation event in 2012 that evaluated only those commercial systems that provided a capability that met their program requirements of fingerprint, face, and iris multi-modal biometric collection.    <br>        <br>    A: Yes.  This technical evaluation will evaluate both multiple modalities and single modalities as currently required by the Department of Defense.  Priority is focused on devices used to collect and transmit fingerprints, face, and iris.  Products featuring additional modalities and functions will be noted for future evaluations and requirements.    <br>        <br>    Q: Is the Government interested in only COTS Tactical Biometric Collection Devices that are commercially available today, or can vendors offer advanced concept technology demonstrators/prototypes for evaluation?    <br>        <br>    A: Vendors are encouraged to submit prototypes and concept devices that meet and exceed minimum capability requirements.  However, if an advance system or a system under development is submitted for evaluation, the system will be evaluated using the same criteria as the commercially available system with no consideration for the innovative features that are not currently required or in consideration for features that needs to be matured.  If there are substantial numbers of systems submitted for evaluation, testing priority will be on the commercially available systems; i.e. the immature and prototype systems will be evaluated after the commercially available systems in case time does not permit testing all submitted devices.      <br>        <br>    Q: Is the Government interested only in collection devices, without enrollment and/or matching and/or data sharing capabilities?    <br>        <br>    A: The government is seeking to evaluate devices that are used to enroll, match, share, and display biometric results using standard protocols and formats.      <br>        <br>    Q: Will the Government schedule time for vendors to adequately train Government personnel on the use of the Tactical Biometric Collection Device, prior to the formal Measured Demonstrations?    <br>        <br>    A: Yes. It is expected that the government testers will receive instructions from each vendor for each device and have access to vendors SMEs before and during the testing.  The government testers may require access to people who can provide operational instructions for each device, but the assumption is that user manuals will be sufficient and access to SME will be via phone on an as needed bases.    <br>        <br>    Q: In assessing the performance of a Tactical Biometric Collection system against defined metrics in a controlled environment, will the Government be looking for device capabilities to support future identity operations with expanded technical capabilities of capturing biometrics at stand-off, with subjects on the move, and in unconstrained environments with non-cooperative subjects?    <br>        <br>    A: Yes.  The majority of the government evaluation will focus on cooperative biometric collection.  Some non-cooperative collection factors will be reviewed during the evaluation, but the evaluation team will not determine the weights of those factors.  Other identity biometric capabilities that go beyond the requirements will be annotated in a separate report in hopes of scheduling future evaluation and establishing relationships with vendors with other capabilities.     <br>        <br>    Q: Will a vendor's Tactical Biometric Collection Device offering have to be available for the entire period of Measured Demonstrations, from July 29 through August 23, 2013?    <br>        <br>    A: Yes.  However, if there is a need to make it available for a shorter duration; the government evaluation team will work to accommodate vendors' needs.    <br>        <br>    Q: Will vendors have the opportunity to address corrective actions/issues during the course of the Measured Demonstrations?    <br>        <br>    A: Yes.    <br>        <br>    Q: With Measured Demonstrations being conducted on Tactical Biometric Collection Devices, does that mean that FAR and FRR will not be evaluated since matching is not part of the Measured Demonstration plan?    <br>        <br>    A: No.  FAR and FRR is part of the current requirements.    <br>        <br>    Q: Will respondents to the RFI be provided with the Measured Demonstration  quote mark defined metrics quote mark  at the planned Industry Day?    <br>        <br>    A: The Vendors will be provided with the OBJECTIVES on metrics.     <br>        <br>    Q: Will the test findings and analysis provided to a vendor on submitted systems be permitted to be disclosed by that vendor for marketing purposes?     <br>        <br>    A: Yes.    <br>        <br>    Q: Details about industry day (time, location, format) on 15 July?    <br>        <br>    A: (See above)    <br>        <br>    Q: Details on  quote mark receipt of participant hardware and documentation quote mark      <br>        <br>    A: We anticipate receiving both Hardware/Software and documentation for each system submitted.  These will be documented and controlled for both accountability and quality control.    <br>        <br>    Q: What date is the hardware and documentation needed?    <br>        <br>    A: Hardware/Software and documentation are requested as soon as possible but no later than July 26.  If there is a valid reason the equipment can't be received by July 26, it is up to the government evaluation team to decide if Hardware/Software and documentation will be accepted beyond that date.    <br>        <br>    Q: Where should it be delivered, and to whose attention?    <br>        <br>    A: The delivery address for all devices is:    <br>        <br>    ATTN: Mr. Clinton Brown, Biometric Technology Demonstration    <br>    Building 6005, Combat Drive    <br>    Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005    <br>        <br>    Packages may be shipped using FedEX, UPS, or United State Postal Service.    <br>    Package should be mark as  quote mark unclassified quote mark  when appropriate on the outside.     <br>    If sending multiple packages, please number each package and list the total number of packages on each box (ex. Box 1 of 3, box 2 of 3, and box 3 of 3).     <br>    Please include the return address and POC information within the shipping container.     <br>        <br>    Q: Is there POC information to arrange loan of our devices?    <br>        <br>    A: The primary POC for loaned devices is Mr. Clinton Brown and the alternate POC is Mr. Jeffrey Kuderna.     <br>        <br>    Q: How many devices are needed?     <br>        <br>    A: We are requesting three devices, with the same configuration.    <br>        <br>    Q: Will we need to provide training on our device?  How many people need to be trained?  Training in what location?  Training on what date?    <br>        <br>    A: We do not anticipate the need for in person training.  We anticipate that the USER Manuals / USER Guides with on call or telephonic training will be adequate.    <br>        <br>    Q: Will the manufacturer need to be present during the  quote mark measured demonstration quote mark ?    <br>        <br>    A: No. However we will be requesting a POC/SME be available prior to and during the demonstration for questions.    <br>        <br>    Q:  Is the Government looking for only hand-held Tactical Biometric Collection Devices systems, or are systems that are man-portable or utilized in fixed site applications (e.g., portals) also of interest?    <br>        <br>    A:  The evaluation is not limited to handheld devices, but mobility is a factor.  Man-portable and vehicular devices will be accepted.  This evaluation will not include fixed site applications or portals because the government will not have the resources to host the application or equally analyze all devices on the portal.  However, if a device works with a unique application or a specific portal, the additional capabilities will be noted in a separate report in preparation for a future evaluation.     <br>        <br>   Q: Where/when will the industry day be held?   <br>      <br>   A: The Industry Day will be held at MITRE on the second floor on Monday 7/15 from 0800-1700 hours. The address is: Aberdeen Site, 209 Research Blvd., Suite 200, Aberdeen, MD 21001.        <br>   <br> A mass email to all project participants (those who can attend the Industry Day and those who couldn't make it) will be sent out after the meeting (Tuesday or Wednesday) which will include meeting minutes and slides presented.

<DESC>AMENDMENT#1: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED&nbsp;FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. SEE ATTACHED JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (JOFOC).<br /><br /><br />It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) to modify Contract HHSN276200800005C on a sole source basis. It is the NLM's intent to extend the period of performance and increase the contract dollar value for the current Brogan and Partners Advertising Consultancy Inc. contract which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2013. The intent is to extend the present period of performance up to six (6) months (July 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013). The initial award was competed on FBO under NAICS Code 511120 Periodical Publishers. This is a commercial firm-fixed price contract to provide website and publishing services to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to publish the monthly scientific journal Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP).
<p><br />The Government intends to negotiate with the incumbent Contractor, Brogan and Partners Advertising Consultancy Inc., on a sole-source basis. This extension will permit the continuity of services on the current contract and allow an adequate amount of time to re-compete the requirement. Brogan &amp; Partners has the extensive experience necessary to continue meeting the goals and objectives of this contract during the period of re-competition. A new vendor will not be able to provide the required level of services to NIEHS without significant preparatory activities. The incumbent Contractor possesses the immediate institutional knowledge required to continue day-to-day operations of EHP until the contract is successfully re-competed. A different vendor will not be able to provide the required level of performance in the short time required for this extension (0-6 months) without a significant increase in costs and an extended learning curve which could result in a delay in production or disruption of services. By utilizing the incumbent Contractor during this contract extension period, EHP would be able to continue day-to-day operation without unacceptable delay in fulfilling the monthly mission of producing a quality journal of scientific research and news for the world. Also no additional costs would be incurred by NIEHS due to project delays. Therefore, Brogan and Partners is the only Contractor capable of providing comprehensive and uninterrupted services for the NIEHS' EHP in such a brief period of time.</p>
<p><br />This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor is a RFP available; however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the aforementioned modification. Responses must be in writing and must be received electronically at the Government infrastructure by 3:00 PM EST on Monday, May 13, 2013. Proposals must include pricing information and should reference Synopsis No. NIHLM2013732SRE and should be submitted to sheila.edmonds@nih.gov. Inquiries regarding this procurement shall be submitted electronically to sheila.edmonds@nih.gov and shall be received by 2:00 PM EST on Wednesday, May 8, 2013.</p>

<DESC>THE RESPONSE DUE&nbsp;DATE FOR THIS NOTICE&nbsp;HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO JULY 17, 2013 NO LATER THAN @12:00pm.<br /><br /><br />This Request for Information is being posted under the following NAICS codes:
<p>541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology),</p>
<p>541720 - Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities,</p>
<p>541711 - Research and Development in Biotechnology,</p>
<p>611430 - Educational Services, Professional and Management Development Training, and</p>
<p>611310 - Educational Services - Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this request is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The NLM has a Congressional mandate not only to collect and organize the medical literature, but to engage in outreach and training activities that will result in bringing the benefits of NLM's information services to all health professionals. The 1987 NLM Long Range Plan highlighted this mandate, presenting the need for outreach as a major NLM initiative. Also in 1987, the Congress explicitly amended the mission statement of the NLM to add the function: "Publicize the availability of (its) products and services. . ." This was done against the backdrop of recognition by the U.S. Congress that the time had come to "reach out to include all individual health practitioners and to see they have ready access to NLM's information services." An Outreach Panel of leading experts in medical communication, headed by Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, made a number of recommendations to the NLM concerning how it should make its services more widely known and used throughout the biomedical community. The NLM Long Range Plan 2006-2016, in its recommendations under Goal 4: A Strong and Diverse Workforce<br />for Biomedical Informatics Research, Systems Development and Innovative Service Delivery, reaffirmed this mandate, presenting the need for training a strong and diverse workforce as a continuing need and a major NLM initiative.</p>
<p>NLM has funded and shaped biomedical informatics education and training for 35 years,<br />including programs to reach physicians and other health care professionals, biomedical science faculty, librarians, and students. Over the next ten years a greatly expanded and more diverse workforce of health care professionals, informaticians and librarians trained in informatics will be needed to develop and deploy systems to support basic, clinical, and translational research, to support telemedicine and electronic health records, and to support the use of literature and genomic databases.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objective</strong></p>
<p>NLM's long range planning panel members have instructed the Library to undertake a broad program of educating and training health professionals in the use of the many sources of computerized medical information available. The members emphasized the need to reach health professionals early in their careers so they could serve as "change agents" for their colleagues. This project would allow the NLM to continue to reach an influential group of such health professionals and to introduce them to the benefits of computerized information resources and the application of computer technologies and information science in biomedicine.</p>
<p>The proposed outreach project is a continuation of a highly successful program for training scientists, educators, librarians, physicians and other health professionals in the principles of biomedical informatics and the use of a broad range of information technologies and electronic information resources.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Requirements</span></p>
<p>l. Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary work, materials, supplies, equipment, and services (except as otherwise specified herein) and perform the work set forth below.</p>

The contractor will arrange and coordinate all travel arrangements for the students and non-Federal faculty. The contractor will also secure approval for formal Continuing Education credits for health professionals and librarians through appropriate professional or educational organizations. Identifying a course director, choosing faculty, defining the curriculum, and selecting students from among the applicants will be the full responsibility of the NLM and the designated course director in conjunction with outside NLM advisors.</p>

<p>611310 - Educational Services - Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this request is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The NLM has a Congressional mandate not only to collect and organize the medical literature, but to engage in outreach and training activities that will result in bringing the benefits of NLM's information services to all health professionals. The 1987 NLM Long Range Plan highlighted this mandate, presenting the need for outreach as a major NLM initiative. Also in 1987, the Congress explicitly amended the mission statement of the NLM to add the function: "Publicize the availability of (its) products and services. . ." This was done against the backdrop of recognition by the U.S. Congress that the time had come to "reach out to include all individual health practitioners and to see they have ready access to NLM's information services." An Outreach Panel of leading experts in medical communication, headed by Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, made a number of recommendations to the NLM concerning how it should make its services more widely known and used throughout the biomedical community. The NLM Long Range Plan 2006-2016, in its recommendations under Goal 4: A Strong and Diverse Workforce<br />for Biomedical Informatics Research, Systems Development and Innovative Service Delivery, reaffirmed this mandate, presenting the need for training a strong and diverse workforce as a continuing need and a major NLM initiative.</p>
<p>NLM has funded and shaped biomedical informatics education and training for 35 years,<br />including programs to reach physicians and other health care professionals, biomedical science faculty, librarians, and students. Over the next ten years a greatly expanded and more diverse workforce of health care professionals, informaticians and librarians trained in informatics will be needed to develop and deploy systems to support basic, clinical, and translational research, to support telemedicine and electronic health records, and to support the use of literature and genomic databases.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objective</strong></p>
<p>NLM's long range planning panel members have instructed the Library to undertake a broad program of educating and training health professionals in the use of the many sources of computerized medical information available. The members emphasized the need to reach health professionals early in their careers so they could serve as "change agents" for their colleagues. This project would allow the NLM to continue to reach an influential group of such health professionals and to introduce them to the benefits of computerized information resources and the application of computer technologies and information science in biomedicine.</p>
<p>The proposed outreach project is a continuation of a highly successful program for training scientists, educators, librarians, physicians and other health professionals in the principles of biomedical informatics and the use of a broad range of information technologies and electronic information resources.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Requirements</span></p>

<DESC>Project Description:  <br>  The Canaveral lock was constructed in 1951 with timber approach guide walls extending approximately 600 feet from both the East and West side of the monolith lock structure. The approach timber guide walls were previously repaired in 1979, but the environmental deterioration has created some timber piles in a state of failure. This makes the deteriorated portions of the approach walls unsuitable to resist the required mooring or impact loads.   <br>  Project scope is to provide a repair for the Canaveral Lock East and West timber approach walls to prevent failure and restore the walls to an operational condition. New fiberglass/concrete composite marine pilings shall be installed to replace the existing piles. Fiber-reinforced plastic  <br>  fenders and structural plastic framing will be removed and either replaced or reinstalled as detail in the contract drawings. Member connections shall use stainless hardware and all existing hardware shall be replaced with stainless steel. Existing creosote timber marine piles shall be removed at the mudline. All removed creosote timber bracing, marine piles, and fenders shall be disposed in an approved landfill. Work also includes the service of a dedicated manatee observer. Location: The work is located at the Canaveral Lock and Barge Canal, Canaveral Harbor, Brevard County, Florida along the eastern coastline of Florida. The Lock and Barge Canal work area can be accessed via Port Canaveral ocean entrance, Canaveral Barge Canal from the Intracoastal Waterway, and Interstate 95 and local connectors. The magnitude of construction for this project is estimated to be between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. THIS IS AN SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE PROCUREMENT.  The solicitation will be issued on or about 01 Aug 2013 with proposal due on or about 01 Sep 2013. Solicitation will be issued in electronic format only and will be posted on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at  https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/. In order to receive notification of any amendments to this solicitation, interested vendors must REGISTER AS AN INTERESTED VENDOR on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

Information regarding GSA Schedules can be found at www.GSA.gov. <BR> <BR>This requirement is unrestricted and only qualified sellers may submit bids.The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on 2013-07-08 16:30:00.0 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com.FOB Destination shall be Syracuse, NY 13210 <BR> <BR>The VHA NCO 02 - 528 - Upstate New York HCS requires the following items, Brand Name or Equal, to the following:  <BR><span class="label">LI 001: </span>SQUARE D MOTOR RACKING DEVICE, 1, EA; <BR><span class="label">LI 002: </span>SQUARE D ELECTRIC RACK DOOR ADAPTOR ASSEMBLY, 1, EA; <BR> <BR><a href="https://marketplace.fedbid.com/fbweb/fbobuyDetails.do?token=%3D%3DwBKxmaVGYR9CDQlKZRLHbHQAAAAAHeAAgAgTFCGg%2FFzzqQbJAAyVXBA0Or">Solicitation and Buy Attachments </a> <BR> <BR>***Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable the Buyer to respond.

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 02 - 528 - Upstate New York HCS is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because this is an order under an existing contract that was awarded using non-competitive procedures. <br>  <br> This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because it was not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. As such, a time-and-materials type action was awarded for non-commercial supplies and services (FAR 16.601(c)). <br>  <br> This synopsis applies to all current and future task orders placed under contract W91215-09-D-0001 for the continued design, development, and maintenance of Advanced Mission Planning Tools (AMPT) for the Special Operations Mission Planning Office (SOMPO).  On 15 May 2009, Westar Aerospace & Defense Group, Inc (Westar), Huntsville, Alabama, CAGE Code 67285, was awarded a five year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a maximum value of $10,000,000. The work will be performed at Westar in Huntsville, Alabama. The ordering period is from 15 May 2009 through 14 May 2014. This contract was awarded using other than full and open competition because the contract was a follow-on contract for work previously completed by Westar and seeking another vendor would have encountered unacceptable risks. <br>  <br> As of 12 July 2013, 14 time and materials and firm fixed price task orders have been awarded with a total value of $4,657,106.20. Please contact the vendor for any subcontracting opportunities.
