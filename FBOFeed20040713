<DESC>The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), solicits CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS for the study entitled "SURFACE CIRCULATION RADAR MAPPING IN ALASKAN COASTAL WATERS:  FIELD STUDY BEAUFORT SEA AND COOK INLET". The NAICS code is 541710.  The MMS intends to competitively award a contract to meet specific study objectives. LEVEL OF EFFORT:  Funding up to $900,000 may be available for this estimated forty-eight (48) month study.  OBJECTIVE:  The purpose of this research is to test hypotheses with regards to the collection of surface current measurements (using High Frequency (HF) Doppler radar units) within the Alaskan Beaufort Sea OCS Sea Planning Area, central Beaufort Sea, from approximately150° to 146° West Longitude and 70° to 71° North Latitude (approximate bathymetric range, 0-30 meter bathymetric contours), and the Lower Cook Inlet Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Planning Area, between 154°and 150° West Longitude and 59° and 60° 30' North Latitude. The surface current measurements and tested hypotheses will improve the present understanding of the surface circulation in these areas under open water and mixed ice conditions. The surface current results will also be used by MMS for validation, comparison, and boundary condition analysis of general circulation models and for oil spill risk analysis. The study will be procured under National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP).  The MMS, teamed with NOAA/NOS/CO-PO (Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and services), has developed this joint project. On behalf of the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP), the Minerals Management Service solicits research proposals meeting the goal and purpose of the Partnership Program outlined in Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201. Team efforts among academia, industry, and government participants are encouraged (at least 2 of the 3).  Cost sharing or proposals augmenting ongoing partnership efforts are very strongly encouraged.  SCOPE OF WORK:  MMS HF DOPPLER RADAR DEPLOYMENT SCHEDULE FOR THE BEAUFORT SEA AND COOK INLET: This RFP requires at least two seasons in the Beaufort Sea and one season in the Cook Inlet. The Contractor will deploy and maintain two to three HF Doppler radar units in the Beaufort Sea during two consecutive Spring to Fall (June through October) mixed ice and open water periods.  The deployments will commence in June 2005, during the opening of coastal leads and end in October 2006 during the formation of land fast ice.  The Beaufort Sea units will be shut down during the intervening winter months.  In October 2006, the HF Doppler radar units from the Beaufort Sea project study area will be transported to the Cook Inlet project study area where the HF radar will be deployed to collect surface current data from November 2006 through November 2007. GENERAL HYPOTHESES: BEAUFORT SEA HYPOTHESES (MAY THROUGH OCTOBER, IN YEARS 2005 AND 2006): 1) HF radar will provide improved oceanographic measurement capabilities in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, under varying and seasonal ice conditions; 2) HF radar will improve understanding of potential pollutant (oil) transport under both arctic freeze-up and breakup conditions; 3) HF radar offers serendipitous potential beyond standard 2-D mapping of surface water currents. COOK INLET HYPOTHESES (NOVEMBER 2006 THROUGH NOVEMBER 2007): 1) HF radar will identify, resolve, and map regional oceanographic features that may concentrate or otherwise effect pollutant (oil) transport. 2) HF radar will quantify tidal and seasonal variation of these regional oceanographic features; 3) HF radar will provide currently unavailable information to oceanographic models of Cook Inlet such as detailed, measured surface water flux through the mouth of Cook Inlet for use in boundary conditions and mass conservation evaluation. BEAUFORT SEA SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: 1) Deploy and maintain a minimum of two (preferably three) HF Doppler surface radar sites along the Beaufort Sea shoreline from June, during the opening of the coastal leads through October, ceasing operations after the coastal land fast ice has formed for the years 2005 and 2006; The Contractor will collect, analyze, disseminate over the Internet, and archive surface current vector direction and speed measurements in open water and mixed ice conditions over a distance that is approximately 10-50km from shore and that has a resolution of approximately 250m to 3Km.  The surface current measurements will be used to resolve circulation patterns landward (inside) and seaward (outside) of the barrier islands to about the 30 meter bathymetric contour; 2) Collect surface current measurements during spring breakup (and fresh water inflow), opening of coastal leads, mixed ice and open water conditions, open water conditions, freeze-up and during the initial formation of land fast ice. COOK INLET SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: 1)Provide year-round quality controlled surface current vector direction and speed measurements over a radial distance that is approximately 50-80 km from shore and that has a resolution of 1-3Km through the deployment of HF Doppler surface radar along the Cook Inlet shoreline; 2) Map and interpret the signal response and surface current measurement capability from the radar systems over for an entire season; 3) Map the spatial variability of tidal currents and eddy dynamics. BEAUFORT SEA AND COOK INLET COMMON OBJECTIVES: 1) Examine the effects that sea ice concentration and extent has on the collection of surface current measurements from HF Doppler radar; 2)Validate the HF Doppler radar surface current data measurements by comparing these data against the sub surface current measurements from the Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs); 3) Compare and contrast the wind measurements from MMS or other adjacent coastal meteorological stations against the surface current measurements from HF Doppler radar system; 3) Develop a web site and ground capability to monitor system integrity and performance; 4) Provide near real-time dissemination of surface current field data, vector maps, and surface current animations; 5) Provide detailed analysis of current variability and system response from the HF Doppler radar; 6) Determine the dynamics and variability of surface current circulation. Include in your analysis of sea-ice, bathymetry, meteorological, ADCP, drifter, tidal, sea surface temperature or other important comparative data within the study area. THE BEAUFORT SEA AND COOK INLET - TASKS:  TASK 1; Site Investigations and Site Selection: A detailed study of the topography of the Beaufort Sea and the Cook Inlet shoreline and its implication on radar coverage is needed before making final site selections.  The Contractor is responsible for identifying a minimum of four prospective sites.  Any combination of three sites shall provide the maximum coverage and accuracy to calculate the surface current speed and direction over the largest area. In addition, the Contractor will deploy and evaluate the optimal equipment, and infrastructure that would meet or exceed the stated objectives within this RFP.  The Contractor shall provide good reasons based upon the field conditions to deploy specific units at specific frequencies based upon the stated objectives for capturing data for either the Beaufort Sea or Cook Inlet. In addition, the site investigation shall address any potential radio or other. The Contractor is encouraged to form partnerships with private, government and non-profit agencies. BEAUFORT SEA HF DOPPLER RADAR SITE SELECTIONS:  Three potential site selections have been identified by MMS for the Beaufort Sea, without field testing, by utilizing a line of sight program and USGS Digital Elevation Models (DEM's) with Environmental Systems Research Inc. ESRI, ARCGIS software. These three potential sites are the following: (1) Milne Point; (2) West Dock Oil and NOAA Tide Gauge Station; and the (3) Endicott Oil facility. Other potential sites may be located north of the Badami Oil field and at the Milne Point Oil Field. The Contractor shall evaluate these and other potential sites if necessary for their usefulness and applicability to the project objectives. When choosing the type and frequency of the HF Doppler radar system, the Contractor must consider the limited fetch conditions during the breakup of the land fast ice in the Beaufort Sea. COOK INLET HF DOPPLER RADAR SITE SELECTIONS: During a recent MMS meeting in Anchorage called "MMS Research Sponsorship Meeting on the Mapping of Surface Currents from HF in Alaska", three HF radar site locations were proposed for the MMS field project.  Two sites, Anchor Point and Nanwalek, were previously studied by researchers at NOAA and the University of Fairbanks. The Contractor shall evaluate these sites for their potential usefulness and applicability to the projects success.  The Contractor will use the Anchor Point and Nanwalek sites, and be responsible for adding a third site, preferably on the west site of Cook Inlet that will maximize the coverage and accuracy from all three sites. TASK 2, Field Report: Provide a report to MMS that synthesizes the results from the site visit and provides the recommendations on the final site selections for MMS review.  The report shall contain maps displaying the radial range of coverage and the potential overlap established by the field tests and a timetable and strategy to initiate the collection of data and maintenance all of the equipment. The Contractor shall identify all of the power requirements from all of the field systems and how those requirements will be supported in the field.  The report shall clearly state how such operations will be supported in the field, and how problems will be quickly identified and corrected, so as to minimize the loss of data. The Contractor shall describe how the HF Doppler radar hardware, software and output will be monitored remotely. The Contractor shall provide a system that links remotely via a high speed Internet connection.  The Contractor shall describe how the data will be disseminated to the public, and archived on and off site over the projects time period of performance.  The field report shall address how all of the MMS study objectives will be addressed. The report shall describe how the Contractor will acquire all permissions in writing if necessary from the landowners to install and access the HF Systems over the life of the project.  The Contractor shall address any potential interference to private, government, or subsistence concerns in the area. TASK 3, Deployment, Installation, Calibration, and Maintenance of HF Doppler Radar Units: The HF Doppler radar units for the Beaufort Sea and Cook Inlet will be deployed based upon the results from the field reports within Task 2;  Each radar shall consist of transmit antennas, receive antennas, signal processing electronics, and a central computer.  The electronics and computer will be mounted in weather-proof, animal proof, temperature controlled structures.  Power will be connected to existing facilities when possible. Remote power needs will be installed, as necessary, to run the network.  The units will be calibrated subsequent to deployment and during intervals needed to provide high quality data. Regular maintenance of the system will be done to minimize the loss of data. System performance will be monitored at all times via a high speed Internet connection. All system corrections will be accomplished rapidly, especially during the very limited data collection time period for the Beaufort Sea. For the Beaufort Sea, during sufficient open water conditions, the HF Doppler radar units shall be capable of mapping surface ocean currents within a distance of 10-50 km from shoreline. The radars shall be of sufficient resolution to capture the surface current measurements during the development of the coastal leads and addition to resolving the currents around the barrier islands. For the Cook Inlet, High Frequency Doppler radars will be deployed in an array capable of mapping surface ocean currents within a distance of 50-80 km from the Cook Inlet shoreline sites. TASK 4; Collection and Analysis of Surface Current Measurements: The Contractor will collect, analyze, and describe the surface current measurements as defined in the objectives.  The Contractor will use such methods as stick diagrams or other analysis to correlate wind velocity and direction from MMS funded measurements or other local meteorological stations to HF Doppler radar generated surface current measurements. Scatter plots, cross-spectral, power spectra analysis, or other types of analyzes will be used to compare the surface current measurements from the HF Doppler radar to the sub surface currents obtained through the use ADCP's or other current measuring devices. Sea ice concentration and extent will be compared to the spatial and temporal extent of the return signal and output from the HF Doppler radar. RADARSAT, MODIS or other types of imagery shall be utilized if necessary to monitor the response of HF Doppler radar to the changing ice conditions, especially during breakup, particularly for the Beaufort Sea. Additional research objectives for the Beaufort Sea include determining HF Doppler radar capability to provide information on mesoscale winds (e.g. sea breeze strength and extent in Beaufort Sea, and improved bathymetry). For the Cook Inlet, examine the capability of the HF radar to provide improved information for correlation to mesoscale winds and wind jets and bathymetry. Map and interpret the spatial variability of surface currents and eddy dynamics in the Lower Cook Inlet. Interpret the seasonal and tidal cycle variability of surface currents in open water and in mixed ice and open water conditions. Compare the tidal rips identified in other studies to the surface current measurements collected with the HF Doppler radar. Use existing Cook Inlet HFR-derived surface current velocity data sets to create products that would be of use to the maritime community, such as tidal constituents.  These products could be made available to operational interests such as the NOAA/NOS/Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) and be web-linked to the PORTS® program of CO-OPS.  When the present project produces HFR-derived velocity data from Cook Inlet, these data could also be subjected to the same analysis. TASK 5; Validation of Surface Current Data: Beaufort Sea:  ADCP's will be used to validate the surface current measurements measured from the HF Doppler radar.  Researchers at the University of Alaska, at Fairbanks are scheduled to collect radial subsurface current data using upward looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP's) on the Beaufort Sea shelf. The units are planned to be installed during the summer of 2004. At least one of the units is planned for installation within the planned study area.  The Contractor for this project will request access to the ADCP data for the purpose of validation of the HF Doppler radar surface current data measurements.  The Contractor may propose to deploy additional ADCP systems for validation purposes if necessary, and if budget allows. Cook Inlet: To quality-control the radar-derived current measurements with in-situ measurements, and to sample their vertical structure, Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers ADCP's or other surface or near surface measurement devices will be deployed simultaneously on shallow water moorings. The radars and current meters will be installed within the proposed study area. Comparisons will be made between radial currents measured by the ADCPs and the surface current radars. If necessary, sea ice data shall be integrated into the validation process since it may have an affect on the response from the HF Doppler radar instruments sensitivity to map surface currents during the winter months in the Cook Inlet. TASK 6; Establish a Web Site for Data Validation, to Test System Integrity, and to Provide Public Access to Project Information: The Contractor shall design, build and deploy the infrastructure required to disseminate near real- time surface current measurements from field locations to a central web site accessible to MMS, and the general public. The Contractor must establish a high speed Internet connection to monitor the quality of the incoming data, analyze and dissemination of the data over the Internet in near-real time. The central computer will poll the remote sites hourly, initiate raw data retrieval, combine radial currents into vector current maps, and transfer the maps of currents to a central server for archiving, Internet dissemination, and analysis. The operation will be streamlined so that all data will be processed automatically.  All of the raw data will be archived with a backup stored offsite. The web site shall provide a general description of the study effort and its objectives along with a map displaying the station locations. It shall describe the deployment schedule, daily operational system status, data validation, station log, site photos, near-real time surface current measurements in graphical format, and surface current animations. The surface current maps will be available over the Internet and will be distributed at a minimum of every hour to aid those interests with a need for this information on an operational basis. The Contractor will determine the feasibility of storing the interpreted surface current measurements in a database that can be queried by spatial extent and date range. For data validation, time series comparisons will be made and presented in graphical format on the web between radial currents measured by the DCPs and the surface current data from the HF Doppler radar. TASK 7; REPORT SUBMISSION: An ANNUAL report will be provided which summarizes the previous year's operations, results, and analysis based upon the stated objectives.  The report will contain maps and analysis of the surface current measurements in different mixed ice and open water conditions. Validation of the surface current measurements will be corroborated from all available ancillary data.  The Contractor will propose any changes for the next field season. The usefulness of the radar will be addressed based upon the changing ice conditions. The contractor shall submit a final report that summarizes the field operations, data results, and analysis for all years, and shall combine the data from all years and provide an analysis of all data sets, operational, and environmental conditions. The FINAL report shall specifically address the type of data captured during the changing ice condition surrounding the radar sites and shall identify major contributions from this study with regards to our understanding of surface current circulation. TASK 8; Database and Database Documentation: On an annual basis, or subsequent to each field season, the interpreted data from all of the surface current measurements will be provided to MMS along with the data documentation. The Contractor shall complete this task considering the developing system being designed by the Data management and Communications Committees (DMAC) of the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) and Alaska Ocean Observing System (AOOS).  The Contractor is responsible for coordinating directly with the DMAC's. If particular portions of the DMAC system such as the database format have not been developed, then MMS would use existing data formats as described at http://marine.rutgers.edu/mrs/newcodar/data/FileFormat.txt. All the surface current measurement data shall be delivered to MMS in a MMS compatible database so that surface current measurements can be queried by spatial (geographic) and temporal (date/time range) extent. TASK 9, Bibliographic Database of HF Doppler Radar Surface Current Mapping Studies: Compile a bibliographic database of pertinent citations on the use of HF Doppler radar for the mapping of surface currents. The extent of the bibliography will be limited to the available budget. If budget allows, the references shall be compiled alphabetically in standard format and any abstracts and papers included with the citations. The citations and possible linked articles shall be included in a ProCite database. TASK 10, Preparation and Submission of Journal Article: The Contractor shall prepare and submit a scientific article(s) to a peer-reviewed journal(s).  Drafts of manuscripts will be provided to MMS prior to journal submittal.  Articles will summarize major objectives, methods, significant results, conclusions, and implications of the work.  All journal articles must include MMS in the acknowledgments section and reference the agreement number to facilitate accession through the Environmental Studies Program Information System (ESPIS).  Because of the long lead time that is usual for scientific publication, the Contractor is encouraged to start on this submission in parallel with or prior to completion of the final report. EVALUATION OF CAPABILITY STATEMENTS: Experience and expertise of all Key Personnel with the technical knowledge and experience to accomplish all of the stated tasks: The contractor must provide information on which task(s) each key personnel will perform and the rational for their assignment. The key personnel must have prior experience in deployment, collection and analysis of surface current measurements from HF Doppler radar.

The Application Server shall be connected to a stand-alone Paging System (not interfaced with an existing hospital paging system) to alert clinicians of alarm conditions via pagers.  Each Application Server and its associated software package will able to monitor 24 bedside devices. Additional Application Servers may be added to accommodate more devices.  Ventilator patients can be monitored in specific care areas or on more than one floor, and all monitoring and alarm information can be made available wherever needed. The unit can prioritize and filter alarms; it allows ventilator parameters to be transcribed automatically during routine shift checks. The unit also provides trending of respiratory parameters and has the ability to interface with the hospital LAN so that data can be viewed on any web enabled device.  At a minimum, the system should include (2) work stations, (1) central server, (4) access points, (1) distributed power supply, (10) client bridges to Viasys Vela ventilators, (1) Pager System, (4) additional pagers, ventilation management software and one year software support agreement, on-site installation and on-site applications training.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement the program to help Madagascar achieve effective management and control of its forest ecosystems.  The primary means by which this purpose can be met, and which will be the most important activity in this contract, is to revamp and revitalize the Malagasy Forest Service to ensure sustainable forest management.  The role and value of forests in Madagascar has been insufficiently recognized in development policy and planning, yet the value of forests to economic and ecological systems is indisputable.  Forests provide essential environmental services including protecting urban and agricultural watersheds, cycling nutrients, providing local and global tempering of climate, sequestering of carbon, buffering the spread of pests and pathogens, offering recreational and aesthetic benefits, and others.  In addition, forests offer economic benefits in the form of timber and non-timber resources, and increasingly for ecotourism.  

The work conducted under the Contract awarded through this RFP will be integrated with implementation mechanisms for other activities under the overall strategic objective for Environment and Rural Development.  We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a December 1, 2003.

<CONTACT>Craig Frame, Contracting Officer, 202-287-1463, craig.frame@hq.doe.gov;Timothy Jackson, Contract Specialist, 202-287-1472, timothy.jackson@hq.doe.gov
<DESC>This is a sole source acquisition under FAR 6.302-1 one responsible source for the Civil Engineering Research Foundation (CERF).  The maximum value of its maximum five year term is $1.25 million This is a sole source acquisition providing research studies that will identify project management factors, including productivity and performance metrics; strategy to develop a sustainable, qualified federal workforce for managing the number and complexity of projects required to achieve missions; benchmarking for development of performance metrics for evaluating all phases of project management; and identification, assessment and mitigation of project risks throughout the life cycle of projects.  This independent assessment research effort will also include research, data gathering and analysis to share best practices and lessons learned in the project management of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified building construction including examples of LEED rating system criteria within the Whole Building Design Guide. CERF will perform technical expert, neutral, independent research assessments of task order work scopes.  The contractor acts as both a facilitator and consensus-builder among the diverse elements of the construction industry bringing together suppliers, consumers, academics, practitioners and government agencies.  This research will identify best practices, barriers to implementation, market potential and economic impact of key construction initiatives. The CERF, a nonprofit institution, is an affiliate of the global American Society of Civil Engineers.  The CERF works to promote innovation and enhance collaboration within the construction, design and environmental industries. CERF acts as both a facilitator and a consensus-builder among the diverse elements of the construction industry, bringing together suppliers and consumers, academics and practitioners, and government agencies.   CERF?s Corporate Advisory Board is made up of senior executives from the corporate and government communities, who learn of new and innovative technology processes and products to advance the state-of-the-practice, project delivery, and operational practices.  As such, in addition to CERF?s paid staff, CERF has access to a large pool of volunteer civil and construction engineers from corporate, government and academia to address assigned research areas, saving DOE money. Additionally, access to CERF?s civil engineering research database will save DOE time and money pulling from completed research studies similar to DOE?s required scope.  CERF, a nonprofit institution providing expert neutral collaboration, has recently developed Critical Infrastructure Protection Priorities for the Department of Homeland Security, consensus recommendations for the Infrastructure Security Partnership organized by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and identified specific productivity metrics and strategies for the construction project delivery process and compare military and commercial projects for the Air Force.  The essential research capability provided by CERF is recognized as a national center of excellence in construction, project management, and civil engineering.  No other independent academic or nonprofit institution has the industry and government recognition, construction management experience and knowledge to perform the research to the degree necessary to reach legitimate, independent conclusions from the research analysis.  This effort will build on the CERF?s large body of existing research. It is unrealistic and probably an organizational conflict of interest to consider any of the Department?s prime construction contractors or the contractors OECM uses to perform external independent reviews to evaluate their own projects. Firms who want to demonstrate their interest will provide sufficient documentation to demonstrate their ability to provide the same services that CERF is able to provide.  Interest should be submitted to Timothy Jackson, Contract Specialist.  The due date for submission is August 16, 2004. See Note 22.

<DESC>This is the preliminary notice for a solicitation to be released O/A July 16, 2004 for  administrative services for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Directorate of Technology Corporate Information Officer (CIO).  Interested firms need to read this notice completely and follow instructions provided.  The entire notice is found on the Federal Business Opportunity website at www.fedbizops.gov under the Department of Labor, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management (OASAM), Washington, DC offices.  The requirement will be for a base year and four option years, and is a 100% set aside for service-disabled-veteran-owned small businesses under NAICS 541519, size standard $21 million.  This means that only service-disabled-veteran-owned small businesses are eligible to submit proposals for this requirement.  This procurement is a commercial item procurement and is being streamlined in accordance with the requirements of FAR Part 12.  A paper solicitation will not be issued.  The statement of work will be provided in a subsequent amendment under this solicitation number, O/A July 16, 2004 electronically on the Federal Business Opportunity website at www.fedbizops.gov under the Department of Labor, Office of the Undersecretary for Administration Services and Management (OASAM), Washington, DC offices.  To assist offerors in complying with Federal Government-unique requirements and to provide the evaluation factors and basis of award, a solicitation schedule will also be provided with fill-ins for prices and the applicable contract clauses.  Interested parties falling under the set-aside criteria may elect to contact the incumbent contractor, AIM, Inc, 301-794-8200,  concerning any possible opportunities to utilize AIM as a subcontractor.  AIM is a large business under the NAICS and size standard criteria.  Formation of any business partnerships will be at the sole discretion and responsibility of the individual service-disabled veterans-owned small businesses and AIM, if AIM chooses to participate as a subcontractor.  Eligible firms which are not utilizing AIM as a subcontractor will be evaluated without regard to this fact.  Other firms falling outside of the NAICS and size standard will not be eligible to submit proposals as a prime contractor but may do so as a subcontractor to a service-disabled-veterans-owned small business.  Any small business must also be service-disabled-veteran-owned in order to submit an order as a prime contractor.  The DOL does not have a listing of service-disabled-veterans-owned small business firms available.  CAUTION:  Be careful concerning “teams” when responding to this proposal, as this terminology has contractual and legal meanings in the area of small business procurements beyond the common dictionary definition of the word “team”.  A “team” under the Federal Acquisition Regulation means that your company and another firm have formed a special business entity for purposes of submitting a single offer, and that neither party has a separate and distinct prime contractor/subcontractor relationship.  Any teaming arrangements of this type must be approved by the SBA for purposes of submitting an offer under this procurement.   Potential offerors should be aware in advance that 1) the SBA measures “teams” by the combined assets of all firms in the team as compared to the size standard, which is $21 million, meaning that any team with assets of over $21 million will likely not be approved by the SBA, and 2) This procurement will not be paced by the amount of time necessary to form any such teams, as long as the DOL’s interests are adequately served by allowing for competition under prime contractor, subcontractor relationships (meaning that if the DOL is made aware subsequent to release of this solicitation that at least two firms can submit offers as prime contractors without requiring SBA approval for teams, we will not delay the procurement to provide more time for team formation.).  Any small business providing an offer under this procurement must also possess service-disabled veteran-owned status in order to submit an offer as a prime contractor.

<DESC>This is the preliminary notice for a solicitation to be released O/A July 16, 2004 for Information Technology services in support of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) software development, operations and maintenance support.  Interested firms need to read this notice completely and follow instructions provided.  The entire notice is found on the Federal Business Opportunity website at www.fedbizops.gov under the Department of Labor, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management (OASAM), Washington, DC offices.  The requirement will be for a base year and four option years, and is a 100% set aside for service-disabled-veteran-owned small businesses under NAICS 541519, size standard $21 million.  This means that only service-disabled-veteran-owned small businesses are eligible to submit proposals for this requirement.  This procurement is a commercial item procurement and is being streamlined in accordance with the requirements of FAR Part 12.  A paper solicitation will not be issued.  The statement of work will be provided in a subsequent amendment under this solicitation number, O/A July 16, 2004 electronically on the Federal Business Opportunity website at www.fedbizops.gov under the Department of Labor, Office of the Undersecretary for Administration Services and Management (OASAM), Washington, DC offices.  To assist offerors in complying with Federal Government-unique requirements and to provide the evaluation factors and basis of award, a solicitation schedule will also be provided with fill-ins for prices and the applicable contract clauses.  Interested parties falling under the set-aside criteria may elect to contact previous incumbent contractors, STG, Inc. 202-691-2480 or Eastern Research Group, 781-674-7200 concerning any possible opportunities to utilize STG or ERG as a subcontractor.  Both firms are large businesses under the NAICS and size standard criteria.  Formation of any business partnerships will be at the sole discretion and responsibility of the individual service-disabled veterans-owned small businesses and these businesses, if the businesses choose to participate as a subcontractor.  Eligible firms which are not utilizing either firm  as a subcontractor will be evaluated without regard to this fact.  Other firms falling outside of the NAICS and size standard will not be eligible to submit proposals as a prime contractor but may do so as a subcontractor to a service-disabled-veterans-owned small business.  Any small business must also be service-disabled-veteran-owned in order to submit an order as a prime contractor.  The DOL does not have a listing of service-disabled-veterans-owned small business firms available.  CAUTION:  Be careful concerning “teams” when responding to this proposal, as this terminology has contractual and legal meanings in the area of small business procurements beyond the common dictionary definition of the word “team”.  A “team” under the Federal Acquisition Regulation means that your company and another firm have formed a special business entity for purposes of submitting a single offer, and that neither party has a separate and distinct prime contractor/subcontractor relationship.  Any teaming arrangements of this type must be approved by the SBA for purposes of submitting an offer under this procurement.   Potential offerors should be aware in advance that 1) the SBA measures “teams” by the combined assets of all firms in the team as compared to the size standard, which is $21 million, meaning that any team with assets of over $21 million will likely not be approved by the SBA, and 2) This procurement will not be paced by the amount of time necessary to form any such teams, as long as the DOL’s interests are adequately served by allowing for competition under prime contractor, subcontractor relationships (meaning that if the DOL is made aware subsequent to release of this solicitation that at least two firms can submit offers as prime contractors without requiring SBA approval for teams, we will not delay the procurement to provide more time for team formation.).  Any small business providing an offer under this procurement must also possess service-disabled veteran-owned status in order to submit an offer as a prime contractor.

<DESC>The Economic Research Service (ERS) of the United States Department of Agriculture seeks to purchase household based retail food purchase scanner data for the years 2002 and 2003 to conduct research on the economics of interactions between consumers’ purchasing behavior and food retailing.  This research is in support of the Department’s programs and policies. (Examples of current objectives are outlined below.) In addition, ERS seeks to purchase custom analyses on an ad-hoc basis.  These analyses would focus on specific issues and the influence they may be having on specific food products, market conditions, demographic groups, or any combination of the above-mentioned items.  (For example, what is the influence of changes in labeling guidelines on consumer purchase behavior for specific products or categories?)Findings are often disseminated by publishing in a variety of outlets such as academic journals, applied economic journals, ERS technical bulletins, ERS agricultural economic reports, etc.  (ERS does not disseminate or publish proprietary, firm, or establishment level data.)  In addition, ERS conducts staff analyses for internal use.  Internal staff analyses are conducted for the Administration, the Congress, or the Department of Agriculture. ERS occasionally enters into cooperative agreements and memorandums of understanding with academics at Universities to assist us with research priorities and the implementation of economic analyses.  The work may require that we grant access to the data.  However, the agreements require that the data not be released to any other party and that the data be returned to ERS upon completion of the work.  Cooperators are restricted by the provisions of the contract and may not publish or report any portion of the raw data, and may only publish results from the economic analyses.
Research Goals and Objectives	Specific research goals and objectives include:1.	Investigate the impact of USDA's National Organic Program on product differentiation and household demand for differentiated milk products (organic, non-rBGH, and conventional). 2. Identify what price households pay for foods purchased and how household demographics, including income, affect prices paid and quantities purchased.3.  Identify differences in food prices across markets in the U.S. and analyze the impact the increasing number of alternative retail outlets for food on food prices and accessibility.4.  Investigate the effect of different tastes and preferences across households on food demand.5.  Measure the impact of consumer food purchasing behavior on food prices, accessibility, services, and assortment.6.  Investigate the impact of the increasing number of value added food products on food marketing firms and agricultural producers.

Tasks	The contractor shall be required to perform the following tasks:1.  ERS seeks a demographically and geographically representative sample of U.S. household-based food purchase scanner data.  The data shall contain purchase and demographics for the years 2002 and 2003 and be ready for delivery on or about January 1, 2005.  This data shall include individual transaction level information that would cover food purchases by each household for all food store outlets available to a household and identify the store from which each item is purchased.  In addition, identification of any food products labeled ‘organic’, ‘non-RBST’, ‘genetically-engineered’, ‘GE’, ‘non-GE’, and/or ‘non-RBGH’ shall be clearly identified.  This contractor shall be required to provide coverage of all major food categories including meats, poultry, fish, dairy, fruits, and vegetables, and dry grocery.  Sampling and expenditure weights shall be included in order to aggregate measures both nationally and per local market for individual food products and aggregated food groups.In order to undertake the research that is planned, The contractor is required to provide a complete description of sample design. In addition to sample weights, other relevant data (such as strata and clusters) shall be included.2.	A data description dictionary that provides a full explanation of any abbreviated terms in the data and a listing of all the available common characteristics for categories within each department shall be included in the delivered package For each transaction observation the contractor shall provide all relevant information regarding the transaction as well as all available information on the product purchased and the household that purchased the product (see below).3.  The contractor shall provide analytical support for 1 to 4 special requests based on the specific needs of ERS at that time.  These analyses will provide ERS with the ability to quickly obtain attitude, health, and knowledge information from household panel participants through both current existing data and customized survey questions used to collect new data.  Acceptance standards will be clarified for each request for analysis at the time of the request. ** Due Date for the above tasks is:  September 01, 2004

<DESC>ARCHITECT-ENGINEER SERVICES. Solicitation GS-09P-04-KTC-0073  for the new construction for an FBI Agency Campus to be located on 11000 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, CA. Response Due Date:  August 13, 2004 at 4:00 PM to:
General Services Administration, Property Development Division, 9PCE, 450 Golden Gate Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102. Point of contact: Constance Russell, Contracting Officer, telephone (415) 522-3130, facsimile (415) 522-3116.
The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Public Architecture and is seeking an Architect-Engineering (A-E) design team for the new construction for an FBI Agency Campus to be located on 11000 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, CA. 
The new construction includes a mid-rise building for office and library storage space; a special maintenance facility and parking structure located in the southwest corner within the existing 28-acre Government site in west Los Angeles bounded by I-405 and Wilshire Boulevard.  These buildings will be located across from the existing 18-story Federal Building.
Upon project completion, the Agency will have approximately 228,000 gsf of office space, 190,000 gsf of library style storage (convertible to office space), a 47,000 Automotive Radio Maintenance Facility (AMRF), secured parking lot for 815 cars in addition to the existing 600-vehicle parking structure, and a secure barrier around the campus to meet current security standards.
These new facilities will conform to the latest building codes, but not limited to the  most current seismic standards, security requirements including blast mitigation and progressive collapse mitigation, utility systems, fire safety, and Americans with Disabilities Act.
The estimated total construction cost is between $140,000,000 and $160,000,000.  The overall design and construction project will have a contract completion period of approximately five years.


The Base A/E Services contract will include Pre-Design, Preliminary Concepts, and Final Concept phases.  At the end of the Base Contract, the Government will determine the procurement method, (i.e. traditional design/bid/build, bridging design/build, etc.) based upon economic times and funding conditions.  The Government reserves the right to exercise the options for Design Development, Procurement Construction Documents and Construction Phase Services. 
The scope of the A-E Services under this Firm-Fixed Price Contract may include but is not limited to the following: Pre-design services including special studies and surveys, schematics design, design development, preparation of working drawings and contract documents to be completed in AUTOCAD, specifications, estimating services, value engineering, post construction award services and other supplemental services as appropriate to the project needs.
The Selection is comprised of two stages as follows:
Stage 1: This stage will establish the Design Excellence capability of the A-E design firm and its lead designer.  The lead designer is the individual of the design firm who will have the primary responsibility for the design.  This individual is employed by the A-E design firm, partnership, corporation, association or other legal entity which will have contractual responsibility for project design.  In this first stage, a minimum of three A-E firms will be “short listed” based upon the firms’ submittals in response to this Request for Qualification (RFQ).  Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the evaluation criteria listed below.  In addition, the A-E design firm shall submit a firm profile that is no longer than two typewritten pages (using standard 12-font double spaced text) that describes the overall history of the firm, general design philosophy to projects, and the firm’s organizational make-up that supports the design process.
The following items will serve as Evaluation Criteria in descending order of importance:
1)	Past Performance on Design: The A-E design firm shall submit a portfolio of up to five comparable projects completed by the firm within the past ten years; include a maximum of two typewritten pages per project describing design objectives, approach, results, project significance, key features, awards and up to three illustrations (no larger 8x10 inches each) for each project to indicate visual evidence of design quality.  The narrative shall discuss how the client’s design, economic and operational objectives were satisfied by the design.
2)	Philosophy and Design Intent: The A-E design firm shall submit a statement of intent written by the lead designer in a maximum of two typewritten pages indicating overall design philosophy, understanding of design issues, approaches and solutions specifically to new construction. 
3)	Lead Designers(s) Portfolio(s): Submit a description of two designs completed within the past ten years by each designer with a maximum one page per project.  Narratives shall include a discussion of design challenges and solutions.
4)	Lead Designer(s) Profile(s): Submit biographical sketch(es) including education, professional experience, and recognition for design efforts for similar projects for the lead designer(s) and other key individuals including the design principal, project designer and project manager; identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to this project.  One of the goals of this project is to develop an award winning design that meets the project’s programming and budget parameters.  In addition, appropriate and cost-effective integration of sustainable design principles will be required.  Formal LEED certification as outlined by U.S. Green Building may be pursued dependent upon project budget.  Nonetheless, LEED 2.0 criteria will still be used as one of the tools in developing a successful design solution for this project.  Therefore, in addition to aesthetic design excellence, the demonstration of successful integration of sustainable practices will also be evaluated.
Stage 2:  In this stage, the entire project team for each A-E design firm selected in Stage 1 including the designated lead designer and consultants who will work on this project will be evaluated.  The short listed A-E design firms will submit Standard Form 330  for the entire project team for the final selection process.  Sufficient time (30-days) will be provided to the A-E design firms to establish project teams.  Information shall be provided to describe the team’s capabilities and accomplishments with an emphasis on the projects that the team has collaborated on previously.
Consideration for selection will be based on the following criteria:
1)	Proposed Project Team:  Key personnel background and qualifications including previous relevant experience.
2)	Project Management:  Proposed project planning, scheduling, team coordination, cost control methods, quality control methods and production facilities.
3)	Design Experience:  Visual and narrative evidence of the proposed team’s design capability with respect to new construction.
4)	Construction Experience:  Experience on projects with similar size and scope; with GSA and/or other Government design contracts including experience with Federal Government regulations, specifications, evidence of effectiveness and ability to coordinate with Federal authorities.
The Government will establish the date these Stage 2 submittals are due and provide selection criteria for the interviews and final selection process in conjunction with the Stage 1 short list announcement.
Consideration is limited to firms having an active design production office in the State of California.   A joint venture and/or a firm/consultant arrangement will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of members to provide a quality effort.  The key firm of any proposed joint venture and/or firm/ consultant arrangement must have an existing active office within the designated Geographical limit.   35% of the work effort must be in the State and the firm must demonstrate the capability to perform all contract services.
The procurement is open to both large and small business under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Before the award of the contract the selected firm shall be required to present an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, GSA has established national subcontracting goals of 40% for Small Business and 5% for Disadvantage Businesses, 5% for Small Women-Owned Businesses, 3% for Small Veteran-owned Businesses and 2% for HUB Zone Businesses.  In support of the Agency’s effort, firms seeking consideration for this contract shall demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the above goals.
Although this procurement is open to large businesses, small and minority firms are encouraged to participate.  The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller firms and encourages the contributions of new and innovative designers to public architecture.  Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or members of joint ventures with other small businesses.  All interested contractors are reminded that the successful contractor will be expected to place subcontracts to a maximum extent practical with small and disadvantaged firms as part of their original submitted teams.  Before award of the contract the A-E (if not a small business having an average gross receipts of less than $4M during each of the past three fiscal years) is required to submit an acceptable Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan as mentioned previously.
Offerors are invited to attend a pre-submittal conference to discuss project requirements and the selection process.  The conference will be held in the Nevada/California Room, 2nd floor at the Federal Building at 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, CA on August 3, 2004 at 10:00 am.  Offerors are requested to notify the Contract Specialist, Shelita Harper by calling 415-522-3206 or via email to shelita.harper@gsa.gov regarding the name of attendees.  This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP).  Any inquiries or submittals should reference solicitation number GS-09P-04-KTC-0073.  Interested A-E firms or joint ventures having qualifications to meet these requirements are invited to submit six copies of requested qualifications as addressed in Stage 1 of this announcement along with a letter of interest not later than 4:00 pm (PST), August 13, 2004 to:

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  	This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) was originally posted on 24 June 2004 as a Special Notice.  The purpose of this posting is to also post the BAA as a Presolicitation Notice and to modify and extend the registration and security clearance/visitor requests and confirmation dates for the Torpedo Advanced Processor Build (APB) Program and Related Topics Industry Day to be held on 21 July 2004 at the Naval Underse a Warfare Center (NUWC) Division Newport.  Registration requests and security clearance/visitor requests for Industry Day attendance should now be received not later than 16 July 2004 and registration requests will be confirmed by 20 July 2004.  Note that no other dates contained in the original 24 June 2004 BAA Special Notice posting have been changed.  The entire BAA is restated below, with only the above-mentioned changes incorporated. This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  Any resulting contractual agreements based on responses to the BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law (PL) 98-369, “The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.”  A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional inf ormation regarding this announcement will not be issued.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this announcement is 541710 with a small business size standard of 500. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will not issue paper copies of this announcement. NAVSEA reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement. NAVSEA reserves the right to fund all, some or none of the proposals received under this BAA. NAVSEA provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.             Undersea Weapons Program Office (PMS404), Washington Navy Yard, Washington DC, is soliciting for research proposals that will aggressively incorporate flexible, affordable, and innovative  torpedo signal processing control beyond its current baseline.  The mission of the Torpedo Advanced Processor Build  (APB) Program is to address rapidly changing technology and constantly evolving threats necessitating the need to redefine the methodology for producing torpedo modifications. The need to identify weapon system shortfalls, select the best solutions, and establish proper feedback processes and tools to enable a data-driven, build-test-build approach to continually improve system performance is crucial.  Primarily, the project’s scope will be defined by the development of torpedo signal processing algorithms involving signal processing, signal detection, signal classification and waveform design. The project will also address Weapon Control improvements and support tasks including combat system interface, communication interface control, transmit waveform control  and internal torpedo communication functions. These tasks support the overall torpedo functionality.  The endstate to the proposed Torpedo APB Program will be the ability to maintain our undersea weapon advantage and thus ensuring maritime access and battle space superiority.  As an introduction to this new process, the Government will host a classified, to the Secret level,  Torpedo APB Program and Related Topics Industry Day.  Interested representatives of Government and Industry are encouraged to attend on Wednesday, 21 July 2004.  No foreign participation is allowed.  The briefing will be held at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division Newport from 8am until 5pm.  General questions about Industry Day should be addressed to Mark Campbell at (401) 832-8080 and detailed questions concerning this BAA or the Torpedo APB program must be submitted electronically to Rich ard D. Braendel II, SEA 02613B, at BraendelR@navsea.navy.mil.  Organizations wishing to send representatives should register via e-mail, by fax or in writing to the following addresses:  Email: campbellma@npt.nuwc.navy.mil Fax: 	(401) 832-1134 Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport Mark Campbell Code 8191, Building 990/2 1176 Howell Street Newport, RI 02841-1708 Information regarding security clearance/visit request and hotel information can be found at: http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil under Visitor Information. Attendance is limited to persons who have registered and have approved security clearances in place. Registration requests and security clearance/visitor requests should be received not later than 16 July 2004.  Registration requests will be confirmed by 20 July 2004. The scope of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and the proposals solicited  are limited and will be used for identifying innovative algorithm processing techniques for future detailed development.  The Navy intends to award up to three (3) preliminary Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) studies, not-to-exceed (NTE) $100K each, from a total BAA budget of $300K.  However, the Navy reserves the right to award more, less or no studies as a result of this BAA.  Awards will be based on the merits of the proposals as evaluated by the Torpedo APB evaluation team.  Depending upon the success of the studies the potential exists for follow-on development contract awards.

The Offeror shall also provide a point of contact, to include name, title, phone number and email address, at their cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). The evaluation of proposals will be performed by the cognizant Program Officer and other naval and defense activities/agencies personnel, including the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Newport division, as needed.  All evaluation team members will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information. Due to NUWC Newport’s participation in the evaluation of proposals, and in order to avoid any potential conflicts of interest, proposals from the Naval Undersea Warfare Center will not be accepted or considered for award. Evaluation of proposals will be based on  the following criteria: ·	To what degree does the proposal demonstrate potential for improving signal and weapon processing control beyond the current torpedo processing baseline (Block IV)? ·	Can the proposed study/development be completed in time to support the Torpedo APB schedule? ·	What is the probability that the proposed study effort will meet the objectives stated in the Offeror’s proposal? ·	Does the proposed study effort appear to be realistically achievable with the funds requested? ·	To what degree will the benefits of the proposed study effort be limited by restrictive data rights provisions or limited distribution of data? ·	What has been the Offeror’s past performance in signal processing algorithm enhancements and weapon control improvements? These criteria are in descending order of importance for evaluation purposes with the first three being signi ficantly more important than the other evaluation criteria. At the conclusion of the evaluation, Offeror(s) will be notified, as applicable, that: 1) its proposal has been accepted for negotiation, 2) its proposal has been accepted pending the availability of funds, or 3) its proposal has not been accepted.  NAVSEA will retain and file one copy of non-accepted proposals; all other copies of non-accepted proposals will be destroyed.  Those proposals accepted pending the availability of funds may be considered for funding for up to twelve months after the closing date of this BAA.  Not all proposals evaluated as acceptable will be funded.  Decisions to fund acceptable proposals will be based on funds available and the evaluation criteria set forth in this document.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Statistical Research and Applications Branch (SRAB) intends on contracting on a sole source basis with Istituto Superiore di SanitàLab. Epidemiologia e Biostatistica, Reparto Indicatori Sorveglianza Sanitaria, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Roma, Italy for:  Combined Incidence and Prevalence Estimates in US at State Level for All Cancer Sites.  The services and supplies herein are being procured using the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The statistical method denoted MIAMOD (Mortality Incidence Analysis MODel) has been developed by researchers from the Instituto Superiore di Sanità in Rome, Italy.  The MIAMOD method involves modeling incidence as an age, period and cohort (APC) model over a relatively long observation period and back-calculating it from cancer mortality and survival.  Then prevalence is forward calculated using incidence and survival.  MIAMOD allows one to extrapolate incidence and prevalence to areas where only mortality and survival are available.  PIAMOD (Prevalence Incidence Analysis MODel) is an alternative method to estimate prevalence which uses cancer incidence and cancer survival data.  In PIAMOD observed incidence is directly modeled as an APC model.  Prevalence is obtained in a similar way as in the MIAMOD method from the estimated and projected incidence.  A pilot study "Projection of breast cancer incidence and prevalence in US at state level" currently under contract investigates the performance of the PIAMOD/MIAMOD methodology in estimating breast cancer prevalence at state level. The Statistical Research and Applications Branch in the DCCPS at NCI, is interested in obtaining estimates of cancer prevalence at the state level for all cancer sites combined.  The Istituto Superiore di Sanità under the direction of Dr. Roberta De Angelis will be responsible for managing and conducting the research.  Dr. De Angelis and her team of researchers are leading experts in the development of the methods and application for estimating chronic diseases incidence and prevalence.  They developed the software (MIAMOD/PIAMOD) necessary to calculate the required incidence and prevalence data. The software has also been extensively applied to cancer data from Italy, Europe, and the U.S.  The Istituto Superiore di Sanità is the only source known to NCI with its unique capabilities to successfully complete this project.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if he party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM, EST on July 28, 2004.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Acquisitions Management and Operations Branch (AMOB) intends to award a sole source contract for data management support to The EMMES Corporation of Rockville, MD.  NIAID intends to award a one year contract with the option for two additional years beginning on or before September 30, 2004.  The resulting contract will also contain the provision at FAR 52.217-8.  The contractor will be responsible for providing data management support for the VRC Clinical Trials Core.  EMMES has performed as the sole compiler and processor of all comprehensive clinical data collected for all currently ongoing Phase I clinical trials carried out by the VRC Clinical Trials Core.  This data management function is essential to ensure that the results of clinical trials of novel vaccine strategies can be rapidly and efficiently analyzed at study completion, and to permit frequent review of interim safety and accrual data during conduct of a clinical trial.  This comprehensive data management is essential for accomplishment of VRC clinical research goals and to meet Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR312) requirements for the proper conduct of the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the Investigational New Drug applications for new vaccine products.  The current Phase I clinical trials have been initiated using EMMES Internet Data Entry System (IDES), and must be completed using the same protocols to preserve these trials' utility for ultimate licensure of candidate vaccines.  It is not possible to transfer these trial data management functions to another contractor without restarting clinical trials from their inception, a step that would impose a loss of several years time in the development process to achieving an effective HIV/AIDS vaccine.  Please refer any questions in writing to Terrie Nestor at tnestor@niaid.nih.gov by August 27, 2004 at 2:00 pm EDT.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC/WFF has a requirement for aircraft support for an Airborne Remote Sensing Campaign over sites in Antarctica and Chile scheduled to occur between November 1 and December 6, 2004.  This aircraft support will be provided in concert with an existing Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and the Centro de Estudios Cientificos (CECS) for a joint scientific study of the Antarctic ice fields. NASA/GSFC/WFF intends to purchase this service on a non-competetive basis in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)-"Only One Responsible Source" from CECS, Valdivia, Chile.  For the last 15 years, NASA's Arctic Ice Mapping Project has been operating remote sensing instrumentation over ice-covered regions in order to study Cryospheric Science and related effects of Global Climate Change.  The instrumentation required for the field campaign in Antarctica and Patagonia is designed to mount only on a P3 aircraft, therefore a P3 is required for the campaign.  Specifically there are special antennas required for an Ice Penetrating Radar that must be mounted to the wings of the remote sensing platform.  These antennas have been designed and constructed to fasten to existing hard points of a P3.  Use of any other type of aircraft would incur excessive cost and time associated with flight recertification following installation of these antennas. It may be necessary to operate the aircraft over sensitive Chilean air space, and as such, only a Chilean aircraft will be permitted in some of the important survey areas.  The base of operation for this project will be Punta Arenas, Chile, which is the closest major airport to the sites of interest in Antarctica.  As such, an aircraft operated by the Chilean government will offer the needed flexibility.  Pilots with experience with the often-unfavorable flight conditions in the region south of Punta Arenas and in Patagonia are required, and the Chilean Navy pilots who will be provided through an existing contract with CECS are among the most experienced in the world in such conditions.  The source must also be capable of meeting NASA aircraft safety requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 28, 2004.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES  PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-04-00338.  It is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990, with a small business size standard of $6 million.  The  Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement for "Source Apportionment of PM2.5 in Seattle using STN and IMPROVE carbon fractions."  The U.S. EPA National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) evaluates and develops receptor models that are used to identify and quantify sources of air pollution.   These models help state and local air pollution agencies develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for reducing concentrations of regulated pollutants. The Speciation Trends Network (STN) and the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network are two national networks  collecting data useful for evaluating particulate air pollution composition.  The IMPROVE sites are generally located in wilderness areas and the STN sites are generally located in urban areas.  These two networks use different thermal optical analysis (TOA) protocols to estimate concentrations of  particulate organic and elemental carbon. The IMPROVE protocol reports four organic carbon (OC),  3 elemental carbon (EC), and  a pyrolized carbon fractions.  The STN protocol routinely reports one value for OC and EC, however, carbon fraction data are generated as part of the TOA by the analyzer  software package.  The IMPROVE OC and EC carbon fractions were used by Maykut et al. (2003) to evaluate the Seattle (Beacon Hill) IMPROVE particulate matter data collected from March 1996 to February 1999 using 3 receptor models: Chemical Mass Balance, Unmix, and Positive Matrix Factorization  (PMF).  The PMF model was able to separate diesel and gasoline source profiles with and without the carbon fractions but several inorganic species were critical for the separation.  Alternatively, the Unmix model required the carbon fractions to separate the diesel and gasoline profiles.  The  Seattle IMPROVE site is unique because it is located in an urban area and it is also an STN site (started in February 2000), thus it is a location where the results from using the STN and IMPROVE carbon fractions in receptor models can be compared and contrasted.   Statement of Work - The  contractor shall provide a plan addressing quality assurance for the receptor modeling analyses.  This plan shall meet the requirements for a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for an EPA Category IV research project (basic, exploratory research). EPA has obtained the Seattle STN TOA carbon  fraction data for February 15, 2000 through December 31, 2002.  The contractor shall evaluate three combinations of the IMPROVE and STN inorganic and carbon fraction data with EPA Unmix 3.0 and PMF2 to determine if the STN carbon fraction data are useful in a receptor modeling analysis.  The  contractor shall: 1) compare the results in Maykut et al. (March 1996 - February 1999) with this more recent data set (February 2000 - December 2002) using IMPROVE inorganic species and IMPROVE carbon fractions, 2) determine if the STN carbon fraction data provides similar receptor modeling results  using the IMPROVE inorganic species data with STN carbon fraction data , and 3) determine if biases in the STN and IMPROVE inorganic data affect the results from the analysis of the second data set using the STN inorganic species combined with STN carbon fractions. The contractor shall provide the  Seattle IMPROVE data and the PMF2 receptor model.  EPA will provide the following STN TOA data: sample ID, organic carbon (OC) ( ug/sq cm), OC uncertainty (ug/sq cm), elemental carbon (EC) (ug/sq cm), EC uncertainty (ug/sq cm), carbonate carbon (CC) (ug/sq cm), CC uncertainty (ug/sq cm), total  carbon (TC) (ug/sq cm),  TC uncertainty (ug/sq cm), EC/TC ratio, split time(sec), initial absorbance, absorbance coefficient, peak 1 concentration (C ug/sq cm), peak 2 concentration (C ug/sq cm), peak 3 concentration (C ug/sq cm),  peak 4 concentration (C ug/sq cm), and pyrolized carbon (ug/sq cm).   EPA will also provide a data file with the sample ID, sample date, sample volume, deposit area, and STN quartz sample quality assurance flags.  EPA will also provide the inorganic Seattle STN data and the EPA Unmix 3.0 receptor model.  The contractor shall review available documentation on the  Technology Transfer Network Ambient Monitoring Technology Information Center (http://www.epa.gov/ttnamti1/pmspec.html) to identify issues with STN data before conducting the receptor modeling.  TASK 1 - The contractor shall provide a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for the creation of the  data sets, receptor modeling analysis, and comparison of modeling results.  The contractor shall provide to the EPA a written plan in electronic format (Microsoft Word) describing the quality assurance procedures (see Guidance for Quality Assurance Project Plans for Modeling EPA QA/G-5M,  EPA/240/R-02/007, Dec 2002; http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/g5m-final.pdf).The contractor shall prepare a plan that describes: a) references for theories/techniques/methodologies that will be used, b) data pre-processing and QA to be performed when creating the data sets, c) methods to be used  when selecting variables and observations for the receptor modeling analyses, d) procedures to be used for ensuring that the model results are accurate and complete, and e) techniques that will be used to evaluate the results from multiple receptor models and multiple data sets.  TASK 2 -  The  contractor shall create three data sets: Seattle IMPROVE inorganic and carbon fractions,  IMPROVE inorganic and STN carbon fractions, and STN inorganic and carbon fractions.  TASK 3 - The contractor shall evaluate each of the data sets created in Task 2  with PMF2 and EPA Unmix 3.0.  TASK 4 - The  contractor shall prepare a report describing the results from Task 3, and compare the results to those presented in Maykut et al. 2003.  The results shall include estimates of uncertainty on the source profiles and on the average contribution from each source.  Comparisons shall take these  uncertainties into account.  The contractor shall provide all text and tables in Microsoft Word, and all figures shall be provided as Sigma Plot graphics files. [END OF TASKS]  Deliverables are as follows:  Deliverable 1 - QAPP - Deliverable date: 3 months after contract is awarded.

Boneless beef and boneless beef destined for ground beef suppliers under contract with AMS, must meet presence-only and quantification level microbiological requirements.  In addition, the finished beef products must meet specified fat content requirements (target, upper and lower specification levels).  The boneless beef and ground beef suppliers are required to meet statistical process control (SPC), centered process capability (Cpk/Cpu), requirements for the specified microbiological quantification levels and fat content.  The need for timely and accurate laboratory sample results and analysis of the results is critical to AMS and to AMS suppliers.

All results and other information will be supplied simultaneously to AMS and AMS contracted boneless beef suppliers or suppliers of boneless beef destined for AMS contracted ground beef.  Laboratories shall be a third party independent laboratory and not owned by companies that are or may be involved in meat procurement contracts with AMS.  Laboratories will need to submit a detailed technical proposal addressing all of the AMS requirements listed below for review.  After submission of a satisfactory technical proposal, the laboratory must successfully complete an onsite capability assessment by AMS to be eligible to receive an award under the service contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This amendment extends the date and time for receipt of proposals to 2:00 P.M. EST Monday, July 19, 2004 and provides questions received by 4:00 P.M.Thursday, July 8, 2004 along with the respective answers. All Proposals must be mailed to the Procurement Office at Office of Thrift Supervision, 1700 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20552. Due to carpet sample requirements, fax and email proposals will not be accepted.  Question 1: Does solution dyed meet the requirements for yarn dyed. Answer: Yes. Solution dyed meets the requirement Question 2: GSA- Is this going to be GSA purchased or supply and install by contractor Answer: The contractor is required to supply and install the carpet. Question 3: Color or pattern.  Is this a design around match existing or a new design Answer:  There is no need to match or work around existing carpet or patterns. The intent is for entirely new color and/or pattern. Question 4: What is the overage allowance on the carpet Answer: The quantities specified by OTS include approximately 43, 500 square feet of additional uninstalled carpet for future use. Allowance variation in quantity is 5 percent. Question 5: Will carpet be in one drop, or as needed Answer: Material is to be delivered as needed to project site in original, undamaged packages and containers, labeled with identification of manufacturer, brand name, and lot number. Question 6: Will there be space for all carpet to be stored on site Answer:  No. The successful offeror must store materials off-site in original, undamaged packages and containers, inside well-ventilated area that is protected from weather, moisture, soilage, extreme temperature, and humidity. Question 7: Would you consider purchasing broadloam rolled carpet bids for this project. We have Kraus Carpet on the GSA Schedule Contract Number GS-27F-0021A Answer: No. Question 8: Can I have a site visit  Answer: OTS conducted a site visit July 1, 2004 at 10:00 A.M. No other site visits will be conducted.  Question 9:  Will blueprints/ floor plans be available at the site visit  Answer: Blueprints/floor plans were provided during the site visit.  Question 10: When are sample submissions due  Answer: A sample any color is due with each proposal. Color samples will be required from the successful offeror prior to award.  Question 11: Is there a minimum face weight requirement for the carpet  Answer: The minimum acceptable face weight is 28 oz. Question 12: Can I quote to furnish the carpet only within your solicitation without quoting on the installation component Answer: No. OTS is seeking a turnkey solution requiring both carpet and installation.  Question 13:  Surface Texture. Most loop carpets are not a pure level loop. There is a slight texture which helps in seamability. Is a loop texture pile acceptable  Answer: Loop texture is acceptable.  Question 14: Appearance Retention. Since nylon carpet does not wear out but can lose its appearance, carpet manufacturers with the assistance of Federal customers has developed a process to help project the appearance of the carpet over its life. The Appetence Retention Rating-CRI TM101 rates products as moderate, heavy, and severe. This concept is part of the GSA guide specification.  Is it acceptable to offer and recommend active work areas as needing a severe rating  Answer: It is acceptable. Question 15: What would be the estimated start date Answer: Carpet should be ordered immediately after award.  Installation should begin as soon as possible once received -- OTS requires two weeks notice prior to start of installation.  Question 16: "A storage area within the facility will be provided for the carpet" Typically a tractor trailer holds in excess of 4000 SY's. Based on our experience in occupied space installations it is unlikely that an area exists that would hold 4000 + Square Yards within the building much less an excess of 186,000 Square Feet 20,666SY's Answer: Please note that the storage area is intended to house only materials needed for a few days at a time.  Material is to be delivered as needed to project site in original factory wrappings and containers, labeled with identification of manufacturer, brand name, and lot number.  Successful offeror must store materials off-site in original, undamaged packages and containers, inside well-ventilated area that is protected from weather, moisture, soilage, extreme temperature, and humidity. Question 17:  Please provide specifics on the Storage Area that will be available i.e. approximate room size and specifics on proximity to loading dock. Additionally is there double door access from dock to storage area. In comment to above typically a standard 25 foot delivery truck used in redelivery of Full Loads will hold about 14 pallets of carpet tile. Hence a minimum storage would be able to accommodate 14 to 18 pallets Answer: The storage area will be open space immediately adjacent to the loading dock freight elevator on the basement level.  There are double doors leading from the freight elevator to this area.  In addition, there is space on each floor to stage pallets of carpet tiles. Question 18:  What is the loading dock height restriction  Is a dock leveler or Plate available Answer:  The loading dock has a height restriction of 13 feet. There is a dock plate available. Question 19: Are there any internal security requirements that will need to be addressed other than the one's mentioned in the solicitation. Are escorts required and if so at who's expense. After initial processing of our technicians will badges be issued granting reasonable unrestricted access Answer: OTS Security will monitor installers at OTS’ expense.  Technicians will be issued badges that will permit access to the facility for the duration of the project.  Question 20: Will space be available for placement of a 30 Yard dumpster in proximity to the loading dock (typically they measure 22'L x 8'W x 6'H) Note on above: It is infinitely more cost effective to utilize a dumpster which will hold from 4 to 6 production days rather than have take up and waste removed daily Answer: Yes. Question 21: Will there be minimally accepted production rates for an evenings shift or phase. By example our standard production rate is in excess of 300 SY's nightly which would allow for completion of the project in a 7 to 8 week timeframe Answer: It is anticipated that each proposal will address production rates and an installation plan.  That information will be assessed as part of the evaluation process.  At a minimum, OTS will require a schedule that identifies which areas will be carpeted each evening so that impacted office occupants can be advised.  The schedule will be required at least one week in advance for each area Question 22: Within your specification there is mention of a Pre-Applied adhesive system Some manufacture's require application of a primer prior to installation of there Pre-Applied adhesive. Is primer a condition of the carpet tile referred to in the solicitation Answer: If proposing a carpet where the manufacturer requires a primer prior to installation, a primer must be applied.  Question 23:  Indicated is the purchase of 186,000 SF 20,666 Square Yards with an installed quantity of 142,500 SF 15,833 Square Yards Based on our experience that leaves an incredible amount of Attic Stock. In excess of a tractor Full.  Is it your intent to have in excess of 4000 SY's of attic stock. If so please provide your requirement for this material at project end. Do we need to warehouse it for you and if so for how long or is there a facility we should redeliver it to. Comment on above: Industry practices for attic stock are generally 2 percent to 3 percent of the installed yardage or between 300 to 400 Square Yards Answer: Yes – it is OTS’ intent to have the excess amount of carpet stated.  OTS will be prepared to receive the excess stock immediately after all installation has been completed.  Question 24: Your solicitation indicates an installed quantity of 142,500 SF 15,833 SY's Having completed a Take off using the plans provided we have determined this quantity is in excess by over 1000 SY's than the material required to cover the floor based on the project scope. Should we respond using your quantity determinations or ours Answer: Please respond with both. An architectural firm projected carpet quantities but OTS will consider other quantities based on offeror’s calculations. If offerors determine that the required amount is more or less than stated, please address pricing for the revised amount keeping the same quantity of attic stock specified. Question 25: Realizing this is occupied space to what extent are you planning to prepare the areas for installation. Will computers be left in place, office contents, phones Etc. Comment on above: As occupied Space specialists with our process computers phones and office workstation contents remain in place Answer: Installation plans that address the type and amount of office preparation required should be included as part of the proposal and will be evaluated by OTS.  A goal is to minimize the disruption to our staff to the extent possible and to ensure that all offices are available for use during business hours.  NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

The June 3rd notice advised that the procurement would be a partial set-aside for small business and that the resulting awards would be time-and-materials contracts.

If there are not enough qualified small business sources to compete for both contracts, EPA will amend the RFP to initiate an unrestricted competition for the second contract.  The deadline for submitting proposals for an unrestricted competition would be 30 days after the RFP is amended.  The small business selected for the set-aside award would not be eligible to receive the unrestricted award. The RFP will be available on the EPA website http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm after this notice is posted.  The resultant contract will be fixed rate indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, with an estimated value between $200,000,000 and $250,000,000 over a 60-month period of performance.  The labor hour utilization is not expected to exceed 186,700 regular hours and 41,200 overtime hours over the 60-month period of performance. The NAICS code for this procurement is 562910. Please do not submit proposals in response to this announcement. Please direct any questions to Tanya Hoston at hoston.tanya@epa.gov or 202-564-0996 or Carolyn Rossmann at rossmann.carolyn@epa.gov or 202-564-2669.

<DESC>This hereby amends this solicitation to address technical questions.

QUESTION:
Are there any requirements for cable length from the actuator to the controller?
ANSWER:
The cable should be at least 2 feet long.

QUESTION:
Are there any restrictions on the location on the actuator where the cable enters?
ANSWER:
Anywhere on the left-hand edge of the drawing.

QUESTION:
Are there any surface finish requirements?
ANSWER:
Anodization is preferred.

QUESTION:
What material should be used? 
ANSWER:
Aluminum

QUESTION:
What is the allowable height for the actuator?
ANSWER:
More than 3" would be difficult to accommodate.

QUESTION:
What are your linearity, repeatability and hysteresis specifications?
ANSWER:
This is being used for optical spectroscopy, so with closed-loop motion control, linearity and hysteresis specifications are easily met.  Of course, we will require a calibration curve for the output of the position indicator, good to within plus or minus 5 nm over the entire range of motion.

QUESTION:
Is there a specification for the small step settling time?
ANSWER:
Something on the order of a few milliseconds.

QUESTION:
Please provide a description of how this actuator will be used? Will it be used for static or dynamic positioning?
ANSWER:
Its primary intended use will be for static positioning.  It is possible that it will be necessary to press it into service for dynamic positioning.  If the dynamic positioning becomes necessary, we envision applying a triangle drive waveform with the high-frequency components filtered out.

All other terms and conditions of this solicitation remain unchanged.

<DESC>The Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technololgy (JPL/Caltech) operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Adminstration (NASA), issues this RFI to solicit interest and responses to provide for the design and construction of a large thermal vacuum chamber and its associated support systems for testing of large interferometer instruments at JPL as well as the impact such a facility would have on lab-wide resources/infrastructure. The RFI will present a series of questions that will be used to determine the qualifications of prospective vendors. This notice is posted for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition. BACKGROUND Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is interested in having a large thermal vacuum test facility constructed that would support the design, fabrication, integration and testing of large interferometer instruments before they are launched into space. This new facility would include a large, ultra clean thermal vacuum chamber with vibration isolation for testing the interferometers in a simulated deep space environment. The first mission to use this facility will require the vacuum chamber to be fully operational by July 2008. PURPOSE The first phase of this chamber project is to obtain a preliminary design, preliminary cost information and a preliminary construction schedule and to this end JPL needs to determine if there are qualified vendors who can undertake a project of this nature. JPL may award up to three preliminary design study contracts. From these three JPL will down-select the chamber design contractor. JPL is already working with an Architect-Engineering (A-E) firm on the design of the building to house this chamber. It is expected that the chamber designer will work in conjunction with the A-E firm. BASIC REQUIREMENTS The primary components to be provided for this turnkey facility are: (a) Vacuum Chamber (with provisions for future additions); (b) Vacuum Chamber Foundation Design; (c) Test Article Handling System; (d) Vacuum Pumping System (roughing and high vacuum); (e) Thermal Shroud; (f) LN2 Thermal System; (g) GN2 Thermal System; (h) Re-pressurization and Ventilation Systems; (i) LN2 Storage; (j) GN2 Storage and Supply System; (k) Control System; (l) Vibration Isolation System; and (m) Building to house the major portion of the chamber, chamber support equipment and control room. The initial interferometer will require a vacuum chamber working area of approximately 25 feet (8 meters) wide by 25 (8 meters) feet high by 40 feet (12 meters) long and must be tested in a horizontal configuration. Temperature range will be from –185OC to +130OC.  Future interferometers will require testing in a vertical configuration and will need an envelope of approximately 120 feet (37 meters) high by 40 feet (12 meters) in diameter. The instrument will require vibration isolation with a spectral density on the top surface of the support system is to be better than 2-5x10 -6 g 2/Hz over a frequency band of 20-400 Hz peaking at 250 Hz. Specific performance criteria including maximum differential displacements of the support pads, both angular and/or linear, are TBD. The alignment stability of the support pads shall be less than 50 nano-radians during a five (5) minute test period with the pads loaded with a 10,000 pound test article considering all sources of vibration input and thermal input. The facility will also require test article handling and transfer capability, facility operational instrumentation and control systems. QUESTIONS FOR POTENTIAL VENDORS 1. Does your organization have the capability to build this kind of thermal vacuum facility? Are you willing to supply preliminary information about the chamber design, development schedule, and estimated cost if your organization is selected to do a preliminary design study? 2. Describe your experience in the design, fabrication, installation, and commissioning of similar thermal vacuum facilities. Provide the names of previous relevant customers.  3. Will you undertake this project alone or will you be teaming with others? If teaming, provide the name of the Prime Contractor and a list of major Subcontractors along with their relevant experience in this type of project.  4. This project is estimated to be $20M-$45M. Are you (your team) capable of being bonded for a project of this size? If yes, please provide evidence of this capability. Please refer to:		http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570/c570.html#certified      for a list of certified surety companies. RESPONSES Prospective vendors are invited to submit responses to: JPL, Attn: Christine Horowitz, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, M/S 190-220, Pasadena, California 91109-8099 no later than July 23, 2004 at 3:00 p.m. PDT. When responding reference Solicitation #CH-04-01.  DISCLAIMER This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.	Respondents will not be notified of the results. JPL is under no obligation to issue any contracts as a result of this Request for Information. Potential contractors shall not be reimbursed for any costs associated with the preparation of this Request for Information. Should a contract be issued, there shall be no allowance for work performed or costs incurred prior to the execution of the contract. Prospective subcontractors are advised that any information provided shall be deemed to be furnished with unlimited rights to JPL, with JPL assuming no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data.

<CONTACT>Ellen McDaniel 8128545315
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) conducts research and development directed towards demilitarization of munitions.  NSWC Crane is interested in receiving innovative proposals for new/improved technologies to demilitarize munitions and munition components in a safe and environmentally friendly manner.  The technical areas of interest are in the areas of disassembly, removal, resource recovery and reuse (R3), destruction and waste stream treatment.  Proposals may be for scientific studies and experimentations directed towards advancing the state-of-the-art, pilot scale studies or prototype scale demonstrations. This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102 (d)(2).  It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of three years from the date of publication.  Proposals may be submitted by an y non-governmental entity including commercial firms, institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such concerns.  NSWC Crane encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, Hub-zone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran owned small business and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions.  Typically each proposal may be (1) funded incrementally for periods up to three years subject to availability of appropriations; (2) funded between $10,000 to $10,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area; and (4) deliverables should demonstrate the resul ts of scientific study and experimentations.  Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding.  In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as a “white paper”).  This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks and a rough cost estimate.  Offerors should submit the white papers electronically. The white paper is to include a title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the proposed work.  The Government reserves the right to request a technical proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the  offerors submitting white papers.  Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission.  Offerors may submit full technical and cost proposals even if they did not submit a white paper or their white paper was not identified as promising.  The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail.  White papers (and proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria:   (1) Overall scientific, technical and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential relevance and contributions to the demilitarization technology area; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the demilitarization community are proposed and degree to which technical data and/or  computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to NSWC Crane with unrestricted (Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offeror’s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposed objectives and (6) Realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs (subject to the availability of funds).  These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED.  Any responsible business may submit a proposal .  White papers may be submitted at any time prior to expiration of the BAA.  Please send white papers and proposals via e-mail to McDaniel_e@crane.navy.mil or regular mail to Commander, ATTN:  Ms. Ellen McDaniel, Code 1162NZ, Building 64,  300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522-5011.  (Note: e-mail is preferred.)    Please refer to BAA Number N00164-04-R-4711 in all correspondence and communications.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) was originally posted on 24 June 2004.  The purpose of this posting is to modify and extend the registration and security clearance/visitor requests and confirmation dates for the Torpedo Advanced Processor Build (APB) Program and Related Topics Industry Day to be held on 21 July 2004 at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division Newport.  Registration requests and secu rity clearance/visitor requests for Industry Day attendance should now be received not later than 16 July 2004 and registration requests will be confirmed by 20 July 2004.  Note that no other dates contained in the original BAA posting have been changed.  As an administrative convenience, the entire BAA is restated below, with above-mentioned changes incorporated. This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  Any resulting contractual agreements based on responses to the BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law (PL) 98-369, “The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.”  A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.  The North American  Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this announcement is 541710 with a small business size standard of 500. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will not issue paper copies of this announcement. NAVSEA reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement. NAVSEA reserves the right to fund all, some or none of the proposals received under this BAA. NAVSEA provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.             Undersea Weapons Program Office (PMS404), Washington Navy Yard, Washington DC, is soliciting for research proposals that will aggressively incorporate flexible, affordable, and innovative torpedo signal processing control beyond its current baseline.  The mission  of the Torpedo Advanced Processor Build  (APB) Program is to address rapidly changing technology and constantly evolving threats necessitating the need to redefine the methodology for producing torpedo modifications. The need to identify weapon system shortfalls, select the best solutions, and establish proper feedback processes and tools to enable a data-driven, build-test-build approach to continually improve system performance is crucial.  Primarily, the project’s scope will be defined by the development of torpedo signal processing algorithms involving signal processing, signal detection, signal classification and waveform design. The project will also address Weapon Control improvements and support tasks including combat system interface, communication interface control, transmit waveform control and internal torpedo communication functions. These tasks support the overal l torpedo functionality.  The endstate to the proposed Torpedo APB Program will be the ability to maintain our undersea weapon advantage and thus ensuring maritime access and battle space superiority.  As an introduction to this new process, the Government will host a classified, to the Secret level,  Torpedo APB Program and Related Topics Industry Day.  Interested representatives of Government and Industry are encouraged to attend on Wednesday, 21 July 2004.  No foreign participation is allowed.  The briefing will be held at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division Newport from 8am until 5pm.  General questions about Industry Day should be addressed to Mark Campbell at (401) 832-8080 and detailed questions concerning this BAA or the Torpedo APB program must be submitted electronically to Richard D. Braendel II, SEA 02613B, at BraendelR@navsea.navy.mil.  Organizations  wishing to send representatives should register via e-mail, by fax or in writing to the following addresses:  Email: campbellma@npt.nuwc.navy.mil Fax: 	(401) 832-1134 Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport Mark Campbell Code 8191, Building 990/2 1176 Howell Street Newport, RI 02841-1708 Information regarding security clearance/visit request and hotel information can be found at: http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil under Visitor Information. Attendance is limited to persons who have registered and have approved security clearances in place. Registration requests and security clearance/visitor requests should be received not later than 16 July 2004.  Registration requests will be confirmed by 20 July 2004. The scope of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and the proposals solicited are limited and will be used for identifying innovative algorithm processing  techniques for future detailed development.  The Navy intends to award up to three (3) preliminary Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) studies, not-to-exceed (NTE) $100K each, from a total BAA budget of $300K.  However, the Navy reserves the right to award more, less or no studies as a result of this BAA.  Awards will be based on the merits of the proposals as evaluated by the Torpedo APB evaluation team.  Depending upon the success of the studies the potential exists for follow-on development contract awards.

NAVSEA is located at the Washington Navy Yard (WNY) where access is strictly limited in accordance wit h Naval District Washington (NDW) security regulations.  It is recommended that proposals be mailed in accordance with the BAA instructions.  In the event you prefer to hand carry your proposal, ensure adequate time has been allowed by your representative to accommodate the additional security procedures.  Detention at a NDW gate or failure to adhere to the procedures provided herein will not be considered an exception to timely proposal delivery.  Offerors hand carrying proposals shall call the contracting officer or contract specialist at least 48 hours prior to arriving at the WNY to make arrangements.  Offerors can enter the WNY via the First Street Gate off M Street SE.  Vehicles entering NDW are subject to random searches.  Visitors shall turn left onto Tingey Avenue at the end of the Southeast Federal Center at the second guard shack, show picture ID and follow Tingey Av enue until you have reached the last building on the right, Bldg 197.  Just before reaching another guard shack and before the end of  Bldg 197, you will see a loading dock directly across from the NDW Police Station.  Please pull into this loading dock area and notify your point of contact.  Packages should not be sealed as they are subject to inspection.  Classified material shall be prepared in accordance with current security requirements.  The contracting officer or contract specialist may receive the proposal and provide the Offeror a receipt with the time and date of delivery.  All offerors shall mark each package with the name of the contracting officer and the contract specialist, their codes and phone numbers.   Any proposal, modification, or revision, that is received at the designated Government office after the exact time specified for receipt of proposals is “l ate” and will not be considered unless:  (a)	If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized  by the announcement, it was received at the initial point of entry to the  Government infrastructure not later than 3:00 p.m. one working day prior  	      to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (b)	There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the       Government installation designated for receipt of proposals and        was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of        proposals; or (c)	It was the only proposal received. However, a late modification of an otherwise timely and successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Gove rnment installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the announcement, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the announcement closing date, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the announcement on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. The contracting officer must promptly notify any offeror if its proposal, modifications, or revision was received late and must inform the offeror whether  its proposal will be considered. NOTE: FULL PROPOSALS SENT BY FAX OR E MAIL WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. The Government’s rights in Proposals shall be in accordance with DFARS 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information (Jun 1995), available at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dp/dars/dfars/html/r20040101/252.227-7016.

The technical and cost proposals must be provided as separate volumes;  no cost information shall appear in the technical proposal and no technical information shall appear in the cost proposal. Offerors may submit proposals on any or all areas of interest.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the propos als received in response to this announcement.  Offerors must be able to certify that they have an appropriate facility clearance to meet the security requirements of work proposed, and key personnel must be certified as holding an appropriate clearance. 	Proposals shall address technical and cost/price.  Although length is not specified, succinct proposals are desired. 	Proposals shall include the following sections, each starting on a new page: A. A cover page, including proposal title, technical, cost and administrative points-of-contact along with the telephone and facsimile numbers and email addresses, followed by a letter signed by the authorized officer specifying the proposal validity period (at least 365 days). B. A one-page overview of the proposed processing improvement and/or concepts as well as any innovative claims for the proposed research, and how they wil l contribute to Torpedo APB and support the objectives of improving signal processing control. C. A one-page summary of the deliverables and schedule including data associated with the proposed research. D. A succinct Statement of Work clearly detailing the scope and objectives of the work and, if any, specific Contractor requirements.  If any portion of the research is predicated upon the use of Government-owned resources of any type, the Contractor shall clearly identify: the resources required, the date the resource is required, the duration of the requirement, the source from which the resource may be acquired, if known, and the impact on the research if the resource is not provided. 	E. Technical arguments that substantiate claims made in the overview (proposal section B) and a technical approach description consistent with the deliverables and schedule (proposal sectio n C). Technical arguments should also address any major risk areas. 	F. A description of the results, products, and transferable technology expected from the contract.

A detailed breakdown and summary of cost and price for the effort.  The  Offeror shall provide the number of proposed hours by labor category, all direct labor and indirect rates, a breakdown of any material costs proposed, and the proposed fee.  The Offeror shall also pro vide a point of contact, to include name, title, phone number and email address, at their cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). The evaluation of proposals will be performed by the cognizant Program Officer and other naval and defense activities/agencies personnel, including the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Newport division, as needed.  All evaluation team members will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information. Due to NUWC Newport’s participation in the evaluation of proposals, and in order to avoid any potential conflicts of interest, proposals from the Naval Undersea Warfare Center will not be accepted or considered for award. Evaluation of proposals will be based on the following criteria: ·	To what degree does the proposal demonstrate p otential for improving signal and weapon processing control beyond the current torpedo processing baseline (Block IV)? ·	Can the proposed study/development be completed in time to support the Torpedo APB schedule? ·	What is the probability that the proposed study effort will meet the objectives stated in the Offeror’s proposal? ·	Does the proposed study effort appear to be realistically achievable with the funds requested? ·	To what degree will the benefits of the proposed study effort be limited by restrictive data rights provisions or limited distribution of data? ·	What has been the Offeror’s past performance in signal processing algorithm enhancements and weapon control improvements? These criteria are in descending order of importance for evaluation purposes with the first three being significantly more important than the other evaluation criteria. At the conclu sion of the evaluation, Offeror(s) will be notified, as applicable, that: 1) its proposal has been accepted for negotiation, 2) its proposal has been accepted pending the availability of funds, or 3) its proposal has not been accepted.  NAVSEA will retain and file one copy of non-accepted proposals; all other copies of non-accepted proposals will be destroyed.  Those proposals accepted pending the availability of funds may be considered for funding for up to twelve months after the closing date of this BAA.  Not all proposals evaluated as acceptable will be funded.  Decisions to fund acceptable proposals will be based on funds available and the evaluation criteria set forth in this document.

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking industrial partners willing to license the technology to design and produce thin disk lasers.

LLNL has a history of working on thin disk laser technology.  Thin disk lasers promise to provide a laser with high power, high beam quality, high efficiency, and low weight.  The technology also has the promise of scaling to extremely high power.  These favorable attributes result directly from the geometry of the thin disk laser itself.  The thin disk is inherently lightweight.   The dominant heat flow direction is aligned with the laser beam propagation, which reduces phase distortion from the laser beam aperture.  Finally, because the facture-limited thermal power varies inversely with its thickness, the thin-disk laser can scale to high average power.

The LLNL technology uses a different approach from the most popular form of the laser as developed by the University of Stuttgart, which involves the use of multi-pass pump geometries.   The LLNL technology uses a thin-disk gain-loaded layer bonded to an index matched undoped disk (cap).   The undoped disk (cap) serves several purposes:
·	enables side pumping of the thin disk by guiding the pump light,
·	suppresses Amplified Spontaneous Emissions (ASE) and parasitics by more than a factor of ten,
·	adds mechanical strength to the fragile thin disk, and 
·	helps with the cooling of the thin disk.

LLNL currently has government funding to work on this technology, and actively working on improving the performance of the prototype laser.  LLNL believes the technology is sufficiently mature at this point (refer to U.S. Patents 6,347,109 and 6,763,050) to engage a commercial partner to commercialize the laser.  LLNL is also willing to engage in further collaborative research with a commercial partner, if desired by the commercial partner.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Thin Disk Laser technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 77-04
Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Thin Disk Laser technology.

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (ii) past performance (see FAR 15.304) and (iii) price.  The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

MANUFACTURERS QUALIFICATIONS.  The design, manufacture, testing, system qualification, & integration of Class III BSCÃ¢Â€Â™s are highly complex.  USAMRIID requires a working relationship with a manufacturer who has demonstrated successful, long term Class III & Class II design and manufacture capabilities of at least fifteen years. Factory must have demonstrated product support for these fifteen years in term of in house manufactured parts & outside vendor supplied items.  As there are interrelationships be tween Class III and Class II BSCÃ¢Â€Â™s, it is mandatory that the manufacturer be listed with the National Sanitation Foundation International Standard #49. 13. SCOPE OF WORK: The Aerobiology Center of Excellence will be housing, transferring, performing aerosol exposures, and analyzing results thereof, concerning non-human primates and rodents in a BL3 laboratory environment. To this extent, space has been allocated for three ( 3) independent Class III Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) lines for support of this research. Each Class III BSC will be nominally eight foot long & double sided, enabling work access from both long sides. An easily removeable transport/decontamination DC powered cart (nominal four foot length) will be provided at one end, and be secured with locki ng clamps designed to ensure repeated sealablility to Class III leak rate standards. Design of the system will permit transport cart portability from the animal holding room doors, to each Class III BSC docking adapter. Animals & work material will enter/ exit through the transport cart access door, and the entire system, (transport cart, docking adapter, Class III BSC) will be designed for decontamination via VHP & paraformaldehyde generator apparatus. (Note: VHP & Paraformaldehyde generators are USAMRIID provided, connection ports are only required). An additional dunk tank system will be  installed on the opposite end of the glove box.  Concept drawing with sufficient design details to permit a technical review will be required at time of proposal submission. Adherence to general layout, scope of operations, and specifications will be essential to proper evaluation. Ergonomic considerations are also essential. Location of glove ports, sloped viewscreens, access doors with method of closure, portability of transport carts, accessibility of internal/external  services, and human inter-relationships (i.e. Show drawing de tail of human accessibility) with these factors shall be considered.

5.  The following clause was referenced but inadvertently omitted from the RFQ - Offerors are cautioned to note the change in Required Delivery dates:   

52.211-9 Desired and Required Time of Delivery.  
DESIRED AND REQUIRED TIME OF DELIVERY (JUNE 1997)   

(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule.  DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No: All CLINs, Quantity:  Various; 45 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  

If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below.  However, the offeror’s proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government’s required delivery schedule as follows:  

REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.:  All CLINs; Quantity:  Various; 60 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.  

OFFEROR’S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.: All CLINs; Quantity: Various; WITHIN __________ DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract.  The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated.  Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails.  However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically.  (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)  If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  (End of clause)  

All other terms and conditions remains the same.  The Government intends to make one award for all items.  The closing date of the RFQ is hereby extended to 19 July 2004.
