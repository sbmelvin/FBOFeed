SOLICITATION # W91GY0-07-R-0038  Depot Integrator at Taji National Depot 
POC: Deirdre R. Bird, Contracting Specialist, 703-544-6152 

The following is a Request for Comment (RFC). This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. The intent is to contract for a Depot Integrator at Taji National Depot (TND) in accordance with the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW) and the drafts of Annex A/The Training Requirements Schedule by Facility, Annex B/The Trade Performance Standards, Annex C/The Indicative Equipment List for Procurement, Annex D/The TND Indicative Equipment List and Annex E/The Transition Requirements by Facility. The Scope of Work consists of the following requirements:

The Contractor shall train a workforce to operate and manage a Wheel Depot and a Track Depot and establish the initial operating capability for the wheeled, tracked and ancillary equipment maintenance facilities at Taji National Depot. The Contractor will develop bi-lingual (English/Arabic) training curriculum, deliver training to tradesmen and managers, procure industrial tools and equipment, commission maintenance and support facilities, establish a permanent Iraqi training institute, develop depot production processes and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and operate the maintenance facilities within the Depot for training purposes until the TND is completely transitioned to the Iraqi Joint Forces (IJF). During the course of the contract, the Contractor will develop and provide parts mortality data, recommended mandatory parts list and management reports as directed by the Project Management Officer (PMO).

The purpose of the RFC is to afford industry an opportunity to comment on any perceived issues with regard to the Depot Integrator Service and to allow the Government to receive the benefit of industry comments. The Governments purpose in providing an opportunity for industry comment is to identify potential problem areas, and provide alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of the service. The Government believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas. Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package. Comments are solicited regarding the following: 

1.	Joint Contracting Command Iraq (JCC-I)/Multi National Security and Training Command Iraq Support Division (MSD) is considering a negotiated firm-fixed unit-price indefinite-Quantity "Performance-Based" contract and an objective, measurable quality assurance surveillance plan. 

2.	Selection will be made on a best-value basis and significant emphasis will be afforded to technical and past performance in providing Depot Integrator services at TND as an evaluation criterion in determining award.

3.	JCCI/MSD will require the eventual awardee to provide Depot Integrator services including training of Iraqi depot personnel and the purchase, emplacement, acceptance testing, commissioning, training operation of equipment, and the development and execution of depot production processes, with clearly defined timelines for full transition of command, control and depot operations to the IJF. 

4.	JCCI/MSD will require the eventual awardee to provide training that will center on preparing Iraqi Army soldiers and civilian tradesmen, supervisors and leaders to perform industrial maintenance tasks in support of depot operations.
 
5.	JCCI/MSD will require the eventual awardee to provide procurement of industrial plant equipment and associated operating supplies and industrial consumables to be based on the attached Indicative Equipment Lists for each facility.

6.	JCCI/MSD will require the eventual awardee to provide operation for training purposes including the commissioning and operation of equipment, production process validation, production output and the implementation of suitable depot management and production processes including work flow, support operations, equipment safety, quality assurance and user/workstation/facility standard operating procedures (SOPs).

7.	JCCI/MSD will require the eventual awardee to provide the management and operation for training purposes of each facility to continue until transition to the IJF, at a time designated by the government.

8.	Comment regarding the appropriate length of training for each of the core competencies as required by Paragraph 4.7 of the attached Draft SOW and draft of Annex A/The Training Requirements Schedule by Facility. 

9.	Comment regarding processes to train all of the core competencies as required for an individual facility (i.e., the Small Arms Maintenance Facility, the Generator Maintenance Facility) simultaneously (see attached draft of Annex A/The Training Requirements Schedule by Facility) as it is the Governments intent to achieve initial operational capability upon the completion of training.  

10.	Comment regarding effective timelines for the procurement and delivery of the heavy and complex equipment within the attached draft of Annex C/The Indicative Equipment List for Procurement.

11.	Comments, whether supportive or critical, are earnestly solicited regarding every aspect of the Depot Integrator service at Taji National Depot. Replies are not mandatory. Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal Requests for Proposals. The use of comments received from industry to complete final statements of work and resulting solicitation documents will be at the discretion of JCCI/MSD. Any subsequent solicitations will be synopsized prior to its release. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. The Government will not critique a potential offerors comments and the RFC should not be used by offerors to market their products/services. The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of the RFC. Proprietary information is not being solicited. Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such. Responses to this synopsis must be submitted via email to the Contracting Specialist at Deirdre.bird@pco-iraq.net and at  MNSTC-I_SS@pco-iraq.net

<DESC>This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI).  This is not a request for proposal and no award will be made as a result of this announcement.  The information received as a result of this announcement will be used for market research purposes. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) VISN 23 is seeking preliminary marketing information from prospective contractors to provide, install, and implement an ICU clinical information system (CIS) and an anesthesia record keeping system (ARK).  This would include software application, relevant hardware, interfaces to medical devices, interfaces to VA's VistA CPRS, and interfaces to other systems.  The NAICS is 518210.   The scope of this initiative includes seven Medical Centers in VISN 23: Des Moines, IA; Fargo, ND; Forte Meade, SD; Iowa City, IA; Minneapolis, MN; Omaha, NE; and Sioux Falls; SD.  Each Medical Center has an ICU of between 4 and 16 beds.  Minneapolis has two ICUs.  All together, the VISN has eight ICUs totaling approximately 70 beds.  Minneapolis also has a 32-bed high acuity step down unit.  Each of these medical centers has a surgical program with 3-18 surgical suites, for a VISN total of about 50 operating rooms.   Additionally, the VISN has approximately 50 PACU beds.  We intend to implement CIS and ARK across all of these care areas.   The CIS and ARK will integrate information acquired at the point of care from a variety of medical devices.  These include, but are not limited to: physiologic monitors (GE, Philips), ventilators (Maquet, Respironics, Puritan Bennett), anesthesia machines (Drager, Datex Ohmeda), gas analyzers, infusion pumps (B.Braun, Alaris, Hospira), intra aortic balloon pumps, and SVO2/CCO monitors. The CIS and ARK will need to integrate with other information systems including, but not limited to: VA's VistA/CPRS hospital information system (Lab results, user passwords, ADT, VistA Imaging, etc.), data analytic system, and each other (CIS &amp; ARK).  Respondents are asked to respond to each of the following points:  We are seeking information on the capability to provide CIS and ARK as a single product or as separate products.  State whether you offer a CIS solution, ARK solution, or both.  If you offer both, please describe the degree of integration between the two applications and associated benefits with having a common provider.  If you do not offer both CIS and ARK, please describe how you integrate with systems in the other care environment. Describe system architecture, including: server(s), client workstations, LAN, operating system(s), database(s), software licensing.  Describe architecture of medical device integration. Describe your experience and capabilities to leverage application integration via CCOW.   If you have the capability to electronically capture and manage waveforms, please describe.   Describe any industry innovative practices concerning the overall CIS and ARK products. Describe extent of physical installation services you typically provide.  Describe site prep and physical infrastructure responsibilities of the VA.  Please provide information about turn-key and other installation procedures.       Describe your typical implementation process and services, including overall project management, flow sheet configuration design, education &amp; training, and go-live support.  What is typical implementation time duration from receipt-of-order to go-live?  Minneapolis has used ICU CIS for 15 years; describe how you would leverage existing flow sheet design and expertise to expedite implementation. Describe your service and support model: on-site &amp; remote maintenance, hardware &amp; software maintenance, application updates &amp; upgrades, design for failure resiliency, uptimes measures, strategies for partnering with VA in-house resources (Biomed, IT, Clinical Informatics), and any other innovative support elements. Provide examples of similarly scoped projects within the VA, Department of Defense, any in the Midwest, or elsewhere. Describe the extent and breadth of your experience interfacing with the VA's VistA hospital information system suite of applications. Provide a cost estimate major components of the CIS and ARK to fit this need. The requested information is for planning purposes, and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action may be issued.  However, the VA will utilize the information for technical and acquisition planning.  It is recognized that any cost information provided by the contractor is a preliminary estimate for planning purposes and may be marked as proprietary; the contractor will not be bound to these estimates. The VA invites comments related to possible purchase or acquisition strategies. If there is a FSS, GSA or other contract vehicle already available for the products being proposed, please include this information in the response. All data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as corporate or proprietary will be fully protected from release outside the government. It is not the intent of&#160;VA to reimburse contractors for the cost of submitting information in response to this RFI. The VA will not return pictures, documents, graphs or interrelated requested information.

<SUBJECT>R -- Space Commerce policy activities
<DESC>The NOAA, AGO, NESDIS Acquisition Division anticipates entering into a sole source under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures with the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs UN Office to provide secretariat services for NOAA as a participant in an international meetings and workshops. This is being done pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 and of 41 U.S. C. 253 (c)(1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

The Office of Space Commercialization (OSC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, is responsible for implementing space-related policies and promotion of capabilities of the U.S. commercial space industry.  The Office assists U.S. commercial providers in their efforts to expand their business with the U.S. Government and promotes commercial provider investment by performing economic analysis on space markets.  OSC acts as an industry advocate within the executive branch of the Federal Government to maximize the use of commercially available space goods and services, reduce legal and regulatory impediments, and ensure the government does not compete with the U.S. commercial space industry.

The December 8, 2004 U.S. Space-Based Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Policy authorized a new comprehensive national policy that established guidance and implementation actions for space-based positioning, navigation and timing programs, augmentations and activities for U.S. national and homeland security, civil, scientific and commercial purposes.  This policy established the National Spaced-Based PNT Executive Committee, co-chaired by the Deputy Secretaries of the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation, to manage the dual use (civil/military) GPS and established the National Space-Based PNT Coordination Office.  

OSC shall be the principal unit for space commerce policy activities within NOAA and the U.S. Department of Commerce.  The services required by OSC are available from only one responsible source, United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, with whom the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Space Commercialization is participant and include:

1.	Coordinate space commerce policy issues and actions within NOAA and the U.S. Department of Commerce.
2.	Represent the Department in the development of U.S. policies and in negotiations with foreign countries to promote U.S. space commerce.
3.	Assist commercial space companies in their efforts to do business with the U.S. Government, and act as industry’s advocate within the Executive Branch to ensure the Government meets its space-related requirements, to the maximum practical extent, with commercially available space goods and services, consistent with national security.
4.	Work to ensure the U.S. Government does not engage in space-related activities that preclude, deter, or compete with U.S. commercial space activities unless required by national security or public safety.
5.	Seek the removal of legal, policy, and institutional impediments to space commerce.

The United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, with whom the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Space Commercialization consults, contributes, and participates in programs of shared interest, shall provide secretariat services for the Director of the National Space-based PNT Coordination Office.  The Office of Outer Space Affairs will provide secretariat services for the International Committee on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (ICG) workshops, in which OSC will participate.  Accordingly, the services required by OSC are available from only one responsible source, the Office of Outer Space Affairs, which serves largely to provide those services.
