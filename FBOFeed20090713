<DESC><p>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS FOR A SOLE SOURCE ACQUISITION (AS REQUIRED BY FAR PART 5.2(b)(1). THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION/PROPOSAL. The Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of this contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. This requirement is considered noncommercial in nature and any resultant contract will be awarded in accordance with FAR Part 15. The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to award a sole source Fixed Price contract to Florida State University (FSU). The purpose of the requirement is to determine optimal parameter settings for the Weather Research and Forecast Model (WRF) and the optimal usage of its inline tracer capability for transport and dispersion modeling. The WRF model was developed by various agencies and universities (e.g., the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), the Penn State University and is considered the United States meteorological community mesoscale model. This research and development will consist of sensitivity studies of both WRF with its tracer capability, and WRF using other transport and dispersion models for comparison. The anticipated period of performance is 24 months from date of award. FSU is the only source known to be capable of fulfilling the government's requirement. FSU has unique experience in long range transport issues, having participated in seven NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) airborne field projects involving the global transport of air pollutants. Locations of those field projects include numerous regions within both hemispheres. This vast experience in performing and analyzing numerical model simulations over various regions of the world is critical to accomplishment of this requirement. This research will answer questions that are very similar to those encountered during the NASA research. FSU prepared various T&amp;D products for each project using a variety of meteorological model output ranging from global models down to the locally run Mesoscale Model 5 (MM5). By viewing the trajectories and comparing them with airborne in situ data, FSU has obtained vast experience in assessing the quality of trajectories and other T&amp;D parameters. Other research projects have given FSU extensive experience in sensitivity studies of additional mesoscale models (e.g., the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) and the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) and their applicability to transport and dispersion analyses. FSU has extensive experience with both mesoscale and transport and dispersion models. Finally, the FSU personnel can consult (at no cost) with other inhouse meteorological faculty who also are experts in running the WRF model. The solicitation for this requirement will be issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP). It is advertised with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541712, with a size standard of 500. Potential contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry to be eligible for award (See Internet site: http://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil). It is mandatory to obtain a DUNS number prior to registering in CCR by calling DUN &amp; Bradstreet (1-800-333-0505). This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations. Any firm that believes it can meet the specifications above may give written notification to the point of contact below. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

Oral presentations, as in a standard A/E evaluation, will be used for all members of the competitive range.At this time, an exact date of release is not known but release will not occur before May 1, 2009.

<DESC>RECOVERY - Install Silt Density Index Equipment - Replacement and Installation of 24 units, Yuma Desalting Plant, CRBSP, Title I,  PROJECT-  LC12926YDP002
THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED AS A NONCOMPETITIVE SOLE SOURCE SOLICITATION.   As provided under FAR 6.302-1, this Project will be solicited on a noncompetitive basis as "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  This project is being funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).  
The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for 24 continuous stream Silt Density Index (SDI) Analyzers (Federal Supply Class #52) and 24 SDI repair kits in support of advanced water treatment research and tests at the Yuma Desalting Plant (YDP) and Water Quality Improvement Center (WQIC).   SDI Analyzers are critical as they measure the likelihood of the clogging or plugging of the reverse osmosis membranes.   If the reverse osmosis membranes clog, it is extremely costly to repair or replace them so a reliable instrument is needed.  The SDI units currently in use were developed in the early 1980's.   They are suffering from severe operational and maintenance problems and need to be replaced as soon as possible.  The SDI Analyzers to be purchased by Reclamation are only manufactured by a small business called Chemetek, located in Portland, Oregon.  All manufacturing will be done at Chemetek's facility in Portland. The SDI Analyzers manufactured by Chemetek are highly specialized units that operate with unique and patented water borne particulate-measuring apparatus (U.S. Patent # 5253514).   Chemetek's SDI Analyzer has been tested by at the YDP and WQIC and performance-wise was found to be functionally superior to any other water borne particulate-measuring apparatus that have been tested on site by the YDP personnel or that are available on the commercial market.   As there are no known commercially available SDI's that meet the specific needs of the YDP, the Government intends to solicit this requirement on a noncompetitive basis.   
The NAICS Code identified for this action is 334513 - Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing forMeasuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.
Award is anticipated in mid November 2009.  The project period of performance is anticipated to begin November 15, 2009 with an anticipated completion date of September 15, 2010. The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price type.  
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
The contract award information will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website (FBO) at (www.fedbizopps.gov).  The Justification and Approval for using noncompetitive procedures will be posted after an award is made at the following address: http://www.usbr.gov/mso/aamd/doing-business-acquisitions-noncompetitive.html

The proposed contract action is for the purchase of a policy management solution to manage the full life-cycle for their policies.  We want all policies stored in a centralized location with easy key-word search access.  We also want to show evidence of compliance by linking our policies to the regulations and standards they support. During the term of the agreement, Compliance 360 agrees to provide Support Services for the hosted products purchased by the John D Dingell VA Medical Center as set forth in the contract.  As part of the support services, Compliance 360 will also provide Application Support, meaning assistance to the VA Medical Center in identifying and resolving questions or difficulties in using the software applications components of the products. The Policies Module will be used to create and organize our policies and procedures through the use of policy manuals, sections, and policy information pages.  Policy and procedure documents are handled electronically from start to finish; uploading, collaboration, approval, revisions, and version history.  Users may search through locked policies to read them buy security can be set to limit access if necessary.   Policies can be linked to standards, laws, and regulations in order to show evidence of compliance.  Reports can be configured to retrieve desired information.  Features & Benefits: central location for storing policies, link policies to regulations/standards as proof of compliance, automated workflow for more efficient management, automated reminders for key policy dates  Linked to Outlook, Rich searching capabilities, robust policy reporting system and web-based.  Physical Security:  All of the production systems are collocated at a Tier 1 facility.  As a result physical access to the systems is strictly monitored and enforced.   There are 4 employees of Compliance 360 that have access, and to enter they are required to provide identification.  Once inside, they are required to provide a series of security badges and keys to access our systems.  Network Security:  At the edge of our external network are routers and firewalls that only allow port 80 and 443 traffic through.  Once past those layers, there are a series of layer 3 switching, SSL accelerators, and load balancers that pass the request onto the web and application servers, which are on the non-routable side of the architecture.  Each transaction (web or API) that is serviced between Compliance 360 and the user is 128-bit SSL encrypted.  The session between Compliance 36 and the user is handled via an additionally encrypted session cookie that contains unique identifying characteristics.  From this session ID, we are able to determine who the user is and what organization the user belongs to.  This ensures that we only present records that are owned by the users organization.  Application Security:  The service has a full hierarchical sharing model that allows our customers to control visibility of information from the division level all the way down to the data object level.  This sharing model is setup and maintained by the customer to ensure the proper data sharing rules are put in place.  Also, each customer receives a unique file storage area, database and service account.  All files and databases are protected by access control lists linked to the service account.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii).  All FAR provisions and clauses may be reviewed and/or obtained from the General Service Internet address http://www.arnet.gov/far.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notice, is solely the discretion of the government.  Firms that believe they can meet the VAs requirements must submit proof to the Contracting Officer, Diane Foster, either by fax 313-576-1327 or e-mail: diane.foster@va.gov no later than July 24, 2009 at 9:00a.m. local time.

<DESC><p>The National Science Foundation proposes to enter into a purchase order with&nbsp;Lux Research, Inc to obtain access to their Lux Research Nanomaterials Intelligence (LRNI) service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO) provides technical and administrative support on behalf of the Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET) Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council. The NSET Subcommittee is the coordinating body for the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). NNCO was created in 2001 under a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and others. NNCO currently provides support to 17 additional agencies that have joined the NSET Subcommittee since 2001, for a total of 25 agencies participating in the NNI as of 2009.</p>
<p>The NSET Subcommittee has approved an FY 2009 NNCO budget that includes funds for NNCO to subscribe to the LRNI service. This service will provide access for all NSET Subcommittee members to the series of reports on nanotechnology that LUX Research has prepared over the past several years, and any new reports that they publish over the coming year. These reports are the most frequently cited source of information on nanotechnology investment trends and market opportunities, both within the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>The breadth of detailed information available through the LRNI service is not available from any other source. Also, the NSET Subcommittee requires access to the LUX Research information in order to be better able to compare other sources of information to the LUX Research information, and therefore to evaluate the validity of the highly cited LUX Research reports. Purchasing this subscription to the LRNI service will also provide NNCO staff members and NSET Subcommittee members with direct access to LUX Research analysts who prepared these reports, and will therefore enable direct communication concerning the methodologies that LUX has been using to develop its nanotechnology reports, thus allowing for better assessment of the validity of those reports.</p>
<p>See note 22 except that responses demonstrating their capability to provide a comparable service are due no later than 4:00pm, July 21, 2009.</p>

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), is conducting a Market Survey/Request for Information to improve the Government's understanding of the current marketplace and to identify qualified sources capable of Re-designing and manufacture of a Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) RF Filter Amplifier (RFFA) for the MMAC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Interested sources must respond with information to confirm evidence of qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish an acquisition strategy.  Responses to this market survey will be used in part to determine whether or not adequate competition exists to set the requirement aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) or Small Business, or open it up for full and open competition.  Any interested sources may respond to this market survey.  The information gleaned from this market survey may result in a restricted Screening Process when the RFP is issued.  All decisions will be made based on the information provided by vendors responding to this market survey.  This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.  This survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will be utilized for planning purposes only.
The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 334519, Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing, with a Small Business Size Standard of 500.
The FAA intends to award a stand-alone Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract by October 2009.

The MPS1000 is a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) piece of equipment in the ITWS rack that accepts input weather data from many weather sources, including the ASR9 radar, ASR11 radar, NEXRAD radar, TDWR radar, and the National Weather Service (NWS).   The ITWS was acquired by the FAA program office from Raytheon, beginning in 1998. The first twenty-two (22) ITWS racks (of the thirty-three total) were deployed by Raytheon with the Performance Technologies MPS800 Communications (Comms) Concentrator.  The ITWS software was developed to communicate with and control the Performance Technologies MPS800 device, to facilitate communications with various radars such as the ASR9, ASR11, and NEXRAD.  The MPS800 model became End of Life (EOL) in 2007, and it is no longer supported by the manufacturer. In addition, replacement units are no longer available when these units fail.  Therefore, the FAA directed the ITWS contractor (Raytheon) to deploy the last eleven (11) ITWS sites with the newer version of the comms concentrator, the MPS1000.   AJW-14A was funded by the ITWS Program Office to retro-fit the first twenty-two (22) ITWS sites with the new Performance Technologies MPS1000.   This retrofit is required to ensure that the fielded ITWS equipment is fully supportable and maintainable.

This extension willallow for a continuation of current service orders issued, for modifications to existingservice orders, and for new work until the BASE competitive follow-on contract is inplace. The contract extension and increase to the IDIQ maximum ordering value arenecessary in order to ensure program continuity and critical mission support and to avoidsignificant technical impacts to the BASE program.The current Contractor provides the following mission critical services to GSFCs ITCD:program management services; computer operations services; business infrastructuresupport services; application development, deployment, enhancement, and continuoussupport for business information systems; and sustaining engineering support.

<DESC>The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to solicit proposals for the Selectable Output Weapons (SOW) Future Naval Capability (FNC) program.  This is a continuation of the requirement posted under Special Notice N6893609R0015 Request for Information.  The SOW FNC is a 5 year program, the intent of which is to demonstrate to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of TRL6 a warhead whose explosive output or kill mechanism can be selected from the cockpit of the launch aircraft.  The technology must be suitable for a bomb having the same aerodynamic shape and mass properties of the existing BLU-111.  It is envisioned that this will be a three phase program.  Phase I will focus on analyses and testing to select or verify technologies and configurations that will meet a variety of potentially competing operational requirements.  Phase II will focus efforts on maturing technologies of the various subsystems required to achieve selectable output and mitigate risk associated with transitioning the technology into the design having the same aerodynamic shape, mass properti3es and interfaces as the existing BLU-111.  Phase III is to integrate sub-systems to demonstrate a selectable output 500 lb. class bomb with multiple outputs that can be selected by the pilot from the cockpit.  
This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  A formal Request for Proposal (RFP)/Solicitation will not be issued. 
The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (NAWCWD) will not issue paper copies of this BAA.  NAWCWD reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the Proposals in response to this BAA.  NAWCCWD reserves the right to fund all, some, or none of the Proposals received under this BAA.  NAWCWD provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and Cost Proposal (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  It is the policy of NAWCWD to treat all Proposals as competition sensitive Bid and Proposal Information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation. 
Awards will be to United States (U.S.) companies only and will be in the form of contracts.  Therefore, Proposals submitted as a result of this announcement will fall under the regulations of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).

The A-E must demonstrate their qualifications and the qualifications of each key consultant with respect to the published selection criteria for all services.  Selection criteria 1 through 9 are listed below in descending order of importance.  Specific selection criteria include:
1.  Specialized Experience:  Firm's demonstrated recent experience in design of medical and/or dental facilities of similar size, complexity and dollar value.  List a maximum of five (5) relevant projects completed in the past ten (10) years which best describe experience in design of medical and/or dental facilities discussed above. 2.  Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence of the Individual Design Team Members:  Limit submission to not more than ten (10) key personnel.  For each key personnel, explain the scope of their responsibilities in the proposed organization.  Explain how the firm's organizational construct is most appropriate considering effectiveness and cost factors.
a.  Active U.S. professional registration or equivalent qualifications.  Note:  During contract execution, U.S. registration will be required for all engineers who approve designs.
b.  Past experience in design of medical and/or dental facilities of similar size, complexity and dollar value.  Provide up to a maximum of five (5) relevant projects for each key person.  
3.  Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated on past performance with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and cooperation and responsiveness.  Firms should include any letters of commendation or awards.  Firms will also be evaluated on performance evaluations obtained from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS).  
4.  Available capacity and ability to perform the work in the required timeframe of approximately 9 months from date of award.
5.  Sustainable Design:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of their knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts through an integrated design approach and designing in accordance with the U.S. Green Building Council, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System or equivalent.  Identify examples indicating design team (including consultants) experience and concepts employed, LEED certification points anticipated and final LEED points awarded, and LEED certified professionals proposed for this contract.
6.  Quality Control Program:  Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure technical accuracy and discipline coordination of plans and specifications.  List responsible key personnel. 
7.  Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.  Identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.
NAVFAC's FY09 subcontracting targets in terms of percentages of total subcontract effort are:  SB  - 65%; SDB  - 16.18%; WOSB  - 14.53%; HUBZone SB - 1.42%; VOSB - 3%; and SDVOSB - 3%.  An Offeror's proposed goals will also be evaluated against the total value of its proposal.  Firms not intending to subcontract and/or not meeting the respective SB goals should provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  In order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  
8.  Firm's location in the general geographical area of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract. 
9.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (DOD) within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.
For selection criteria (1) and (2), firms and staff with only medical or only dental facility design professional qualifications or specialized recent experience/technical competence will be considered less favorably than firms and staff with both medical and dental facility design qualifications and experience/technical competence.  In addition, the following medical and dental facility projects will be considered more favorably:  DoD medical and dental facilities designed in accordance with Medical Military Facilities design criteria (UFC 4-510-01) or other military medical and dental facilities; and medical and dental facilities designed for tropical environments similar to Hawaii, Guam and the Pacific Ocean areas.  The intent is to ensure quality of design and construction and thereby extend the economic life of shore facilities in an environment considered aggressive because of constant sun, rain, salt, and humidity; frequent high winds, wind-blown sand and salt spray; tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, lightning storms, and other detrimental environmental aspects.  Tropical environments are considered to occur in the tropical region, which is considered to cover a broad band of the earth's surface bordering the equator from the Tropic of Capricorn to the Tropic of Cancer.
Include the following items in Section H, Block 30 of the SF 330:  (1) a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria, (2) an organization chart  of the proposed team showing the names and roles of all key personnel listed in Section E with the associated firm as listed in Section C, (3) your DUNS, CAGE, and TIN numbers, and (4) evidence that your firm is permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering, i.e., State registration number.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate a contract on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source. NRL will negotiate with IR Cameras, Incorporated, 1600 Providence Highway, Walpole, MA 02081-2553, for a Luna DR Camera System-Santa Barbara Focal Plane.   The NRL has been tasked with the support of a wide variety of airborne and laboratory data collections for internally and externally funded programs.  The NRL uses mid-wave infrared (MWIR) imaging systems to take high spatial and thermal resolution images of land and in-water targets.  These systems are specified by the sensitivity and size of the detector at the core of the imager.  The output imagery must be acquired with GPS/INS information provided by ancillary instruments in order to geolocate the data with sufficient accuracy.  The NRL requires a MWIR imaging systems which can be integrated with existing and expected NRL imaging and GPS/INS hardware, and with all the specifications attached to this document.  One of the principle requirements is the ability to record high spatial and thermal resolution infrared imagery synchronized with other imaging and data collection systems.  To meet this requirement a system consisting primarily of a MWIR imager, data collection system, and associated interconnects is necessary.  NRL scientists have been working in this area for many years, and have utilized a variety of these types of systems.  There are already data collection systems and associated interconnects in place, which would require expending manpower and monetary resources to modify these parts of the system.  This requirement is for the purchase of a new imaging system to integrate with existing NRL systems and for high spatial and thermal resolution MWIR imagery capability to support several NRL missions. The MWIR system identified was the only one available that met the stringent spatial and thermal requirements, and would also interface with existing NRL assets.  Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The project consists of a major modernization upgrade project for the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building (FB) and a window replacement project for the adjacent Byron G. Rogers U.S. Courthouse. This work is performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The FB occupies a prominent position in the Federal District of downtown Denver. It is an existing multi-tenant professional office building with 18 stories and a basement. The FB contains 494,156 gross square feet (GSF), 437,551 rentable square feet (RSF), and 329,433 usable square feet (USF). The current FB tenants will be relocated prior to the start of the modernization project. Agencies to be located in the federal building will be the Commission on Civil Rights, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Social Security Administration, and the General Services Administration.<br />The courthouse is a multi-tenant office and court building. It is five stories high with a basement and subbasement connected to the FB by a two story section. This section contains building services, a loading dock, and a two lane ramp to the parking garage. The courthouse houses six major tenants including United States District Court, Court Administrative Support Center, Probation and Pre-Trial Services, U.S. 10th Circuit Library, 10th Circuit Mediation and the United States Marshals Service. The building is approximately 248,000 GSF including two levels of underground parking spaces within the basement and sub-basement. A comprehensive modernization project for the courthouse was completed in 2005. The courthouse will remain occupied while the windows are replaced. The federal building and courthouse are located at 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado, 80294. Both buildings are long-term GSA-held assets situated in a prime location near downtown with public transportation within the central business district, in the Federal District of downtown Denver, with a stable tenant base and a high reinvestment need.</p>
<p>Project goals and objectives for the federal building are to provide a pleasant, secure, and safe environment for the staff and visitors consistent with guidelines for Federal facilities and specifically the GSA PBS P-100; satisfy current and projected special-use needs, and allow for future expansion of these requirements; design facilities compatible with the tenants' existing character and local context, and present a positive image of U.S. Government facilities; use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. GSA requires all new construction, renovation, and modernization projects to be certified through the LEED program; owing to the historic significance of the building, all work will follow the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, Revised 1992 (36 CFR 67); upgrade the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; upgrade the mechanical piping, heating, and hot water systems; upgrade the electrical system and install new telecommunications infrastructure; modernize all elevators; remove all asbestos containing materials (ACMs); implement GSA's workplace procedures and achieve measurable effectiveness results; identify design strategies that work to optimize the project's access to energy from seasonal solar, natural lighting, and wind to reduce undesirable loads and maximize desirable loads to meet desired energy targets for the facility; upgrade by replacing all public and private restrooms, plumbing systems, and fixtures; upgrade building security; replace underground water and waste water service lines.</p>

<DESC>SPAWAR Systems Center Charleston intends to award a sole-source contract toEnterprise Electronics Corporation (EEC), 128 S Industrial Blvd, Enterprise, AL36330. This procurement covers the systems, components, ancillary parts,software packages, technical manuals, and training courses for the currentSupplemental Weather Radar (SWR)-250. The SWR-250 is Doppler weatherradar with an operational mission to detect, process, and display weather. SWR-250 was first developed on a previous contract N65236-97-D-3018 and wasfollowed by N65236-04-D-6711 for continued support.EEC is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) that holds the proprietaryrights to the design and manufacture of the SWR-250 system, components andsoftware. Procurement of another manufacturer's radar system would result inunacceptable delays in the fulfillment of agency requirements, substantialduplication of cost to the Government, and duplication of efforts in Life CycleManagement. A Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity typecontract is anticipated. The NAICS Code is 334511 and the size standard is 750.This is a notice of intent and is NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.Any responses to this announcement should be submitted to ContractSpecialist Matt Dellinger, Code 223MD at vincent.dellinger@navy.mil no laterthan 1400 Eastern on 22 July 2009.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;proposal is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.Solicitation number N65236-09-R-0096 is issued as a RFP.  The items requiredunder this procurement are for the purchasing of approximately seventy-five(75)  new spectrum analyzers and turning in the existing spectrum analyzers,Agilent Model E4407S-E57, currently used for support of Tri-band DMCS Satcomterminals to Model 8564 EC Spectrum Analyzers needed to support the newquad-band DMCS Satcom terminals.  The Agilent spectrum analyzers currentlyin inventory covered the frequency range up to 26.5 GHZ which was sufficientfor the original tri-band (C0, X- and Ku-) DMCS terminals.  However, theseunits are currently being upgraded to add a Ka-Band capability which requires aspectrum analyzer that can cover the frequency at least up to 31.0 HHz.  TheAgilent 8564 EC (OR EQUAL) has a frequency range that covers up to 40 GHzwhich meets the new requirements.FACTOR A:1.

<DESC>RECOVERY - DEMOLITION OF DISCONTINUED STREAMGAGES AND CABLEWAYS
The Department of Interior, United Stated Geological Survey (USGS), installs and maintains streamgages and cableways throughout the nation to measure the water quality and quantity of our rivers.  When cooperator funding is no longer available, or when a monitoring requirement no longer exists, the USGS discontinues the use of a streamgage or cableway.  Such a station is referred to as "discontinued."  Discontinued streamgages often have stilling wells (shafts) associated with them, and discontinued cableways are large structures that seem to draw people to climb on them; both present a fall hazard.  
This requirement is to demolish/remove ("demo") approximately 1,250 discontinued stations located in virtually every state/territory, including AK, HI, and PR.
One (1) solicitation will be issued following this announcement.  One (1) contract will be awarded for each of the following states, for a total of three (3) contracts: AK, HI, and PR.  These opportunities will be set-aside for participation by small business concerns.  Offerors may propose on any other combination of states to form a contract, with a minimum contract covering one (1) state, except that neither CT nor RI may stand-alone; each must be combined with at least one other state, and those two states may not be combined together unless also combined with at least one other state.  These opportunities are unrestricted.  
All contracts will be commercial, firm-fixed price, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts, with ordering periods from the contract(s) effective date through 30 September 2010. All work must be completed by 30 September 2011.  The solicitation and any documents related to this acquisition will be available on the internet on or about 03 August 2009.  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  A formal solicitation, performance-based work statement, and/or technical exhibits are not available for release at this time.
As stated above, this opportunity is partially set-aside for participation by small business concerns and partially unrestricted.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238910 (Site Preparation Contractors, with corresponding index entry of "demolition contractor,") for which the corresponding size standard is $14.0M.  There is not an incumbent contractor.
Full or partial funding for requirements to be completed by resultant contract award(s) will utilize funds provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the Act).  Inclusion of unique provisions required to implement the Act, including those for significant reporting and transparency requirement by the successful offeror(s), will be required in resultant contract(s).
Questions and comments should be submitted via email to streams_cables@usgs.gov.

<DESC>RECOVERY - ABANDONMENT OF DISCONTINUED GROUNDWATER MONITORING WELLS
The Department of Interior, United Stated Geological Survey (USGS), installs and maintains groundwater monitoring wells throughout the nation to measure the water quality and quantity of our aquifers.  When cooperator funding is no longer available, or when a monitoring requirement no longer exists, the USGS discontinues the use of a monitoring well.  Such a well is referred to as "discontinued."  Until the discontinued well is properly "abandoned," however, it can potentially serve as a conduit for contamination of the aquifer.  
This requirement is to abandon more than two hundred "projects," each of which consists of at least one (1), and often many more, individual wells/boreholes.  There are many  inactive boreholes throughout the nation ready for abandonment, located in the following states/territories: AK, AZ, CA, DE, FL, GA, IN, KS, LA, MD, MI, MT, ND, NH, NJ, NY, PA, PR, UT, WA, WY.
One (1) solicitation will be issued following this announcement.  One (1) contract will be awarded for each of the following states, for a total of five (5) contracts: AK, IN, LA, MI, PR.  These opportunities will be set-aside for participation by small business concerns.  Offerors may propose on one or more of these states.  The USGS has grouped remaining states into four (4) "regions," as follows: "Northeast," consisting of NY, MD, NJ, NH, DE, and PA; "Southwest," consisting of CA, AZ, and UT; "Southeast," consisting of GA and FL; and "Northwest," consisting of WA, MT, ND, and WY.  These opportunities will be unrestricted.  Offerors may propose on one or more of these regions, but, within a region, must propose on all states contained therein.  At minimum, one (1) contract will be awarded for all four (4) regions; at maximum, four (4) contracts will be awarded, one for each region.  Finally, the state of KS will be included as an optional line item.  Offerors may propose to work in Kansas, but only in conjunction with an otherwise acceptable proposal - there will not be a separate contract award for Kansas.  
All contracts will be commercial, firm-fixed price, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts, with ordering periods from the contract(s) effective date through 30 September 2010. All work must be completed by 30 September 2011.  The solicitation and any documents related to this acquisition will be available on the internet on or about 03 August 2009.  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  A formal solicitation, performance-based work statement, and/or technical exhibits are not available for release at this time.
As stated above, this opportunity is partially set-aside for participation by small business concerns and partially unrestricted.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237110 (Water and Sewer Line and Related Structures Construction, with corresponding index entry of "capping of water wells,") for which the corresponding size standard is $33.5M.  There is not an incumbent contractor.
Full or partial funding for requirements to be completed by resultant contract award(s) will utilize funds provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the Act).  Inclusion of unique provisions required to implement the Act, including those for significant reporting and transparency requirement by the successful offeror(s), will be required in resultant contract(s).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS), Division of Acquisition Operations (DAO) is seeking to obtain a Water System.  

The Office of Research will purchase a new laboratory water delivery system to replace a 14 year old system.  

Required specifications: The system must include the following components and meet these exact specifications:

1.	The units must be able to be mounted on a wall, or to stand on a bench-top for ease of use for shorter scientists.
2.	The units must have point-of-use filter delivery devices that allow for the further purification of the dispensed water.
3.	The units must have a bench-integrated system for delivery of the water at remote locations, through a point-of-use filter.
4.	The dispensing arm must be able to be removed from the arm, and the water flow must be activated through the point-of-use arm without returning to the filter housing unit.
5.	The units must be able to be up-graded with different filters that will improve the water quality produced without the purchase of a whole new unit and system. That improvement through filter change can occur with the change of the point-of-use filter, (i.e. to a BioPak filter), or through the change of the large filter in the unit housing. The change of filter would then eliminate contaminants that are now compromising the results of testing that is being performed in the laboratory.
6.	The maintenance of the units, and the changing of filters.
7.	Minimum routine maintenance of the units is preferred as the long range cost of consumables can be excessively expensive. 
8.	The units must be nearly silent during their periodic re-cycling of water through the filter throughout the day, as these units are located in the laboratory where employees are working. Loud squealing of the mechanism can be distracting and annoying to lab personnel.


The FDA anticipates using a firm fixed price type contract with a base and four (4) option years for these services.  The NAICS code is 333298.

Part A. Capability and Technical Experience  Interested parties should submit capability statement describing adequate training and experience in scientific and technical appropriateness in reference to providing a Water System.

Part B. Size of Business  Please provide your business size (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantage businesses, HUB Zone businesses; veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) and submit copies of any documentation such as letters of certifications to indicate the firm status. 

Part C. Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)  If any; provide disclosure of business activities of your company, your affiliates, and your team members and affiliates of your team members which create either a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest in the performance of the possible work on evaluation listed above.  

Part D. Cost Estimate  Please provide a cost estimate for the prospective services to be conducted under the potential to provide maintenance services.  Cost should consist of the type of personnel need, hourly rate/days, material and travel expense if applicable or related to the proposed project.   

Part E. Small Business  Describe your ability to meet the requirements in accordance with 52.219.14  Limitation of Subcontracting. 

Responses shall adhere to the following:  

1.  Reference the Sources Sought number when submitting Capability                          Statement. 
2.  The capability statement shall be no more than five (5) pages in length.  
3.  The marketing materials shall not be included.
4.  The capability statement shall be e-mailed to the attention of the Contract Specialist listed above.

FDA makes no implied or in fact contract by issuing this Sources Sought. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the FDAs view of the information received.  Material that requires a non-disclosure agreement or that may be business sensitive will not be accepted. Please note that responses to this notice will not be returned.

<DESC><p>Request for Information. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center, MacDill AFB, FL (hereinafter referred to as Government) intends to purchase an aircraft Audio Communication System (ACS) for a refurbished P-3 aircraft. The purchase will include spares, maintenance and repair documentation for the ACS and the option to purchase additional systems within the next two years. The purpose of this request for information is to determine (1) if there are small business concerns capable of satisfying the Government's requirements; (2) availability of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems; and (3) the extent to which commercial items or non-development items could be modified by the manufacturer to meet Government needs
<p>OVERVIEW - NOAA AOC operates and maintains a fleet of three WP-3 Orion aircraft. Two of the AOC WP-3 aircraft have functional, but aging, AIC-22 analog ACSs, the third WP-3 is equipped with an AIC-22 system installed at the flight crew stations only. These aircraft are scientific research platforms with a flight crew of 4, and an additional crew of up to 17 scientists and mission equipment operators. All aboard require interface to the ACS. The special mission of the AOC requires a high degree of communications between the relatively large number of science crew members and the flight crew. The digital audio system for the AOC WP-3 aircraft must be not only functional and reliable, but also require minimal training for proper operation of the crew member interface boxes.</p>

<p>The Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of 1984 (Title III of Pub.L. 98-623, 16 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.) Provides the legislative authority necessary to implement, with respect to the United States, the Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) Program. The AMLR Program, which is managed by the Antarctic Ecosystem Research Division (AERD) at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC), provides information to the U.S. delegation to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), part of the Antarctic treaty system.</p>
<p>CCAMLR is an international treaty between 23 nations that seeks to manage Antarctic fisheries with the goal of preserving species diversity and stability of the entire Antarctic marine ecosystem. In keeping with this objective, CCAMLR has designated areas of research that member nations are obligated to pursue. The AMLR Program has identified specific data sets that must be collected to respond to CCAMLR's research directives. In doing so, the AMLR Program supports the U.S. Government's commitment to CCAMLR.</p>
<p>In 1996/97, the AMLR Program, in cooperation with the NSF, began providing logistical support for the NSF field camp at Admiralty Bay, King George Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Within the vicinity of this study area, the AMLR program has a large-area survey grid. The NSF field camp and study area are adjacent to an area where reproductive success and feeding ecology of breeding penguins have been monitored since 1976. Dr Wayne Trivelpiece has directed the predator studies at this NSF site since its inception in 1976, together with Susan G. Trivelpiece, Co-PI. In October 1997, Dr Trivelpiece accepted a full time position with the NMFS in La Jolla, CA and the NSF transferred funding for the continuation of this study to the SWFSC.<br /><br />II.

2. ISSUANCE DATE:  July 13, 2009
3. CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED  
   FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS:  August 10, 2009
4. POSITION TITLE: Project Development Officer  USAID/Kosovo
5. MARKET VALUE: $ 98,156.00 - $ 127, 604.00  per annum (GS 15  equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  September 2009 - September 2011 
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

A. Background

Kosovo's stability and integration into Europe are critical for lasting peace in southeastern Europe.  Following its declaration of independence in 2008, Kosovo is transitioning from eight years as a United Nations (UN) protectorate after NATO's successful intervention to stop ethnic cleansing.  Peace and stability in the Balkans and integrated, free markets are important European and U.S. foreign policy interests.  Kosovo established an International Civilian Office to ensure that Kosovo meets democracy and human rights standards, particularly related to minorities.  Among the many political and economic uncertainties of this process, the new Kosovo state has not been recognized by either Belgrade or many Kosovo Serbs.  This has left ambiguity regarding the departure of the UN Mission which had administered Kosovo, and the start up and role of the new European Union Rule of Law Mission, whose central aim is to assist and support the Kosovo authorities with police, judiciary and customs.  In this complex environment, USAID is helping a newly independent Kosovo build effective and transparent institutions capable of governing.  High unemployment, growing concerns about corruption, and the slow pace of inter-ethnic reconciliation threaten to impede Kosovo's development.  Accordingly, USAID aims to stimulate economic growth and job creation for a young population, foster good governance and democracy, lay the foundations for rule of law, and support the emergence of a viable private sector and civil society.  The program also includes confidence-building measures to address underlying causes of conflict and to improve inter-ethnic harmony.  

USAID/Kosovo is a medium-sized mission with 95 staff positions (9 USDHs, 5 PSCs, and 81 FSNs) working in six offices:  Program and Project Development; Economic Growth; Democracy and Governance; Controller; Executive; and Director's Office.  USAID/Kosovo has an active portfolio of approximately $150 million.  The FY 2008 program budget was $75.6 million, which supported assistance through 29 implementing partners and numerous sub-awards.  In addition, the Mission programmed another $28 million from a supplemental appropriation.  The FY 2009 budget is expected to total $60 million.  The Mission's FY 2009 operating expense budget is approximately $3.8 million.  The USAID Regional Services Center in Budapest provides procurement and legal services.

<p>The National Institutes of Health intends to award a sole source contract to Perkins + Will Architects (P+W) to provide A/E services for Design, Post Design, Bidding, Construction Administration Services and Optional A/E Services for the West Satellite Switching Station. This project will provide power for the forthcoming John Edward Porter Neuroscience Research Center Phase 2 facility and other existing facilities on the west side of the Bethesda campus. The contract vehicle for this A/E service is a Firm Fixed Price contract for an eighteen month period, with a one -year option. The total contract award value including the option year will not exceed $5M. NIH anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(d)(1)(B) to provide this service to meet mission critical requirements for the following reasons:</p>
<p>&bull; Perkins + Will created the 35% drawings and they are familiar with NIH issues pertaining to it.</p>
<p>&bull; Perkins + Will has the professional liability of existing construction documents since they authored them. No other architect or engineer could work to administer the construction of these documents without specific authority granted by Perkins + Will and no other architect would be able to totally accept the liability of these Perkins + Will documents.</p>
<p>&bull; No other group has the design intent knowledge that Perkins + Will developed during the preparation of the construction documents. Perkins + Will by virtue of being the author of these contract documents has spent thousands of man hours in their preparation and is the group most familiar with them.</p>
<p>&bull; Perkins + Will was initially scheduled to perform these services, but the contract vehicle expired before funds became available. The West Satellite Switching Station was originally a change order to the Porter Neuroscience Research Center (PNRC) 1 construction contract. However, after the PNRC1 was constructed, the contract ended and the West Satellite Switching Station design was put on hold.</p>
<p>&bull; It would be extremely inefficient and not cost effective and probably would raise legal considerations if the owner of the documents engaged the services of any party other than Perkins + Will to provide A/E construction administration services for this project.</p>
<p>&bull; To compete for these A/E services would require a significant amount of time that would delay the start of construction and adversely impact its support for the critical ARRA mission project: Porter Neuroscience Research Center (PNRC) 2.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></p>
<p>The building project is West Satellite Switching Station on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland.

FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.

Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to add two line items to the existing Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract N00164-08-D-WQ02, with Antenna Research Associates Inc., 12201 Indian Creek Court,  Beltsville, MD 20705-4224.  The additional CLINs will add a minimum 1 and maximum 6 of P/N DRG-118; and a minimum of 1 and maximum 8 of P/N SAS-260HV-10.  Delivery Orders will continue to be issued on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary information of Antenna Research, form, fit, and function compatibility and the duplicative cost to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Government's requirement.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  The point of contact is to Ms. Karen Smith, Code 0563WK, telephone (812)854-5669 or email:  karen.a.smith1@navy.mil.  Please reference the contract number if responding to this notice.

<CONTACT>Gladys M Wilks, Contract Specialist, Phone 571-227-4637, Email gladys.wilks@dhs.gov
<DESC>This procurement action is being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement; therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to award a sole-source contract for Rapid General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) tracker, tracking services, and AT&T Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication services to Datong Electronics, 4451 Brookfield Corporate Drive, #111, Chantilly, VA  20151.  

This specific device and services are needed because of the varying degrees of cellular coverage throughout the country.  A particular service provider may be dominant in one area and not in another.  Currently, the Office of Inspection has no equipment to satisfy the need for TSA inspection missions located in particular areas of the country where AT&T is the only service provider.  

TSA intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This sole source procurement is based on 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) which states that supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source.

This is a notice of intent to award a sole source procurement action and is not a request for competitive proposals.  All interested firms must respond July 20, 2009 at 12:00 p.m. local Washington D.C. time to Gladys Wilks, REF:  HSTS03-09-P-INS029, gladys.wilks@dhs.gov.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  TSA will not reimburse for any costs connected with providing the capability information.

<DESC>QUESTIONS & ANSWERS REGARDINGSOLICITATION VA-255-09-RP-0421 PROJECT 657-CSI-101, MRI ADDITION, BLDG 42 MARION, IL, VA MEDICAL CENTER NOTE: 	The following questions have been submitted by interested parties, and the answers are being publically posted in order to make the information available to all potential offerors. This is being provided for informational purposes only, as it does not change the terms & conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract. Q1. 	Will alternate methods of construction be considered, provided they meet the design intent as outlined in the solicitation? A1. 	The contractors should build to the documented set of drawings and specs prepared by the professional engineers and architects. Q2. 	Please provide the make and model of the MR and CT? A2.	The CT scanner is still in the process of being approved. The MRI is GE Discovery 450.Q3.	Will there be any additional scheduled site visits?A3.	Additional site visits can be arranged on a case-by-case basis through coordination with the designated Technical Representative (Jeremiah Benoit). Once again, the answers to any and all submitted questions will be made available to all potential offerors. Q4.	Is vermiculite to be an alternate addition to the base proposal? A4.	Vermiculite insulation is an add alternate in all instances. Q5.	Section 010000  General Requirements - Per the project documents provided (para. 1.22), contractor is to provide professional construction digital imaging of proposed contracted items of construction. - Please verify this requirement. A5.	For clarification purposes, please understand that photographic documentation of pre-existing conditions, conditions during construction, and the final completed project are a standard that benefits the construction contractor every bit as much as the government. For example, if there was undocumented pre-existing damage somewhere in the construction site, such photographic documentation would effectively relieve the contractor of liability for damage done before they got there. This process also helps the contractor document justifications for change orders due to differing site conditions. The correct interpretation of "professional grade" is not meant to be the most expensive high-end digital cameras available; it simply means providing adequate quality images. Given the current standard quality levels, and affordability, of typical commercial digital cameras, meeting such a requirement should not require a major equipment investment, at all. The exact details of how many images and/or prints are needed can always be worked out with the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. The photos do not need to be taken by a "professional" photographer; they just need to be taken by a skilled and knowledgeable employee of the contractor. Q6.	Section 013323  Shop Drawings, Product Data, and Samples - Per the project documents provided (para. 1-4), contractor is to forward submittals in sufficient time to permit proper consideration and approval action. - Advise as to the period of review (calendar day) for shop drawings, product data, and/or samples. A6.	The VA will have 15 working days to review and approve of all submittals. Q7.	Schedule for Finishes? A7.	The Finish Schedule is at Section 09 06 00 in the project specifications. Q8.	What are the specific requirements for the sitting bench? A8.	Use LYON PP5794 as a basis of design for the bench. Q9.	Advise as the necessity/requirement of a double detector check valve assembly as part of the proposed system and the acceptability of non-metallic piping materials (C.P.V.C.) in lieu of the specified metallic piping materials. A9.	It will be acceptable to use the existing double check with flow switch.CPVC can be used in the MRI suite only.Q10.	What is the CFM, EAT conditions, max LAT in the winter for AHU-1?A10.	6,000 cfm, 80/67. Max LAT in the winter would be ~ 90 degrees,(  0 degrees OA, MAT would be ~ 55, plus the 33 degree delta t of heat).Q11.	What is the steam pressure for the humidifier after the heating coil and before the chilled water coil? (The supply air is 6,000 cfm with 800 cfm of zero degree OA) Is the EAT to the humidifier 33 degrees?A11.	10 psi. 55 degrees, 40% RHQ12.	For the AHU-1 do you want the preheat coil to heat to 55 degrees before the humidity is injected?A12.	EA conditions to the humidifier will be 55 at 40% RH, with leaving RH of 80%.Q13.	What DDC interface use for the Hospital?A13.	Johnson Controls. Controls shall be all electric. Q14.	What are the Chilled water temps? The AHU cooling coil and chiller are not the same.A14.	Chiller is for the MRI heat exchanger not the AHU. Q15.	Is 40% PG is required?A15.	Yes. 	Q16.	Is free cooling used for the multistack specification?A16.	Yes. 	Q17.	The roof mounted AHU has an outside air damper for economizing, I'm assuming you would use air side economizer in lieu of a chiller "free cooling" option?   A17.	Yes, air side. See item e. 	Q18.	Could we possibly use (2) 20 ton standard Air-Cooled chillers in lieu of the Multistack option?A18.	The bid must contain the requirements established by the plans & specs. For option issues, provide the alternate number. A technical regarding this is how the unit will automatically change over (a functional requirement). Q19.	What pressure is the steam coming to the steam valve at? (PSI) A19.	10 psi to the humidifier control valve. Q20. 	Can you clarify keyed note #9 sheet 42-MH-3? A20.	The fan coil unit to be removed is to be relocated. There is not a new fan coil unit to be provided in the stair. 	Q21.	Does water need to be provide to the AC-1? A21.	Provide 1/4" water supply line to AC-1 for humidifier. 	Q22.	What is the size of the pipe for the water closer? A22.	Modify waste piping to show 4" for the water closet. (END OF Q&A DOCUMENT)

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the <br />Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any<br />other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201, including applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges added by a modification after contract award. The contractor may submit, on a yearly basis, a request for equitable adjustment for taxes, fees, and surcharges to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1, including applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges added by a modification after contract award. The contractor may submit, on a yearly basis, a request for equitable adjustment for taxes, fees, and surcharges to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<p>Wide Area Workflow is the Dept. of the Air Force's mandatory method of electronic invoicing. More information can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil.</p>
<p>Description of requirement:</p>
<p>0001 Airman &amp; Family Readiness Center (A&amp;FRC) Clerk/Discovery Resource Center (DRC) Monitor, providing employment assistance, counseling for available services, basic computer support and other services as defined in the Statement of Work (Attachment 1). Please submit price as follows:</p>
<p>0001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quantity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unit Price&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extended Price<br />Discovery Clerk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; months</p>
<p>NOTE: The period of performance (POP) for this requirement is from 1 October 2009 through 30 September 2010.</p>
<p>Basis for Award: This is a competitive selection in which competing offeror's past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis, when combined with the technical proposal, that will be significantly more important than cost or price considerations . By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in provision 52.212-1, Instructions To Offerors, and this associated Addendum, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices, performance records, and technical submissions. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. After determining that a complete and acceptable proposal has been received in accordance with the requirements documented in 52.212-1, offers shall initially be ranked according to price, as identified under the Description of requirement above. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified by the proposed unit price for each Item to confirm the extended amount. The price evaluation process will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>B. Next, the government technical team shall evaluate, on a pass/fail basis, the technical proposals submitted by the lowest priced offerors (usually the lowest 5-7 proposals) against the following evaluation factor:</p>
<p>(1) Resume: Resumes submitted will be evaluated to determine if the employee meets the requirements indicated in the SOW, paragraph 1. If the offeror is the sole employee, only the offeror's resume is required. If the offeror is a company proposing a staffing relationship, a resume for any/all employees intended to fill the position is required.</p>
<p><br />C. The government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation using a Past and Present Performance Questionnaire (Attachment 2). Offeror must send Past and Present Performance Survey to between two and four business references; references shall either email the completed survey to amy.burke@dover.af.mil, or fax to (302) 677-2309. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on each offeror based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances of efforts involving that are similar or greater in scope than the effort described in this solicitation. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "High Confidence/Exceptional" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past and present performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past and present performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of High Confidence/Exceptional, Significant Confidence/Very Good, Satisfactory Confidence/Satisfactory, Unknown Confidence/None, Little Confidence/Marginal, or No Confidence/Unsatisfactory, as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3. Past and present performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past and present performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence/None,"meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>D. In evaluating past and present performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>E. If the lowest priced evaluated offer passes the technical evaluation and is judged to have a "High Confidence/Exceptional" performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>F. In the event that the government does not make an award pursuant to paragraph E above, the government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance assessment rating of "Significant Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>By submission of an offer, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model. Award will be made without discussions - contractors are encouraged to offer their most advantageous pricing with their response. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from both a price and a technical standpoint. Failure of an Offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration.</p>

<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">e. Clearances <br />(a) Medical</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service. The Government will reimburse the cost of medevac insurance premiums. See C.3.i. Insurance (3) Medevac Insurance (b).<br />3) For all assignments outside of the United States, the contractor and any authorized dependents shall be required to be examined by one or more licensed doctors of medicine acceptable to CDC, and the contractor shall forward a summary of the results of the medical exams as well as copies of the original tests and laboratory reviews to the CDC's Office of Health and Safety (OHS) for adjudication as to whether the requirements of the position and assignment are met. For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">(c) Applies to only U.S. citizens: Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned annual leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC personal contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is earned at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that annual leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country and may be used only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the annual carryover limit, currently 360 hours, plus the number of hours earned and unused during the final pay year during performance under this contract.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be authorized advance annual leave in excess of leave earned, but in no case shall a contractor be authorized advance annual leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.<br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's original recruitment - to be determined by the Government at contract award. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of original recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:<br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 4 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel, or the cost of the Relief Travel will be deducted from the contractor's final payment, and any costs not recovered by deduction will be reimburseable to the Government.<br />v. The contractor must be approved in advance in writing for use of sufficient annual leave, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for Relief Travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred which is caused by the Government.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.<br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.<br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so, and based on medical opinion, contractor is fit to return to duty.<br />.<br />The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. Such authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not also a U.S. holiday.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer.<br />7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work. A PSC employee whose contract does not provide for overtime pay may be awarded Comp Time for overtime hours worked. One hour of Comp Time off is granted for each hour of overtime work. The accrual and use of Comp Time is subject to written supervisory approval, as with Annual Leave. All Comp Time hours must be recorded on the Time and Attendance Report as they are earned and used.<br />A PSC employee will lose entitlement to Comp Time earned if it is not used by the end of eight pay periods immediately after having been earned (16 weeks beginning the first pay period after the pay period in which the Comp Time was earned), unless the failure was due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control.<br />Overtime and Sunday Differential are not authorized under this contract. Should overtime be required during the performance of this contract, the Field Supervisor shall submit a request for contract modification.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">8) Passport<br />All passports must be valid for the entire period of performance of the contract. In the event that a passport expires during the period of performance of resulting contract, a copy of the renewed passport shall be submitted to the PCO.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">c) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide coverage or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such cases, the contractor could be eligible for contributions under paragraphs i.2(a) and/or (b) of this provision.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">d) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid.

<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">b) Non U.S. citizens do not qualify for government furnished medical evacuation service at no cost and thus will be responsible for obtaining required medical evacuation (medevac) insurance.

<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider. Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of contract performance. CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract.

<DESC><p>DESCRIPTION: THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>*** This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***</p>
<p>***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-34.***</p>
<p>***The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333314 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>This is a specification for the fabrication and delivery of one toroidal refocusing mirror for the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). This mirror will be installed downstream of the first end station chamber, which is in turn downstream of the monochromator of NSLS VUV beamline U4A, replacing the existing mirror. The purpose of this replacement is to provide lateral focusing (horizontal and vertical) of the VUV beam emanating from the U4A monochromator exit slit, with a longer focal distance than the present refocusing mirror. The goal is to match the physical dimension requirements of a new 3-D photoelectron microscope end station to be installed at U4A via a Methods and Instrumentation Development Team access agreement between NSLS/BNL and NIST, which is in turn collaboration with Browning Associates, Inc. Specifically, the distance from the center of the refocusing mirror to the focal point will increase from 0.6m to 1.0m. This mirror deflects vertically downward, at a grazing angle of incidence of 4.7 degrees. It resides in a UHV chamber, held by a manipulator that provides adjustment of height, pitch, roll, and with very high precision yaw.</p>

<DESC><p>Feasibility Study to determine the viability of measuring the impact of strategic planning.
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Division of Clinical Research (DCR), Office of Strategic Planning and Assessment (OSPA) contributes to DCR's mission by providing centralized organizational development services that facilitate high quality clinical research through: program guidance and support; strategic planning and direction; project management; technical direction; learning and professional development, and general assistance to the branches and offices within DCR. The OSPA consists of five work teams: the Strategic Planning Team having primary responsibility for facilitating the integration of a strategic planning process throughout DCR.</p>
<p>The OSPA employs a comprehensive model that integrates strategic planning, budget planning, learning and professional development, and project management. This integration of key organizational processes is focused on increasing efficiency and effectiveness to maximize resource utilization and enhance program results. OSPA aims to achieve this through the alignment of:</p>
<p>&#61607; Operational activities to strategic goals and objectives;<br />&#61607; Resource requirements to meet goals and objectives to budget; <br />&#61607; Workforce competencies to objectives;</p>
<p>With an anticipated start date of late summer 2009, the Office of Strategic Planning and Assessment (OSPA) is interested in conducting an evaluation and assessment study to determine the feasibility of measuring the impact of strategic planning within the DCR.</p>
<p>Over the last three (3) years a comprehensive strategic planning model has been integrated into several areas of the Division and therefore the Division is interested in determining if it is feasible to measure the impact of this strategic planning process in the areas of:</p>
<p>&#61607; Enhancing and optimizing the management of DCR Offices, Branches, and special projects<br />&#61607; Goal attainment</p>
<p>This evaluation must be guided by best practices and industry standards for performing evaluations and assessments of strategic planning.</p>
<p>SUBCONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS<br />1. Conduct an assessment and evaluation to determine and document the feasibility of measuring the impact of strategic planning in the NIAID DCR.<br />2. It is anticipated that the term of the agreement will be approximately twelve (12) weeks.<br />3.

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/STATEMENT OF WORK

A. Background

The Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility (PSEF) in Building # 2360 has an Improvement and Modernization (I&M) Program for the Rotor Spin Facility (RSF).  This I&M Program includes upgrading the existing control room data acquisition systems.  The RSF is comprised of four chambers which test rotor components in support of current and future readiness goals.  The testing consists of life extension, service issues, low cycle fatigue, high cycle fatigue, disc burst, and next generation.  The RSF provides valuable testing for DARPA, ONR, and all three military services.  As a result of failure of the NEFF amplifiers and inability to meet speed control test requirements, replacement data acquisition systems are required for all four test chambers/cells.  The firm requirements (salient characteristics) of the RSF Data Acquisition Systems are listed below.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1, including applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges added by a modification after contract award. The contractor may submit, on a yearly basis, a request for equitable adjustment for taxes, fees, and surcharges to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements.

<DESC>The response date has been extended from (July 14, 2009, 2:00 PM, Eastern time)  to (July 16,  2009, 2:00 P.M.) due to questions in response to Solicitation # 25174PCARD26 . 

Questions & Answers

Question 1:   Is the requirement to deliver a 100% complete system with all necessary cables and accessories so that it is ready to install and work or should I take the list literally and just quote the exact pieces on the list.  For example, the AIS transponder will need a VHF antenna to work but this antenna is not on the list.

Answer 1: The requirement is to deliver a 100% complete system with all necessary cables and accessories.

Question 2: The four radar systems with 10.4" displays list 3.5' or 4' open array antenna (48 or 64 nautical mile). You can have either option. Of course there is a price difference between the two.

Answer 2: The 3.5' open array antenna (48nm) is satisfactory.

Question 3: The fifth radar is to be "black box" which is fine but you specify an 8" monitor. There is not an 8" monitor in the Furuno product line except the new NavNet3D system which is a next generation system with different digital radar options. Do you want a generic 8" monitor? If so, are there any requirements for it such as waterproof, marinized, sunlight readable, resolution specs etc.? Even then there are not many 8" displays on the market. Would a 10" or 12" monitor suffice?

Answer 3: A waterproof, marinized, sunlight readable monitor is required. No specific resolution defined. The smaller display is required due to limited installation space on one platform.

Question 4: There is a capability listed of "display charts or radar." Does this imply that I should include chart cards with the quote or just the ability of the machine to read chart cards? If you want chart cards, what geography do you need to cover?


Answer 4: Machine will display radar overlaid with charts, capable of reading C-Map NT Max cards. Include Max cards (5 each) for U.S. East Coast and Bahamas.

Question 5: "USB interfaces" is a requirement.  USB is only available on the new NavNet3D system but this is an entirely different system than what you are requesting. It may be possible to use USB/Serial adapters to bring data from these systems to a PC. Perhaps you can tell me more about what you are trying to do and I can ensure we meet the end need with the hardware.

Answer 5: USB not a requirement. Initial discussions considered multiple interface sources as options, not all required.

Question 6: "Ethernet Interface" needs some clarification. The NavNet VX2 systems that meet the radar requirements have Native Ethernet via ruggedized ports. These ports are not PC style RJ45 ports. Do we need to add a hub to bid to provide standard RJ45 ports? Once again, it would be helpful for me to understand what you are trying to do and I can specify the hardware to meet the need.

Answer 6: Yes, add one 8-port hub.

Question 7: What is meant by "generate, display and output target tracks?" Are you talking about radar targets and ARPA/MARPA tracking? These systems are capable of this but you need to add some hardware and a high quality source of heading data? Should I assume we need to include heading sensors (you list a "GPS heading sensor" later in the solicitation but this is a quantity of one)?
Answer 7: Yes. We require the capability to automatically or manually acquire, track, display and output track information of targets seen by the radar. 

Question 8: Can you please elaborate on "send & receive track messages to external units." I want to make sure I understand what you are referring to as "track messages." Are you talking about MARPA targets tracking? Historical vessel position (trail) tracks?

Answer 8: Capable of outputting a NMEA 0183 $RATTM (Radar Target Track Message) type message or equivalent.

Question 9: What do you mean by "GPS heading sensor." There are basic GPS position sensors and there are also Satellite Compasses that us GPS type satellites to calculate and deliver precise heading data. I don't know which one you are requesting. A satellite compass would give the systems the heading data they need to perform ARPA/MARPA radar target tracking.

Answer 9: This is more accurately stated as satellite compass.  Q unit incorporating two (2) GPS sensors and a display is required.

Question 10: You mention several times "NMEA Ethernet." There really is no such thing. Some items are interfaced via Ethernet and some via NMEA 0183 or NMEA 2000 or in some cases you can choose how to integrate it.  I will assume for the purposes of the quote that it is either Ethernet or NMEA.

Answer 10: This is more accurately stated as satellite compass.  A unit incorporating two (2) GPS sensors and a display is required.


Question 11: Did you mean to request only one (1) heading sensor?

Answer 11: Yes. We require only one single heading sensor for development - see line 9.

Question 12: The AID module will need a VHF antenna to function. Should this be included in the quote?

Answer 12: Yes.  A VHF antenna is required and be included in the quote.

Question 13:  Can you provide an idea of what type. size vessel these systems will be installed in? In order to offer a 100% complete system including cables and accessories it helps to understand size of vessel to better estimate required cable lengths.

Answer 13: The smaller system will be installed on a vessel approximately 30-35' in length. Other systems will go on vessels ranging from 65-110' in length.


Question 14: What level of ICD documentation are you requesting? For example, is it your intention to control the radar from an external device (which would require manufacturer DLL's) other than the equipment multifunction displays or remote consoles 9as supplied in BB systems)?


Answer 14: The ICD needs to show the message structure and interface for any message capable of being output by the radar system.

Question 15: Is it your requirement that the 10.4" and 8" displays have the same functionality.

Answer 15: The desire is to have the displays have the same functionality.  The small display is needed due to the limited installation space on one platform.

Question 16: The solicitation 25174PCARD26, in it's title indicates the need for a coherent radiation system. There are no coherent systems approved to maritime protocols on the market down at the small size you are requesting. Would larger units be considered, or is the platform too small?

Answer 16:  We do not know where the reference for a coherent radiation system originated. Larger units would not be considered due to the size of the platforms.

4. "Since the contract will be a Fixed Price agreement, can we submit All-Inclusive rates for the various classifications?"

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.

INTRODUCTION

As part of OPS, the OFDA Safety and Security Coordinator (SSC) and Safety and Security Specialist (SSS) play a central role in the U.S. Governments (USGs) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management programs.  The Safety and Security Unit (SSU) assists the office in identifying, evaluating and mitigating safety and security risks to OFDA field operations.  The SSU monitors security issues and events, develops security strategies, protocols and procedures, and maintains a cadre of qualified security professionals available for OFDA deployments.  The OFDA SSU also promotes enhanced safety and security approaches in the wider humanitarian community, including NGOs and United Nations (UN) agencies, through their outreach and donor activities.

OBJECTIVE

OPS requires the services of a Safety and Security Specialist in order to enhance its capability to manage the increasing safety and security issues related to OFDA field deployments.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

	Monitor security situations in countries and regions in which OFDA has, or may have, staff.
	Provide general and country-specific security guidance and briefings to OFDA staff as needed.
	Conduct periodic site visits in support of OFDA/DRM and Regional Team safety and security needs, including comprehensive safety and security assessments and development of safety and security plans.
	Work with OFDAs Training Unit to refine and develop security related training materials as needed.  
	Assist in managing OFDAs cadre of Safety and Security Officers.
	Working with OFDA/DRM, assist in the identification and evaluation of humanitarian security initiatives to increase NGO and UN capacity to improve their overall security management. 
	Work with OFDA/DRM and Regional Teams to coordinate and track the activities of OFDA staff as they relate to security.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<p>5 each 3 X 7 aluminum man entry doors with panic hardware; two doors each side and one on the end panel<br />UL-Listed control panel</p>
<p>36 each - 400 Watt explosion proof lighting fixtures with that will provide 50 foot candle-power at 8 feet off of the floor.</p>
<p>Manufacture warranty for 10 years on all fabric parts</p>
<p>GSA class C for 40 PSF snow &amp; 110 MPH wind load.</p>
<p>Contractor will provide connection of utilities to the closest utility pole as well as the inside and or outside of the shelter as required for operation of all electrical systems.</p>
<p>Shelter design and installation shall mitigate bird roosting or nesting within the shelter.</p>
<p>Complete documentation and organization of all technical data, warranties which applies to the operation, maintenance, repair and testing of the specific equipment.</p>
<p>Provide training to personnel on the proper operation and maintenance of the equipment and its component parts.</p>
<p>A registered structural engineer for the shelter shall sign and seal his/her work and provide a copy of engineering calculations and with two reproducible, 36 inches by 25 inches, copies of design drawings. In cases where existing apron pavement cannot be used as a foundation, registered structural engineer shall design the shelter foundation.</p>
<p>Shelter is to be free standing and typically bolted to the existing concrete ramp pavement. In cases where shelter columns are positioned atop existing pavement joints or other cases where bolting of shelter columns to concrete ramp pavement is not feasible, contractor shall be responsible for installing new concrete column footings extending through the existing ramp pavement.</p>
<p>Lightning protection and grounding will be required in accordance with the Statement of Work</p>
<p>NOTE: The government will consider other types of shelters provided they meet or exceed the required standards and represent "Best Value" to the government.<br /><br />Due to mandated timelines, potential contractors will submit price and installation proposals for government consideration as follows:</p>
<p>Purchase and installation complete within 30 days after award:</p>
<p>PRICE: ________</p>
<p>Purchase and installation complete within 45 days after award:</p>
<p>PRICE: ________</p>
<p>Purchase and installation complete within 60 days after award:</p>
<p>PRICE: ________</p>
<p>Purchase and installation complete within 90 days after award:</p>
<p>PRICE: ________</p>
<p>Purchase and installation complete within 120 days after award:</p>
<p>PRICE: ________</p>
<p>ADDED: The government may require expedited delivery, extended work hours and holiday work; therefore these added costs should be incorporated in the proposal. The government will select the proposal and timeline that represents best value and will adjust the performance period to best match the government's requirement.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the only synopsis. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses. The resultant contract will be a Firm-Fixed price commercial contract that will include appropriate construction clauses and provisions. The North American Industrial Classification Code is 332311 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. The estimated magnitude of cost for the proposed acquisition is between $250,000 and $500,000.</p>
<p>Since material supply restrictions and on-site installation tasks will involve construction (i.e. alteration to real property--concrete ramp modifications, structural and electrical work etc.), in which aggregate labor costs for all trades will exceed $2,000, Davis Bacon (FAR 22.403-1) and Berry Amendment (DFAR 252.225-7014) rules apply. Successful contractor shall comply with all contract provisions, clauses, and other applicable laws and regulations relating to wages, fringe benefits, apprentices, documentation, and other requirements. Certified payrolls will be required from both the prime and any subcontractors working on the project. In addition, the contractor shall certify compliance with Berry Amendment when submitting a proposal.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHANGE FROM:</span></strong></p>
<p>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror, whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. In determining the best value, the government shall consider Price and Past Performance. NOTE: Past performance will be significantly more important than Price when being evaluated. Past performance questionnaire submissions will be required before the due date of the proposal. The government will query past performance references submitted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;********** End of Notice*******************</p>
<p>Solicitation: Project ZHTV0700191. This RESTRICTED ACQUISITION is set aside for HUBzone concerns. The Period of Performance is 300 days.</p>
<p>NAICS CODE: 236220. Size Standard $33.5M Renovate Facility Phase 1, Facility 20011. This project is phase I of a multi-phase whole building renovation plan. This phase includes complete replacement of all air handling units, the heat exchanger, electrical distribution switchboard and circuit breakers. All restrooms will be completely replaced, some in different locations than the existing. A new sanitary sewer line will be installed. The site of the work is Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.</p>
<p>Special Requirement/Considerations: The building will remain occupied during this construction. Many of the new utility lines will be above the ceiling in the corridor requiring the contractor to plan his work to meet fire safety requirements for egress. The air handler and associated ductwork replacement will need to be accomplished during the no heat/no cool time of the year requiring the contractor to plan ahead to have all his material on the site before he begins demolition. The restroom work will be phased to allow the occupants to have access to at least one working restroom at all times during the construction. All this phasing of work will require the contractor to be able to manage multiple disciplines in order to minimize detrimental effects to building occupants. Constant communication with the building occupants and the fire department will be critical. The main occupants of this building are Air Force lawyers and the OSI. An unscheduled power outage could cause a mission impact for these organizations and therefore is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Estimated Cost of proposed Acquisition is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 4.1102 and DFARS 252.204-704 "Required Central Contractor Registration," Contractor must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov/ , or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax: 1-703-696-0213.</p>

<p>TITLE: Cross-Domain Innovation &amp; Science</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 08-06-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 09 should be submitted by 15 June 2008; FY 10 by 20 Nov 2008; FY 11 by 20 Nov 09; FY 12 by 19 Nov 2010 and; FY 13 by 18 Nov 2011. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 1 March 2013, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Cross Domain Innovation &amp; Science (CDIS) group of the Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate is interested in secure, accreditable services to assist in sharing information between two or more independent security domains.</p>
<p>Key Terms:</p>
<p>Secure: The solutions must be highly resistant to inappropriate use, either deliberate or accidental.</p>
<p>Accreditable: The solutions must be able to pass appropriate accreditation procedures, such as DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP), Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/3, and/or the emerging National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) 8500 standards in its final form. (Systems will not need to be immediately accredited, but must make all reasonable efforts to retain the ability to be accredited via best practices and good security design, such as Defense Information Systems Agency's (DISA's) Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) series)</p>
<p>Need to Know: Not every user will necessarily be allowed access to every potential resource. Solutions must have appropriate measures to allow enforcement of access policies.</p>
<p>Sharing: Information handled through these solutions must be able to be easily shared with appropriate personnel and/or systems. This typically requires adherence to published data, security, infrastructure and interoperability standards such as those available from World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and/or Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) among others. In general, solutions should be capable of interacting appropriately via Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)/web service means.</p>
<p>Independent Security Domains: By default, each level of classification is required to run on physically separated infrastructures. Cross-domain solutions are the bridges between these infrastructures, and hence require an exceedingly detailed security analysis and risk identification.</p>
<p>General Focus Areas Applicable to all FYs:</p>
<p>MILS/MLS technologies: MILS &amp; MLS technologies are operating systems or equivalents which allow for trustworthy handling of data at different classifications. These are often core functionalities utilized in cross domain solutions. Examples of MILS systems include Green Hills "Integrity" Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) (as part of the current HAP effort) or Wind River's offerings. Examples of MLS operating systems include Trusted Solaris 8, Solaris 10 with Trusted Extensions, or Security Enhanced Linux (SE-Linux).<br />Object level auditing: Modern auditing is typically performed on specific events, such as accessing a new process, potential modification point, etc. This tends to lead to massive amounts of audit data, some with little or no security relevance. An alternate approach is to have data objects be capable of recognizing appropriately auditable events - creation, deletion, copying, etc - and report their occurrence to some centralized service(s). Such an effort would face an extreme amount of validation requirements to be accreditable.<br />Policy-based configuration: Most systems typically are independently configured, leading to difficulty in reconfiguring a network of systems to handle an overarching change. Additionally, most are directly configured, rather than being dynamically reactive to policy changes. Having systems being both centrally configured and reactive to policy changes could greatly reduce the administrative overhead of such systems. <br />Workflow Enforcement: Most systems are good at maintaining a workflow within their capabilities. However, few systems are easily adaptable to enforce new workflows across multiple systems, maintaining non-repudiation and auditability across each step. This general focus area seeks to rectify this gap.<br />Redaction: The ability to modify an information flow (either in limited formats, or optimally, in any format) to remove information inappropriate to its destination. The ultimate goal would be a system capable of automatically preventing inadvertent or malicious release of inappropriate information while not restricting the appropriate sharing of information. Further challenges include determining the point at which redaction removes the value of transmitting any resulting information, potentially reducing bandwidth/processing requirements for cross domain solutions.<br />Label/Metadata Validation: Being able to assure that the content (&lsquo;data') matches the labels and metadata associated with it. This is a dual task - not only assuring by (preferably automated) inspection that there is an appropriate linkage between specific data and metadata, but allowing for highly-trusted validation mechanisms to reduce the computational overhead, while still fulfilling the certification and accreditation requirements.<br />Improved/Reliable Human Review: Increasing the speed and efficiency of the human review process required on transfer of most information from a higher classification domain to a lower classification domain. Methods are expected to be highly variable, from machine comprehension to statistical techniques to hidden content mining and including many others.<br />Enterprise Common Operational Picture (COP) - An awareness of challenges, risks and problems to an enterprise is critical to being able to respond appropriately to reach resolution. As such, we are looking into how to generate a COP of the entire enterprise, regardless of classification. Note that there are some non-trivial operational and need-to-know issues involved.<br />Policy management: Being able to represent policies for access to system resources electronically, allowing for a simple policy change to affect the configuration of systems and networks. See also Policy-based configuration, above.<br />Service management: Given the growing interest in and support of SOA in the various domains, improving the management of such resources becomes increasingly urgent. Adding in the desire of many customers to form &lsquo;mashable' (read, rapidly adaptable by users) interfaces to critical data sources via SOA, this management requirement becomes even more critical. Additional concerns come into play when these single-domain SOA-based enterprises begin incorporating cross domain solutions. <br />Interoperable systems: Wherever possible, solutions provided to this BAA should follow open standards. Examples of these include the standards offered by the W3C, OASIS, Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC) and others.<br />Label Integrity &amp; Classification: Being able to appropriately label information is an early precursor to flattening the networks. As such, the integrity of the labels - especially classification labels - is critical in the long run. Various methods are being researched for this, from authoritative information servers to various cryptographic binding methods, and including other approaches.<br />Data Aggregation &amp; Attestation: A classic concern with automated data handling is the data aggregation issue, also referred to as the &lsquo;sources and methods' problem. That is, a document made up of multiple pieces of information may end up with a final classification higher than any of its constituent parts. Finding methods to assure this does not happen within automated, adaptable services is a major challenge, and finding methods to attest that it has not occurred increase the level of difficulty.<br />Data pedigree: Knowing information is important, but knowing where that information is derived from is at least as important in evaluating it. As such, there are many different ways to maintain the history (or &lsquo;pedigree') of information. Issues arise when one attempts to send this pedigree cross domain - either due to resources being unavailable (cryptographic key stores, for instance) or due to policies preventing such transfers. <br />Trustworthy labeling tools &amp; services: Given the importance of appropriate labeling of data in a flattened networking environment, the tools to add labeling to data become very important targets of malicious users. Finding ways to assure that the labeling is correct and not maliciously applied or reapplied become critical.<br />Identity management. Maintaining track of who has access to what resources is a non-trivial, but mostly understood challenge within a single domain. When this capability is extended into a cross domain environment, many critical issues immediately arise and make what seems reasonably solvable in a single domain quite thorny. Examples include need-to-know issues, such as: Do low-side users need to know about high-side users? When and why and how do you allow only appropriate information flows?<br />Storage of sensitive data with multiple owners: Given the focus of centralization of capabilities currently ongoing within the various communities (Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECC)s, Regional Service Centers (RSCs), etc), the issue of sensitive information owned by multiple disparate organizations being collocated on a single device becomes a potential showstopper. Finding ways to protect the need to know of the information at a level acceptable to all the various data owners in question becomes a very difficult problem, especially when you add in the modern need-to-share requirements.<br />Secure non-hierarchical data sharing. The Bell-LaPadula concepts (&lsquo;Write up, read down') work extremely well for hierarchical data classification schemes. However, we have many non-hierarchical data classification schemes in use across the various domains - releasability, caveats and code words are all examples of non-hierarchical classification schemes. What are the equivalents of Bell-LaPadula's concepts in such information spaces?<br />Appropriate discovery and subscription to data flows in other domains. A common theme across academic approaches to web services and SOA is discovery - sharing information about how to get information. This is a great advantage to the transfer of information, but is completely insecure. To allow for discovery of services in trusted networks, there must be some level of need-to-know enforcement built into the standard academic discovery approaches. <br />Disadvantaged (&lsquo;tactical') user support. The Tactical user is unable to handle the information load expected within the enterprise, as they are typically limited to the computer hardware they can carry or have mounted to a vehicle. Yet these users are still in need of many of the enterprises' data feeds, and are the ultimate reason for those enterprises' existence. How do we link these users back into the enterprises, given the challenges on weight, power, bandwidth, and effective time? (Would you rather have a soldier performing administrative tasks, or fighting?)</p>
<p>Specific Focus Areas for FY 2009:</p>
<p>Security Labeling Assurance &amp; Pedigree: Defining the standards, interrelationships, processing and security requirements for assuring appropriate labeling of information with metadata. The goal is to allow the Operating System (OS), applications, storage, and transport mechanisms to enforce appropriate access policies to information.<br /><br />HAP &amp; MILS Architecture Adaptation to W/S &amp; Mobile Platforms: Researching the High Assurance Platform (HAP) and other multi-level operating systems architectures such as Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) and Multi-Level Security (MLS). Investigate their performance with multi-level environments (such as Multi-Level Repositories (MLR), among others) in the interest of determining how they adapt to workstations, mobile platforms and other platforms. Addressing issues such as cost and benefit comparison, scalability, bandwidth requirements, the ability to integrate policy models, and system performance.</p>
<p>Cognitively-Assisted Cross-Domain Information Sharing: Applying cognitively assisted information technologies to assist in automated and reliable human review of data, automated labeling of data, and/or assisting human labeling efforts. Using knowledge based technologies, natural language processing, case-based learning and the like, providing assistance in classification labeling of documents and parts of documents. The goal of this technology is to assist users developing documents, users reviewing documents and data being automatically produced by mission applications in labeling textual data based on current information sharing policies. Another goal of this effort is developing machine reasoning to attach appropriate metadata labeling to support the transmission of data to other security domains. This technology should easily integrate into SOA for ease of use and accessibility for enterprise and cross domain information sharing.</p>
<p>Secure cross domain discovery of web services: Securing Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) or functionally similar capabilities for cross domain application, including implementation of need-to-know verification checks and related capabilities.</p>
<p>Secure cross domain data discovery, access and retrieval: Develop accreditable approaches, mechanisms, and implementations to improve and enable an enterprise-capable secure cross domain information discovery and retrieval capability. This capability should support the discovery, access and consumption of both data and services across security boundaries of multiple types, such as (but not limited to) classification, releasability, organizational and so forth. Information discovery and retrieval involves the search of data resources, to include across security boundaries, and the delivery of that information to the authorized requestor(s) regardless of their location. This effort is intended to support Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) where services publish and find registered enterprise services that can be used for consumption or retrieval.</p>
<p>Specific Focus Areas for 2010:</p>
<p>Information Security Metadata Formulation: Research &amp; implement a method to link data and metadata within and across domains in a trustworthy manner using accepted standards for metadata labeling and Service Oriented Architectures. This effort includes gathering security policies for relevant domains into a standardized, appropriately accessible framework, potentially allowing for single-point configuration &amp; assurance of multiple security domains. It also requires covering such problems as different infrastructure/authorities in one or more security domain(s) associated with the cross domain solution, differing releasability concerns, operational security concerns, and so on.</p>
<p>Dynamic, Adaptive Security Policy Expression, Machine Reasoning &amp; Learning: Development of a standardized multi-domain security policy system to automate the approval of policies and transfer of appropriate data and metadata across and between domains. This centralized policy system should be easily and dynamically adaptable to create, enforce, maintain, end-of-life, and merge ('harmonize') policies for two or more environments/domains in a secure and trustworthy manner. These environments/domains may be hierarchical and/or non-hierarchical. It must be built with SOA, C&amp;A process, and metadata labeling standards compliance. As this is required to be a SOA capability, it should not be reinventing capabilities present in the environments/domains it connects with, rather it should be leveraging those capabilities wherever possible.</p>
<p><br />Specific Focus Areas for 2011:</p>
<p>Trusted Information Sharing Across Domains: Developing an accreditable, automatable, multi-domain security policy, including provisions for adaptation to changes in policy, data, and requirements. The goal of this effort is demonstrating information sharing across multiple security domains with changing configurations.</p>
<p>Cross Domain Identity Management: Maintaining track of who has access to what resources is a non-trivial, but mostly understood challenge within a single domain. When this capability is extended into a cross domain environment, many critical issues immediately arise and make what seems reasonably solvable in a single domain quite thorny. Examples include need-to-know issues, such as: Do low-side users need to know about high-side users? When and why and how do you allow only appropriate information flows?</p>
<p>Data Aggregation, Mitigation, and Prevention: A classic concern with automated data handling is the data aggregation issue, also referred to as the &lsquo;sources and methods' problem. That is, a document made up of multiple pieces of information may end up with a final classification higher than any of its constituent parts. Finding methods to assure this does not happen within automated, adaptable services is a major challenge, and finding methods to attest that it has not occurred increase the level of difficulty. Once aggregation is detected, there must be a suitable process flow to mitigate and prevent data from leaking that information to lower security domains.</p>

<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge and experience within cross-domain environments, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any) - Including the matching of dollars proposed to the technology proposed; amount of travel and other expenses (such as subcontractors, equipment, computer fees and software). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: The Government may use the services of MITRE in an advisory role for the technical evaluation of proposals. The exclusive responsibility for evaluation and selection/non-selection remains with the Government. Representatives of the foregoing firm participating in the evaluation process will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals. Any objection to the use of any or all of the personnel identified above must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><br />The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The capability to work in a classified facility with classified data may be required. White Papers / Proposals should identify any cleared personnel and access to classified facilities for completing tasks outlined above.</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>

<p>Solicitation Number: FA4626-09-R-0027</p>
<p>Description: The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation at any time. Work consists of the contractor providing all labor, equipment, transportation, materials, quality control and supervision necessary to rebuild the parking lot servicing buildings 735 and 765 in accordance with the project specifications and drawings.

Procurement of Follow-on Maintenance support for this would include (8 hours) 5x8 next day phone support and SUS (Software Update Service) to include: Telephone/Web assistance, remote support and software update/upgrade services. ENM currently owns this software product so upgrades must be acquired by the same Indicative Brands.  If the maintenance and upgrades are not procured under the same Brand Name ENM runs the risk of violating our maintenance agreement and could incur copyright violations.An identification of the stautory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 41 USCODE 253 (C) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. A demonstration that the propsed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement. ENM currently utilizes the Indicative products and requires the maintenance support in order to provide updates and upgrades as needed.  The product we own "Indicative" is the property of Nimsoft. The only entity able to provide upgrades, bug fixes, or cover any issues with the product is Nimsoft. It's important we move on this to maintain our coverage for the product. The ILMS application relies on this product to identify performance issues throughout the network.<BR><BR>

<DESC>****PLEASE SEE ATTACHED FOR FURTHER INFORMATION****

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), is conducting a Market Survey/Request for Information to improve the Government's understanding of the current marketplace and to identify qualified sources capable of providing Performance Technologies' MPS1000 Communications Server for the MMAC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Interested sources must respond with information to confirm evidence of qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish an acquisition strategy.  Responses to this market survey will be used in part to determine whether or not adequate competition exists to set the requirement aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) or Small Business, or open it up for full and open competition.  Any interested sources may respond to this market survey.  The information gleaned from this market survey may result in a restricted Screening Process when the RFP is issued.  All decisions will be made based on the information provided by vendors responding to this market survey.  This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.  This survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will be utilized for planning purposes only.
The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 334519, Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing, with a Small Business Size Standard of 500.
The FAA intends to award a stand-alone Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract by October 2009.  
All responses (one per company) must be on company letterhead and limited to a total of 5 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 11 point may be used.  
BACKGROUND:
The MPS1000 is a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) piece of equipment in the ITWS rack that accepts input weather data from many weather sources, including the ASR9 radar, ASR11 radar, NEXRAD radar, TDWR radar, and the National Weather Service (NWS).   The ITWS was acquired by the FAA program office from Raytheon, beginning in 1998. The first twenty-two (22) ITWS racks (of the thirty-three total) were deployed by Raytheon with the Performance Technologies MPS800 Communications (Comms) Concentrator.  The ITWS software was developed to communicate with and control the Performance Technologies MPS800 device, to facilitate communications with various radars such as the ASR9, ASR11, and NEXRAD.  The MPS800 model became End of Life (EOL) in 2007, and it is no longer supported by the manufacturer. In addition, replacement units are no longer available when these units fail.  Therefore, the FAA directed the ITWS contractor (Raytheon) to deploy the last eleven (11) ITWS sites with the newer version of the comms concentrator, the MPS1000.   AJW-14A was funded by the ITWS Program Office to retro-fit the first twenty-two (22) ITWS sites with the new Performance Technologies MPS1000.   This retrofit is required to ensure that the fielded ITWS equipment is fully supportable and maintainable.
PURPOSE:
Responses to this market survey may be used to determine if adequate competition exists to set the requirement aside for Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or the 8(a) program in lieu of opening the acquisition up for full and open competition.
The FAA requires specific information from interested small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB), or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, as follows:
