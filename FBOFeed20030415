The University of Queensland also operates a short duration pulse facility (a free-piston driven shock tunnel) to obtain scramjet ground test data to compare with flight data. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 30, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

SOL BAA03-23.  This is a year long BAA – proposals may be sent anytime from date of BAA03-23 publication to 14 April 2004 .   POC: Dr. Robert Popp, Deputy Director, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Information Awareness Office (IAO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714.  Facsimile: (703) 527-3783, E-mail:  iao_info@darpa.mil (e-mail contact preferred).  Contractual point of contact: DARPA Contracts Management Office (CMO), B. Meyrowitz, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714.  Facsimile:  (703) 696-2208; E-mail: bmeyrowitz@darpa.mil (e-mail contact preferred).

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  
DARPA’s Information Awareness Office (IAO) is soliciting ideas that will imagine, develop, apply, integrate, demonstrate and transition information technologies and components for possible use in prototype closed-loop information systems to counter asymmetric threats.  Program outputs will exploit information to significantly improve preemption capabilities, national security warning, and national security decision-making.  The most serious asymmetric threat facing the United States is terrorism, a threat characterized by collections of people loosely organized in shadowy networks that are difficult to identify and define.  IAO plans to develop technology that will allow understanding of the intent of these networks, their plans, and potentially define opportunities for disrupting or eliminating the threats.  To effectively and efficiently carry this out, we must promote sharing, collaborating and reasoning to convert nebulous data to knowledge and actionable options.  IAO will accomplish this by pursuing the development of technologies, components, and applications that may become integrated in a prototype system.

IAO is seeking proposals that will advance its mission to preempt and prevent terrorist acts through the development of innovative information technologies.  Proposals should emphasize revolutionary concepts that extend the state of the art.  Such efforts may involve high technical risks which if enabled would provide commensurate high payoffs.  Offerors should initially be prepared to support the technical feasibility of their concept or idea, then be prepared to demonstrate and discuss successive phases leading toward technology development.  As such, proposals should include a base effort supporting the technical feasibility of the offeror’s concept or idea and pre-priced options or subsequent phases that further lead toward technology development.  It is envisioned that the base effort proposed will not exceed 12 months, and each successive phase or option proposed will not exceed 12 months.  Offerors should not propose total efforts exceeding 60 months.  Proposals that exceed 60 months may be disregarded.  Note that exercise of any option is incumbent upon the continued success of the research and availability of funding.

TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS:  
Proposals should fall within the scope of the topics described herein in order to be considered acceptable.  IAO’s goal for this BAA is to solicit revolutionary research and development to preempt terrorist attacks.  IAO has no interest in developing information collection technology. Proposals that involve the application of existing commercial products, describe solutions that do not clearly contribute to preemption, or involve collection technology are likely to be considered less favorably than those proposals that more strictly support IAO goals.  The following technology topic areas are of primary interest.

•	Collaborative Reasoning and Decision Support Technologies
•	Language Translation Technologies
•	Pattern Recognition and Predictive Modeling Technologies
•	Data Search and Privacy Protection Technologies
•	Biometric Technologies

Additional information regarding specific foci within these technical topic areas can be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  Additional technical areas and proposal instructions may be added from time to time via amendments to this BAA.



PROPOSAL INFORMATION:
This solicitation is a two-step process:   Step 1 entails the submission of a one (1) to three (3) page White Paper.  Step 2 entails the submission of a full proposal, as requested by DARPA.  White Papers will be reviewed by assigned program managers, and offerors will be notified of the evaluation results and whether or not a full proposal is sought.  Any offeror may submit a full proposal, even if its white paper does not result in a request for a full proposal.  However, it is inlikely that a proposal submitted under such circumstances will be selected for award.  White papers should be submitted no later than 1600 Eastern Standard Time, 30 January 2004.  Proposals must be submitted no later than 1600 Eastern Standard Time, 14 April 2004.

All awards will be subject to availability of government funds.  Awards will be made to those offerors whose proposals are considered most advantageous and offer the best value to the government.  The government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and/or join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
The evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance:

•	Overall scientific and technical merit of the proposed research approach
o	Is the proposed approach revolutionary?
o	Is the proposed approach technically sound?
o	Is the proposed approach likely to succeed?

•	Potential contribution to the DARPA IAO Mission
o	Relevance and contribution to the national technology base

•	Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience to perform the stated work  
o	Qualifications of Principal Investigators
o	Range, depth, and mix of expertise of the Offeror’s key personnel

•	Approach to Technology Transition and capability to transition the technology to the research, industrial, and operational military communities in such a way as to enhance U.S. defense

•	Cost Realism and Reasonableness
o	Is the Offeror’s estimate reasonable and realistic for the technical and management approach offered?
o	Does the Offeror have a practical understanding of the scope of the effort?

The evaluation criteria recognize that undue emphasis on cost may motivate bidders to propose low-risk ideas with minimum uncertainty and to staff the effort with junior personnel in order to be in a more competitive posture.  DARPA/IAO discourages such cost strategies.  Cost reduction approaches that will be received favorably include innovative management concepts that maximize direct funding for technology and limit diversion of funds into overhead.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:
Within the meaning of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.016, this announcement and the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) constitute DARPA's solicitation for this BAA.  Proposers must obtain the BAA 03-23 PIP which provides further technical and administrative detail for this BAA including the technologies of interest, evaluation criteria, funding processes, and formats of white papers and proposals.  Proposals not meeting the specified format described in the PIP will not be considered for award.  The PIP is not classified and may be obtained via the World Wide Web (WWW) at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/03-23iao or at FEDBIZOPPS.   Questions regarding this BAA or comments on the PIP may be sent to baa03-23@darpa.mil.   

The Government shall not be liable for the cost of proposal preparation and submission.  Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with this announcement and the PIP.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.

ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST:  Each proposal shall contain a section satisfying the following requirements:  Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in this section.  

It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  The Government intends to use non-Government personnel from SRS Technologies, Schafer Corporation and CACI, Inc. as special resources to assist with the logistics of administering the proposal evaluation and providing selected technical assistance related to proposal evaluation.  Support personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose.  Contractor personnel are required to sign Organizational Conflict of Interest Non-Disclosure Agreements.  By submission of its proposal, each offeror agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above.  Any information not intended for limited release to support contractors must be clearly marked and segregated from other submitted proposal material.

<DESC>NA This proposed procurement is Unrestricted.  SIC is 1542 and the NAICS is 236220.  The solicitation for the Expansion of the National Defense University located at Fort McNair in Washington, DC is being advertised as a Two Step Request for Proposal (RFP). This work under this project is required in order to provide an adequate academic facility to accommodate the consolidation of various functional elements of NDU.  This RFP requires separate technical, design and price proposals, which are to be submitted in  separate phases, and are to be evaluated on a Best Value basis for award of the project.   The project description and overall performance requirements for this requirement will be included in the solicitation package.  The design and construction criteria for this project will be included in Phase II of this solicitation, which will be furnishe d by an amendment.  The evaluation of the proposals will consist of two (2) Phases.  In Phase I of the solicitation process, offerors are to submit a technical qualification proposal only, without extensive design information and without a price proposal.  The full Quality/Technical Proposal (technical-design and performance capability) will be required in Phase II, after the initial short list of the most highly qualified firms has been established.  The “short list” will be limited to a maximum of five (5 ) offerors.  During Phase I, the Government will only evaluate the relative capabilities, and past performance of the competing firms.  Offerors should submit technical qualification proposals that are acceptable without any need for additional explanation  of information.  The Government may make a final determination regarding a technical proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the proposal as submitted.  The Government may proceed with the second phase without requesting further information from a ny offeror, however the Government may request additional information from offerors of proposals that are considered reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  A “Notice of Unacceptability” will be forward  to offerors upon completion of the Phase I evaluation whose technical proposals were determined to be unacceptable.  In Phase II, only those offerors who are short-listed will be allowed to design and price proposals. The evaluation in Phase II will be of  the offeror’s design and price proposal.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Large business firms that are selected to continue onto Phase II are required to submit a subcontracting plan at the time for receipt of their price proposals.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration's William J. Hughest Technical Ce= nter requires sole source Architect/Engineering Services from the incumbent=  contractor, TRC, in order to complete highly specialized, site-specific wo= rk in a manner that is both cost-effective and avoids unacceptable delays i= n meeting compliance schedules. The Center signed a Federal Facility Agreement (FFA) with the Environmental=  Protection Agency (EPA) establishing stringent compliance schedules for ac= complishing the investigation and cleanup of all contaminated sites on the = facility. The FFA imposes stipulated penalties of up to $10,000 per week ag= ainst the FAA for failure to meet compliance schedules. To date, 21 sites h= ave been substantially completed to EPA's satisfaction with the assistance = of TRC.  Only TRC has the considerable site specific expertise and knowledg= e in the areas of hydrogeology, soils, sediments, wetlands, biota, ecologic= al and human health risk assessments, as well as engineering design, to pro= vide FAA with a high level of assurance that schedules can be met and penal= ties avoided as the remaining 4 sites are completed.  TRC's expertise and k= nowledge is not transferable and would take an inordinate amount of time to=  be duplicated by another A/E firm.=20 In 2001 TRC began their largest and most complex investigation involving me= rcury contamination (Area U) in the sediments of the South and North Branch= es of Absecon Creek and Upper and Lower Atlantic City Reservoir, which has = created significant ecological risks.  The mercury concentrations in largem= outh bass from the upper Atlantic City Reservoir are the highest reported f= rom any freshwaters in the United States.  Unlike usual cleanup investigati= ons, no source area for mercury has been found despite extensive searches u= sing standard engineering methods.  Instead, investigators are conducting t= heir search of the available mercury clues using scientific and forensic te= chniques.  Area U is of huge consequence to the FAA overall due to its esti= mated $350M of environmental cleanup liability targeted directly at the FAA=  budget beginning in FY10. TRC is the absolute key to the successful comple= tion of a defendable cost effective solution for Area U because of their si= te-specific scientific and engineering expertise. Area U studies will be on= going through June 2008. In addition to Area U, TRC is in the final stages of preparing a remedial d= esign for the construction of extensive treatment facilities in FY 04 and 0= 5. Field changes during construction will require the reworking of complex = design calculations performed by TRC. As the designer, TRC can complete the= se recalculations with relative ease whereas a new A/E firm will have to re= -verify TRC's original work resulting in costly delays.=20 Current cleanup schedules and timeframes cannot be met unless TRC is kept o= nboard without interruption. Startup times to bring a new A/E firm up to ba= sic technical and engineering competency specific to the Center would be a = minimum of nine months at a cost of  $1M.  Compliance with the FFA does not=  allow for delays in switching contractors and noncompliance will result in=  substantial financial penalties being levied.  =20 Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management=  System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, FAA intends to award a single source co= ntract to TRC to complete, over the next five years, the Architect/Engineer=  services for the Superfund Cleanup Program. =20 A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your = company does not agree with this single source determination, please provid= e evidence of requisite capability to provide services that meet FAA's stri= ngent schedule and scientific requirements in a cost-effective manner.  All=  responses to this announcement must be in writing and directed to Phyliss = Schlegel no later than close of business, Monday, April 21, 2003.

A/E contractors will only have to provide this information once with annual updates or as key company information changes occur.  Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.acq.mil/ec; through any DOD Certified Value Added Network; or a paper may be obtained by calling the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NAICS Code 541620. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is intending to award a sole source Purchase Order to American Meteorological Society (AMS) Headquarters. The purpose of this acquisition is to provide support for AMS to conduct forums on improving responses to climate prediction, weather and public health. AMS is uniquely qualified to perform this requirement. AMS has been used many times by government organizations for conference sponsorships because of their established expertise in the field, their contracts throughout the government, the  private sector and the academic community.  When surveying the market, AMS was found to be the only organization holding national meetings in 2003-2004 that engaged the above subjects. It was also found that AMS was the only source that can provide public and private sector leaders with enhanced  information for responding to climate predictions and climate-induced health risks in a forum setting. Due to past performance, level of expertise and the lack of competition that can meet EPA's objectives, it is therefore determined that AMS is the only vendor able to fulfill this requirement.   The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  However, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will  be considered.  Interested firms shall provide detailed information outlining their capabilities.  Any response failing to provide the aforementioned data will be disregarded.  Responses to this posting must be in writing.  A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NAICS Code: 541620.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a sole source Purchase Order to the Public Health Institute of Berkeley, CA. The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain monitoring information sources on pollution concentrations from recently constructed buildings in which a substantial number of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) practices were utilized. This information will be used by the EPA to validate and improve its guidance on green building performance in respect to IAQ. Due to the overriding emphasis on energy efficiency, waste  minimization and resource sustainability so far in the green building movement, there has been a scarcity of buildings that address IAQ and limitations on emissions of materials and products purchased for construction. Public Health Institute, a contract vehicle for the California Department of  Health Service, is uniquely  qualified to perform this requirement. Proposed monitoring and analysis of the existing data is crucial to the IAQ guidance. It is therefore determined that the Public Health Institute is the only vendor able to fulfill this requirement.  The NAICS Code for this  procurement is 541620.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  However, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Only One Source Reasonably Available with Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, for engineering analysis of the multizone analysis methods implemented through CONTAM and Computational Fluid Dynamics.  CONTAM, a multi-zone airflow and contaminant dispersal model, is widely used to compute indoor airflow and contaminant transport in buildings for a variety of applications related to energy use, indoor air quality and most recently building safety. The model defines each space in a building as a single control volume.  Simplified Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD0) is a powerful tool that can be used to determine airflow and contaminant concentrations within those spaces where CONTAM would not function well.  Specific tasks include: (1) Development of engineering analysis approaches that couple CONTAMX (the calculation engine within CONTAM) analysis and CFD analysis using an existing, simplified CFD program in which the output from one becomes the input to the other. These coupled approaches shall address flow and pressure data exchange and other engineering issues.  (2)  Testing of coupling approaches in terms of accuracy, execution time and numerical stability.  (3)  Documentation of the coupling approaches developed and the results of the evaluations.
(4)  Recommending multiple approaches for implementing at least one of the coupling approaches within the CONTAMW version 2.0 interface.  The proposed contractor’s principal investigator, Dr. Qingyan Chen, is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering and an expert in building airflow theory and analysis.  He is familiar with the CONTAM approach developed at NIST and is the developer of CFD0, a simplified CFD analysis tool to be used in the research.  His research topics include computations and measurements of airflows in and around buildings (indoor and outdoor environment), building ventilation systems, indoor air quality, building energy analysis, research in turbulent flow and heat transfer.  He is recipient of awards from ASHRAE and the US National Science Foundation.  He was elected to the International Academy of Indoor Air Sciences.  His professional accomplishments, publications, skills, and training that support this sole source acquisition are fully detailed at the following website, http://widget.ecn.purdue.edu/~yanchen/  A labor hour purchase order will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competition; no solicitation is available, however, interested parties may express, in writing, their interest and document their bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  Such information must be received prior to the closing date and time of April 29, 2003, 2 PM EST and will be reviewed solely to determine if it is necessary to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP. The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. The utility systems being privatized are described as follows: Installation: Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi. System Descriptions: Electric, Natural Gas, Water and Wastewater.  The base size is about 4,410 acres. This includes 170 buildings and 412 family housing units. The off-base sites are about 1,080 acres total in size. The electrical distribution system is a 13,200 volt distribution system consisting of five distribution feeders. The capacity of the utility owned supply substation is 30 MVA, base peak demand is approximately 10 MVA with an approximate annual consumption rate of 43,000,000 kwh.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Description: NAICS 236220 (previously 233320)  Size Standard: $28.5 Million. Project No. NMA00154, Solicitation No. GS-01P-03-NLC-0022 Building Extension at the Hastings-Keith Federal Building, New Bedford, MA. This procurement is restricted to certified HUB Zone small business concerns. The RFP package will be issued only to certified Hub Zone firms expressing an interest in this solicitation. A list of those firms will be posted on this website. The estimated construction cost range is $1 million to $5 million. The estimated period of performance is 12 months.  This requirement is for the procurement of a construction firm to provide all management, labor, materials, and equipment necessary for completing a new masonry, one-story, building extension, at the existing Hastings-Keith Federal Building; originally completed in 1976.  The new addition will be tied into the existing building, which has a porcelain-enameled exterior panel system.  Construction portions will be phased to accommodate the tie-in of the new building to the existing building, which will remain occupied. The area of the new addition is approximately 6,000.00 SF.  The successful firm must have previous experience with size and scope of similar construction projects.  The contractor’s personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  Work includes, but is not limited to, site work removals, interior reconfiguration consisting of finishes, heating/cooling, lighting power and fire protection.  Construction work will include an IWS/LAN installation that will be completed in five phases in both existing spaces and the new addition.  The project is being procured using source selection procedures, which will result in a firm-fixed price award to the offeror who provides the best value to the Government. The procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the proposal that represents the best value to the Government.  For this procurement, evaluation factors are equal to price related factors.  Upon receipt of all price and responses to evaluation factors, a formal selection of a firm will be made. Failure of offerors to submit a response to the evaluation factors will preclude further participation on this acquisition. Evaluation factors will consist of 1) prior experience, 2) management capability, 3) past performance. Regarding past performance offerors with no relevant performance history shall provide information which helps to identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and local government and private) for efforts similar to the requirement as identified in  the attached Statement of Work.  Offerors should provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions.  The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror's past performance. The government’s evaluation will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. 
In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Interested parties may obtain a copy of the solicitation package, which will be available on CD only. The CD solicitation package should be available on or about April 25, 2003. You must fax your request to the attention of Frank Pfeiffer at 401-528-5114, or by email to Frank.Pfeiffer@gsa.gov.  All requests must be accompanied by a completed Document Security Notice which will be validated prior to issuance of the CD. The Document Security Notice is posted separately under this solicitation number. Requests will not be honored from any prospective offeror who does not comply with the Document Security Notice and identification of its status as a qualified Hub Zone business.  P.O. Boxes cannot be used as a mailing address. Interested parties may also request a copy of these documents by writing to the Contracting Officer at the following address: General Services Administration (1Pl-RI), John O. Pastore FB and USPO, Room 102, Two Exchange Terrace, Providence, RI  02903. A pre-proposal meeting is tentatively scheduled for May 16, 2003. The proposal due date will be OOA May 23, 2003.

<DESC>Solicitation number NA1341-03-Q-0337 dated April 10, 2003 is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted. Question: NIST's requirements states that "If, during the operation cycle, the pressure drop on the active filter vessel exceeds a preset differential between inlet and outlet of the filter, the system will automatically switch to the alternate filter." Later in the solicitation it reads "(18) Adjustable differential pressure changeover settings in the range of 1 to 7 psi." Also, it is assumed the system controls will be terminated by NIST since they will be 150 feet from the filtration system? Answer: NIST will mount the control box approximately 150 feet from the filter system, which includes running the cable and connecting it to the control box; thus, NIST requires the cable, assembly diagram/instructions and connectors (screw type, non soldered) to be included with the system. NIST wants an adjustable pressure switch with a range of 1 to 7 psi. The due date for quotes, April 21, 2003 @ 3pm EST remains unchanged.

<DESC>NIH intends to procure on a sole source basis to the Metropolitan Anesthesiologist Group, 10900 Old Coach Road, Potomac, Maryland, 20854 to provide Anesthesiologist Services.  The period of performance shall be for a basic contract period of twelve (12) months, with options to renew for two (2) additional six (6) month periods.  Specifically, the contractor shall be responsible for providing complete professional anesthesiology services to the NIH Clinical Center.  The contractor shall provide two (2) and up to four (4) anesthesiologist to respond to Clinical Center surgical scheduling requirements during the hours of 7:00am – 3:30pm, Tuesday through Thursday weekly with the ability to expand to five (5) days a week.  In addition, the contractor must supplement the primary call team with a dedicated back-up call team to provide emergency anesthetic services, including holiday weeks.  When requested, the contractor will be required to provide these emergency anesthetic services during non-regular hours within one (1) hour of notification.  It is believed that the Metropolitan Anesthesiologist Group is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements) because of the following:  First, the Clinical Center treats patients with complex, rare and advanced stage diseases who are enrolled in experimental protocols.  As a result, surgical procedures performed at the Clinical Center are very unusual, complex and are not often performed anywhere else in the country.  Anesthesiologists who service the Clinical Center must be proficient in all anesthetic techniques and invasive procedures.  In addition, all anesthesiologists must be able to treat all age groups and have a broad knowledge of all the rare diseases that are treated at the Clinical Center.  The Metropolitan Anesthesiologist Group has previously serviced the NIH and has the necessary skills as listed above.  Many of their physicians have provided anesthetic care for patients enrolled in NIH protocols in the past when the Clinical Center temporarily moved the neurosurgery program to Suburban Hospital.  Furthermore, their physicians are currently credentialed to work in the Clinical Center.  This reduces the need for training, enhances their ability to work independently and assures continuity of our operating rooms activities.  This is crucial due to the current shortage of anesthesiologists at the Clinical Center and the increased caseload.  Secondly, this anesthesia group works at Suburban Hospital, which is within one mile of the Clinical Center, allowing the Clinical Center maximum flexibility to substitute last minute surgical cases.  The proximate distance to the Clinical Center is also crucial in order to fulfill the requirement for a one (1) hour response time that is required for emergency cases.  Any one of the Metropolitan anesthesiologists who are credentialed to work in the Clinical Center could be called from Suburban Hospital to respond to an emergency immediately.  Emergencies do happen frequently because of the complex nature of the Clinical Center’s surgical caseload.  Finally, many of the Clinical Center cases involve huge blood losses, Suburban Hospitals designation as a trauma center ensures their anesthesiologists are familiar with cases that involve huge blood losses.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements or submit proposals to cbelt@cc.nih.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 22.

<RESPDATE>043003
<ARCHDATE>06292003
<CONTACT>Steve Dawson, 253-966-3500
<DESC>NA Machines are currently unable to fully nderstand human language. Highly restricted vocabularies of individual words may be recognized in a specific context, but overall the words are not understood in the way humans do. New methods are needed to resolve se mantic, syntactic, and even pragmatic ambiguities. Conventional approaches focusing on keywords, grammar rules, and simple probabilistic modeling appear to have reached their limits. Develop and demonstrate novel technologies, usable by anyone with or with out specialized linguistic knowledge, to automate the understanding of text and spontaneous conversation by mapping equivalencies in usage of phrases instead of focusing on the meaning of individual words. The approach is based on statistical modeling of h uman conversations. The goal is to construct a network of equivalent phrases of conversational English using algorithmic procedures that automatically extract a significant number of phrases from text and organize them into semantically and syntactically e quivalent classes. The same step will be taken for either Arabic, Japanese and Korean. A mapping between the two languages will be used to produce valid translations. The overall challenge is to build and validate a viable system despite the very large sca le of the challenge posed by natural usages, and to verify the heuristics for measuring the closeness between phrase meanings. If successfully developed and deployed, the new technology would provide the core language engine for a variety of applications i n addition to language translation, such as speech recognition and data mining. Speech interfaces could be built quickly and inexpensively, companies could translate product information easily, and customer service costs could be reduced through the use of  automatic question-answering systems.

<DESC>This PRDA is posted in two parts. This first part contains contact information, background, the program description, technical goals and technical approach. The second part, posted separately, contains contact information, the basis for award, deliverables, and proposal preparation instructions. CONTACTS: Ms Carol Lundin, ESC/ACW, Program Manager, carol.lundin@hanscom.af.mil, 781-271-8495, Capt Gregory Craff, ESC/ACW, Project Manager, gregory.craff@hanscom.af.mil, 781-271-3437, and Ms Barbara Lawrence, ESC/ACK, Contracting Officer, barbara.lawrence@hanscom.af.mil, 781-271-8075, representing the Air Force Weather Weapon System, Electronic Systems Center, located at Hanscom Air Force Base, are soliciting proposals for new and innovative solutions in weather model algorithms, weather analysis algorithms and meteorological satellite data ingest.  This is a single-step, 45-day, Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) to solicit research and development proposals for the Forecasting and Modeling program.  BACKGROUND The Air Force Weather Agency is the premiere source of weather intelligence for the US Air Force, US Army, Department of Commerce, Special Operations Forces and NATO/Coalition forces.  As such, AFWA is continuously making efforts to improve the operational production of weather information.  AFWA employs a team of scientists who are constantly striving to assess the performance of existing weather forecasting and analysis tools and techniques.  These experts also identify areas of improvement that will substantially improve the quality of the forecast products and their utility to the war fighter. AFWA has identified the following areas for improvement to be funded in Fiscal Year 2003 with the aim of improving or streamlining weather forecasting and analysis: -	Agricultural Meteorology Model (AGRMET) resolution improvement -	Interactive Tuning Tool (ITT) for cloud analysis from satellite imagery -	Meteosat Second Generation data stream ingest algorithms -	Nephanalysis algorithms -	Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) data stream ingest algorithms -	Optimization of current Mesoscale Model 5/Weather Research and Forecasting (MM5/WRF) weather models -	Research into the 4DVAR model initialization scheme for MM5/WRF -	Algorithms to fuse Special Sensor data into the WRF Model  PROGRAM DESCRIPTION This solicitation is open only to academic institutions or companies headquartered within the United States of America.  This effort shall not use or produce any classified information.  This effort will have funding for a performance period of a year or less.  As this is the first of potentially many related contractual efforts on the behalf of the Air Force Weather Agency, the vast majority of the technical output from this effort must be non-proprietary.  This must be done to ensure that what is learned in this contractual effort may be freely utilized by the Air Force to advance the technical base of the Forecasting and Modeling Program, and to advance the state-of-the-art of weather modeling, analysis and data ingest in general.  Outputs may be used by the Government to guide future contractual efforts, including contracts with other vendors.  The use of Internal Research and Development funding (IR&D) is invited, but not required, for consideration of award.  If IR&D is proposed, the proposal must clearly specify which portions of the resultant intellectual property and technical output from the proposed effort will be the direct result of funding from this contract versus IR&D.  Proposals that include IR&D but do not clearly make this distinction will not be considered for award.  As stated above, the vast majority of what is proposed as output from this contract must be made available to ESC and AFWA on a non-proprietary basis.  TECHNICAL GOALS The goal of this effort is to advance the state of the art in operational weather forecasting.  There are two primary thrusts: advancing the sophistication of weather modeling; developing new data ingest algorithms and analysis tools.  The individual technical goals of this solicitation are as follows: Increase the resolution (48km grid to 24km grid) of the AGRMET model and make operational. Speed up the cloud analysis tuning process with an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool. Expand the existing data ingest capability to handle the new format of the second generation Meteosat satellite, and integrate the data into the existing analysis tools. Create the capability to "now-cast" a nephanalysis in areas of low satellite coverage and make operational. Expand the existing data ingest capability to handle data from the TIROS constellation, and integrate the data into the existing analysis tools. Optimize the MM5 weather model, reducing the computational requirements by 10% to 15%. Establish the foundation of knowledge necessary to develop a unified 3/4D-VAR model initialization system. Improve boundary layer physics in the WRF weather model. Integrate special sensor microwave data into the WRF weather model. Contractors will be expected to conduct a mid-term program review for any task with a period of performance longer than three months.  This review may be presented in person at either a Government facility or contractor facility, or may be presented remotely via teleconference or video-teleconference, depending on the scope and needs of the task. In any task where the contractor is expected to provide support to AFWA to install software on development or production systems, the contractor shall propose a level of service appropriate to the complexity of the installation.  The support shall not exceed that of one on-site contractor for the term of each installation procedure.  The support shall not be less than telephone or email support during normal working hours during the term of the installation procedure with a response time of one working day or less. Any requested Government furnished information required to accomplish a task will be provided upon contract award, if available. TECHNICAL APPROACH  Each area of improvement identified above has a unique set of expectations: TASK 1:  For the AGRMET upgrade task, a three-stage program is suggested to baseline, modify the existing operational model and validate the results. Firstly, the contractor should acquire the existing operational software from AFWA, analyze the algorithms and code, establish the required inputs and outputs, develop a baseline test data set (consisting of up to 6 hemispheric data sets), and run the code in a test environment and confirm results duplicate those produced at AFWA given the same inputs.  The outputs for the current eighth-mesh results will also be baselined.  Secondly, the contractor should modify the GFP software to run on 16th mesh grid and produce 16th mesh output products.  The contractor should exploit higher resolution input data where it exists and ensure that constraints of the model physics are not exceeded.  All software should be maintained under Concurrent Versioning System (CVS) configuration control, and software changes documented, in accordance with ISO9000 procedures (if in place). The contractor should run the modified software in the contractor's test environment using the baselined test data sets and verify that the 16th mesh results are consistent with the baseline 8th mesh products.  Following successful testing by the contractor, the contractor should work with AFWA to install software on the applicable AFWA development system. Lastly, following successful installation on the applicable AFWA development system, the contractor should test to verify compatibility/integration with the desired AFWA production system.      TASK 2:  For the Interactive Tuning Tool (ITT) task, the ITT should visualize the result of threshold variable changes in near real-time (less than a minute) using a graphical user interface (GUI).  The contractor should review the existing tuning procedures and become familiar with the existing tools in order to understand the tuning process.  Specific ITT design elements will require the contractor to interact with AFWA/DNXM to determine the operation of the tool.  All software will be maintained under CVS configuration control, and software changes documented, in accordance with ISO9000 procedures (if in place).  The contractor should run the modified software in the contractor's test environment using test data sets provided by AFWA/DNXM.  Following successful testing by the contractor, the contractor should work with AFWA/DNXM to install and verify compatibility/integration of the ITT software with the Cloud Depiction and Forecast System (CDFS-II). TASK 3:  For the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) task, the contractor should develop algorithms to take advantage of the multi-spectral capabilities of MSG.  A three-stage program is suggested.  First, the contractor should acquire the existing Support to Environmental Requirements for Cloud Analysis and Archive (SERCAA) cloud algorithms documented in AFWA's Algorithm Description Document (ADD) in order to determine which algorithms may be modified to exploit new capabilities of MSG.  Following successful testing by the contractor, the contractor should work with AFWA to install software on the applicable AFWA development system.  Secondly, the contractor should develop new algorithms that exploit emerging capabilities (particularly the multi-spectral feature) that are delivered with the launch of MSG, code the algorithms using C or C++ programming language, then baseline the algorithms/code.  Following successful testing by the contractor, the contractor should work with AFWA to install software on the applicable AFWA development system.  Thirdly, following successful installation on the applicable AFWA development system, the contractor should test to verify compatibility/integration with the production system, Cloud Depiction and Forecast System (CDFS-II). TASK 4:  For the Nephanalysis algorithms task, the contractor should develop algorithms to make a "now-cast" predictive nephanalysis in areas of low satellite coverage based on the previously generated nephanalysis.  A three-stage program is suggested.  Firstly, the contractor should acquire the existing operational cloud forecast software from AFWA, establish the required inputs and outputs, develop the appropriate advection algorithms, develop a baseline test data set (consisting of up to 6 hemispheric data sets), run the code in a test environment and confirm duplicate results can be produced at AFWA given the same inputs.  The outputs for the current nephanalysis results should also be baselined.  These outputs should establish the regression test data set to be used in the next stage to verify correct implementation of the changes.  Secondly, the contractor should baseline the algorithms/code.   Following successful testing by the contractor, the contractor should work with AFWA to install software on the applicable AFWA development system.  Thirdly, following successful installation on the applicable AFWA development system, the contractor should perform tests to verify compatibility/integration with the desired AFWA production system. TASK 5:  For the TIROS data stream task, the contractor should analyze a series of problem reports that are preventing TIROS satellite data from being handled, solve the problems, then develop the ingest algorithms for the TIROS data.  A three-stage program is suggested.  Firstly, after reviewing all open problem reports and write-ups related to this issue for the CDFS-II system, the contractor should analyze the algorithms and code to determine the cause of the errors.  The contractor should provide the Government with a report that summarizes the error analysis.  Secondly, the contractor should modify the software to ingest the data from the TIROS constellation and produce cloud analysis output consistent with the guidelines set forth in the CDFS-II documentation.  These analyses should be merged with those currently generated from data output by the geostationary and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite constellations.  The modified software should be tested by the contractor for compliance with the CDFS-II documentation in the AFWA development environment.  Thirdly, upon successful completion of testing of the modified software, the contractor should install it on the production system to be used operationally. TASK 6:  For the MM5/WRF optimization task, the contractor should apply sound computer science principles to existing MM5/WRF weather model code in order to reduce computational requirements without invalidating the soundness of the weather model.  The contractor will work in conjunction with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The pre-identified areas for improvement are: Microphysics; Radiation physics (long-wave; short-wave); Boundary-Layer physics; SOUND for MM5; SOLVE; Convective clouds; Parallel overhead; AFWA-MM5 pre- and post-processors. The contractor may identify other critical areas for improvement to the Government for consideration.  The overall target benchmark improvement for this project is on the order of 10-15%.  A five-stage program is suggested to implement this task, with each phase producing a deliverable product. Firstly, the contractor shall develop and deliver a plan detailing exactly what routines to review, methods of testing and verification, and a migration strategy for transferring the improvements into operations at AFWA and into the baseline MM5 at NCAR.  The plan should include a cost/benefit analysis of the expected improvements compared to the AFWA operational configuration.  Secondly, the contractor should optimize MM5 modules/schemes presently in operational use by AFWA and fully document all altered code. The contractor should periodically update the cost/benefit analysis to reflect the actual performance of modified code.  Specific AFWA-MM5 theaters that do not meet the target benchmark improvement metrics should be further analyzed and documented.  Thirdly, the contractor should optimize MM5 modules/schemes targeted for future operational implementation by AFWA. Fourthly, the contractor should port/integrate optimized modules/schemes common to MM5 and WRF into the WRF modeling system.  Finally, the contractor should optimize any remaining WRF modules/schemes targeted for future operational use by AFWA.  Contractor personnel should travel to AFWA (Omaha, Nebraska) at the beginning of the contract for an on-site orientation. Travel to NCAR to conduct final code reviews, validation and verification should be conducted prior to completion of any set of phased deliverables. A list of modules/schemes that are in use or planned for future use is available from the Original Point of Contact (identified below) to any offerors wishing to propose against this task.  The modules/schemes are available from http://box.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/ and http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/user_main.html TASK 7:  For the 4DVAR model initialization scheme, the contractor should perform research to advance the state of the art of the 4DVAR.  The contractor will work with the National Center for Atmospheric Research to set the foundation for development of unified WRF 3/4DVAR system, with the aim of such a system being operational in the FY04 to FY06 time frame.  The contractor should conduct research and deliver studies on the following topics:  Major changes to WRF framework/3DVAR code required to permit unified 3/4DVAR system; Initial results of applying the "TAF" automatic adjoint compiler to selected WRF algorithms; Cost-benefit study of MM5-4DVAR run in both "full-fields" and "incremental" mode. TASK 8:  For the MM5/Special Sensor data task, the contractor should perform research to advance the state of the art in weather models and the integration of satellite data into those models.  The contractor should develop algorithms to integrate Special Sensor Microwave (SSM/1, SSM/T1, and SSM/T2) data into the WRF/3DVAR system.  The contractor should produce the following two technical reports: a detailed report of the instrument characteristics of special sensor microwave instruments, and a detailed report comparing two alternatives for utilizing data from these instruments. The contractor should also implement software for improving WRF physics in the areas of the boundary layer physics and cumulus parameterization.  The contractor should provide support to AFWA to integrate the special sensor data algorithms and WRF physics code into AFWA's development and operational systems.

<DESC>Synopsis for Market Research…

CMS has proposed the creation of a common appeals system, the Medicare Appeals System (MAS), to support new appeals processes for traditional Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) as well as for Managed Care (MC). The MAS Business Case Analysis (BCA) led to a recommendation to provide a centralized application by integrating single or multiple COTS and/or GOTS products through minimal development of custom code. It is anticipated that the functionality that would be supplied by the COTS or GOTS product(s) would include case management, workflow management, and data analysis.

CMS understands the key to implementing a COTS (or GOTS) based solution is flexible, negotiable requirements. The purpose of this market research is to capture candidate COTS and GOTS capabilities using a structured process, and to refine MAS requirements to be in-line with best government and commercial practices. The following system types may be candidates for MAS integration:
·	Document Imaging
·	Case management (medical and legal)
·	Records management (medical and legal)
·	Digital/electronic signature
·	Workflow management
·	Docketing
·	Data analysis
·	Report writers

CMS developed a web-based questionnaire to quickly review and assess COTS and GOTS capabilities. Access to this questionnaire will be available until 28 April 2003. The market research questionnaire is located at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/contracts/masmr.asp

<DESC>CEC Program (Corporate Exigency Contract)
Laboratory Product Lines Reagents, Clinical Diagnostics Materiels and Laboratory Supplies:

The Government is soliciting interest from manufacturers of Laboratory Clinical/Diagnostics products.  The majority of the items are testing agents and are used in support of clinical analyzers currently located and used by DoD medical facilities.  The items are used to perform chemical/blood diagnostics on patient samples.  During times of contingency, manufacturer's 'safety' stock may be inadequate to cover increased customer demands.
    
The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia's CEC Program contracts with manufacturers to obtain guaranteed access to designated items in specific quantities, that have been identified by the Services as 'critical' in times of contingency.  Contingency support not only includes DoD wartime medical materiel requirements, but also humanitarian, emergency relief and other DoD directed response efforts.  By partnering with Industry manufacturers, DSCP will obtain guaranteed access to 'safety' stock or increased stockage levels, that are maintained in the contract quantities, managed and rotated with the contractor's commercial items.  The Government pays the contractor a fee for managing the government accessed materiel as well as all program requirements.  The resulting contract also will serve as on ordering instrument,  under which the Services can place delivery orders for the awarded items in support of contingency operations.     

The DSCP recognizes the unique characteristics and challenges related to providing contingency support to DoD customers of laboratory testing products, to include shelf life and possible 'lot number' materiel issues and welcomes the opportunity for discussions with industry.  Interested parties are encouraged to contract the following individuals for additional information and to be placed on the government's source list to receive a copy of the future CEC solicitation.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Industry Day for Joint Tactical Radio System - Maritime/Fixed Site (JTRS-M/F) Cluster 3.
<DESC>The JTRS-M/F Industry Day #3 previously scheduled for  21-23 April 2003 at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), 4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92110-3127 has been rescheduled for 28-30 April 2003.  The following provides some key data. 1. JTRS-M/F INDUSTRY DAY #3 GENERAL SESSION.  The General Session will take place in SPAWAR Cantrell C (in the Old Town Complex) at 1300 PDT on 28 April 2003.  Any company that wishes to participate in this General Session must convey its interest to Mark Lopez, the JTRS-M/F Procurement Contracting Officer  (PCO), by e-mail at mark.lopez@navy.mil <mailto:mark.lopez@navy.mil> or or by commercial telephone (619) 524-7168 by 1600 EDT on 21 April 2003. Previously  registered attendees and companies who have requested one on one sessions in response to the April 4 announcement need NOT re-register. Please note that participation in the JTRS-M/F Industry Day #3 General Session is limited to six (6) representatives per corporation.  (Note that this is an increase from  the limit of three specified on the 4 April 2003 announcement.) Attendees are requested to provide their name, company represented, and citizenship. JTRS-M/F INDUSTRY DAY #3 ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS.  On 29-30 April 2003, Prime System Level potential offerors will be afforded a two-hour period of time to meet one-on-one with the JTRS-M/F Program Office.  During this two-hour period, Prime System Level potential offerors may present both their possible solution to  the Cluster 3 system (in accordance with the JTRS-M/F System Specification) and questions or concerns to the Program Office.  The Program Office will attempt to  address those questions and concerns, and may present its own questions to the potential offerors.  As part of these one-on-one discussions, the Government requests that each Prime System Level potential offeror be prepared to discuss the opportunities and  challenges and associated risks - from technical (including how a particular radio does or does not meet the JTRS-M/F System Specification), cost, schedule,   programmatic and acquisition risk perspectives - of a Cluster 3 acquisition strategy that includes a Directed Joint Tactical Radio (JTR) solution, such as the  Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) JTR.  (Data sheets on the MIDS-Low Volume Terminal and the MIDS JTR previously provided).  A written ` response addressing the advantages and disadvantages of an acquisition strategy that includes a Directed JTR component, such as the MIDS JTR, may be  submitted by the Prime System Level potential offeror to Mark Lopez at any time prior to the offerors one-on-one session.  2. USE OF NON-GOVERNMENT EXPERTS DURING ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS.  The JTRS-M/F Program Office utilizes non-government specialists for expert  technical and programmatic support.  The program office desires that these specialists participate in the potential offerors? one-on-one sessions with the Government.   These specialists are employed by the following corporations:  Booz Allen Hamilton  DCS  GRD         INDUS Technology, Inc.  Maxim Systems, Inc.  Scientific Research Corporation, SRC  Tele-Consultants Incorporated, TCI  add:  Science Applications International Corporation, SAIC  These corporations have filed with the SPAWAR Contracts Directorate (Code 02) a letter indicating their intention to neither compete for the JTRS-M/F contract as a  prime contractor, nor subcontract with or advise any vendor that may compete for the JTRS-M/F contract.  Employees of the above corporations who support the  JTRS-M/F Program Office have also filed Non-Disclosure Agreements with the SPAWAR Contracts Directorate that restrict those employees from releasing any  information received from potential offerors to anyone outside of the JTRS-M/F Program Office. I n addition to these corporations, MITRE Corporation, a Federally Funded Research and Development ,Corporation, also supports the JTRS-M/F Program Office.  The  JTRS-M/F Program Office is in the process of obtaining a No Compete Letter from MITRE, but at the time of the release of this announcement, this letter has not b been received.  MITRE personnel who support the JTRS-M/F Program Office have signed Non-Disclosure Agreements.  Because the participating Prime System Level potential offerors are likely to provide proprietary information during the one-on-one meetings, the JTRS-M/F Program  Office needs those offerors to submit to the JTRS-M/F PCO a statement on company letterhead indicating permission for JTRS-M/F program support contractors  identified above to participate in the offerors? one-on-one presentations.  As an example, the Government requests that this Letter of Permission includes a statement  such as ?(Insert Offeror name) permits employees of Booz Allen Hamilton DCS GRD INDUS Technology, Inc. Maxim Systems, Inc. MITRE Corporation Science Applications International Corporation, SAIC Scientific Research Corporation, SRC Tele-Consultants Incorporated, TCI who support the JTRS-M/F Program Office, to have access to any of  (Insert Offeror?s name)?s proprietary information that (Insert Offeror?s name) may present during its JTRS-M/F Industry Day #3 one-on-one presentation.?  The Government requests delivery of this letter by no later than 1600 EDT on 21 April 2003 to the following address: Commander, Space and Naval Warfare Systems  Command, 4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92110-3127, Attn: Mark Lopez, Code 02-33.  Alternatively, the offeror can submit this statement electronically to  mark.lopez@navy.mil <mailto:mark.lopez@navy.mil> by 1600 EDT on 21 April 2003.  The Government also requests that if a participating Prime System Level potential offeror objects to any of the above identified contractors attending its one-on-one  presentation, the offeror make its objection to Mark Lopez by letter or email at the above addresses no later than 1600 EDT on 21 April 2003.  SCHEDULING ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS.  The JTRS-M/F Program Office will make all effort to meet with all interested Prime System Level potential offeror?s; however, the number of one-on-one presentations that can be scheduled on 29-30 April 03 is limited.  Consequently, scheduling of the one-on-one sessions during  these days will be prioritized by the following guidance (in order of decreasing preference): (1) Prime System Level potential offerors who submitted written responses to the two previously released JTRS-M/F CBD announcements (February 2003 and March 2003). (2) Prime System Level potential offerors who submitted written responses to one but not both of the previously released JTRS-M/F CBD announcements. (3) Prime System Level potential offerors who did not respond to either of the previously released JTRS-M/F CBD announcements, but wish to present their possible solution for the Cluster 3 system (in accordance with the previously released CBD announcements).  If, due to time constraints during 29-30 April 03, the Government is unable to schedule a one-on-one session with a Prime System Level potential offeror that responds to this announcement, the Government will schedule a one-on-one meeting with that potential offeror at a future date at both parties earliest convenience.  Prime System Level potential offerors that are scheduled for one-on-one meetings during 29-30 April 03 can invite to the meetings representatives from those  corporations that comprise their potential JTRS-M/F teams.  Vendor interest in scheduling a one-on-one session must be conveyed to Mark Lopez, by e-mail at mark.lopez@navy.mil <mailto:mark.lopez@navy.mil> or by commercial telephone (619) 524-7168 by 1600 EDT on 21 April 2003.  By 1600 EDT on 21 April, the JTRS-M/F Program Office will contact each vendor by email indicating the scheduled time and location for the Prime System Level potential offeror?s one-on-one session.  ACCESS TO SPAWAR OLD TOWN COMPLEX.  All vendors interested in participating in the JTRS-M/F Industry Day #3 General Session and/or One-on-One  Session must coordinate visit clearance requests through the SPAWAR visit office.  More stringent access requirements may apply to non-US citizens and  employees of non-US firms.  It is the responsibility of the vendor to resolve such issues.  PARKING.  Parking at and around the SPAWAR Old Town Complex is limited and restricted.  Vendors participating in the JTRS-M/F Industry Day events are advised  to plan accordingly.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The anticipated release date of the official JTRS-M/F Cluster 3 Request for Proposals is in the summer 2003, with contract award anticipated for first quarter calendar year 2004.  The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this announcement or at Industry Day and submittals will not be returned to the sender.  (end)

It should be noted that because the government did not retain data rights to the technical drawings for most of the instruments, it is unlikely that any single contractor expressing interest in this effort will be capable of performing all efforts without subcontracting or otherwise teaming with current DMSP sensor vendors and government laboratories.  The government has published an information database on the Internet at the following website <http://www.losangeles.af.mil/smc/ci/sfs/>.  The site contains the current contract statement of work and other pertinent contract information, as well as the government points of contact.  Additionally, the government has provided a Statement of Objectives (SOO) from the current DMSP Space Segment contracts. The SOO for the upcoming DMSP sensor readiness and launch contract will be posted by 18 April 2003.  Information from present contracts is provided for informational purposes only.  Interested contractors should base their submissions on the SOO for the upcoming DMSP sensor readiness & launch contract requirements.  This request is for informational and planning purposes only, and does not constitute and Invitation for Bids or a Request for Proposals nor is it a commitment by the government to award any contract.  The government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.  However, interested contractors intending to submit packages outlining their plans must submit a complete package to Mr Robert Graham at Space and Missiles Systems Center/CIKS, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1126-A8, Los Angeles AFB, CA 90245-4659 by 3 p.m. Pacific Time on 9 May 2003.

<SUBJECT>80 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  The Committee is considering adding to the Procurement List: Enamel, Aerosol (8010-01-505-1962, Flat Black Enamel Aerosol Paint); 8010-01-505-1964, Flat White Enamel Aerosol Paint); 8010-01-505-1966, Gloss Black Enamel Aerosol Paint); 8010-01-505-1968, Gloss White Enamel Aerosol Paint); 8010-01-505-1970, Gloss Olive Drab Enamel Aerosol Paint); 8010-01-505-1971, Floss Red Enamel Aerosol Paint); 8010-01-505-1973, Gloss Yellow Enamel Aerosol Paint).  In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm’s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>A -- Scientific investigations of living donor liver transplantation using clinical information and tissue and blood samples from adult liver transplant recipients
<DESC>Collaboration in scientific investigations of living donor liver transplantation using clinical information and tissue and blood samples from adult liver transplant recipients in the areas of cellular and genetic aspects of liver regeneration; liver function and metabolic mass;  markers of liver injury and repair; treatment of hepatitis C; hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer); immunosuppression and  immune tolerance; drug metabolism; gene expression; psychometric measures of quality of life; electronic media for patient education; and other scientific issues relevant to living donor liver transplantation.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies) to investigate scientific issues in the recently formed Clinical Research Network termed Adult to Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study (A2ALL). The core theme of A2ALL is comparison of outcomes of candidates for liver transplant who receive or do not receive Living Donor Transplantation (LDT).  See http://www.nih-a2all.org/default.asp for more information and list of participating centers.  The potential Collaborator’s capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies of the relevant area of investigation and should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed, proposed methods, and access to potential therapeutic or diagnostic molecules. Examples of potential studies include: 1) Characterization of changes in LIVER FUNCTION, mass, and metabolic capacity during regeneration following liver transplantation. The impact of changing liver function on the immune response as well as its effect on metabolism of immunosuppressants could be investigated using novel biochemical and imaging techniques.  2) Identification of host GENETIC FACTORS associated with LIVER REGENERATION and the syndrome of graft failure due to inadequate liver mass.  This will require the identification of genes involved in successful liver regeneration in humans, as well as pathophysiologic events in the failure of grafts. 3) Assessment of the interrelationship of LDT with IMMUNOSUPPRESSION.  Cylosporine, tacrolimus, and other immunosuppressive drugs have been associated with proliferative effects which impact liver regeneration. In addition, changes in liver function affect the pharmacokinetics of most immunosuppression.  4) Exploration of serum markers for LIVER INJURY and repair to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical and laboratory variables.  Also, the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in treatment trials.  5) Evaluation of the impact of liver regeneration on the KINETICS OF VIRAL REPLICATION in subjects with HEPATITIS C, and the impact of INTERFERONS and other therapeutic molecules on these phenomena.  6)  Prevention of liver injury from recurrence of hepatitis C in LDT recipients by pre- and post-transplant TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS C.  7)  Improved staging and treatment of HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA.  8)  Develop GENE EXPRESSION ARRAYS that are diagnostic of liver regeneration and repair and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, STEATOSIS AND FIBROSIS in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.  9)  Study novel approaches to tolerance induction in a defined cohort of patients being prepared for elective transplantation from living donors.  10) Study the process of INFORMED UNDERSTANDING of living liver donors using ELECTRONIC MEDIA EDUCATION technology to provide patient information and correlate understanding with outcomes.  11) Development of effective PSYCHOMETRIC INSTRUMENTS to evaluate the QUALITY OF LIFE effects of living donation in this cohort of patients who will be followed long term. 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  STUDY GOAL:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with LDT using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy patients undergoing liver transplantation and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a structured, prospective database on patients who are evaluated for LDT and either undergo LDT or instead, for various reasons, receive cadaveric livers or do not undergo transplantation at all.  Blood and tissue samples will be collected from all donors and recipients at pre-determined time points. 
Applicants to support this study must include a description of investigators and staff that would facilitate collaboration in multicenter clinical studies of liver transplant patients.  Applicants should provide a detailed description of the methods and drugs which might be used.  A description of the laboratory tests that are needed including assays to determine levels of target molecules or the genes encoding them along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  Also included should be the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.  If an intervention is proposed, how the drug or product will be sent to each participating center as well as packaging, storing, and accountability issues must be presented.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the collaborator’s capability statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria: 1) The statement should provide specific details of the methods to be utilized and clearly describe important issues surrounding the proposed tests and technology. 2) The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the required materials or agents in a timely manner for the duration of the study.  3) The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to treatment and evaluation of LDT, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development. 4) The statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results.

DATES:  Only written capability statements received by NIDDK by close of business May 15, 2003, will be considered.   Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement will be invited at the Applicants’ own expense to discuss their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Study’s Steering Committee in Washington D.C. on May 29-30, 2003.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a request for quotation.  Submit offers on RML-RFQ-3023.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13 dated 04/17/03. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325414 and the small business size is 500 employees. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Laboratory of Intracellular Parasites requires the determination of the chemical sequence of the DNA of Chlamydia trachomatis, which will include sequencing, assembly and professionally annotating a Chlamydia genome to total completion. Genome sequencing involves two phases.  Phase I:1)library, 2)10X shotgun sequencing, 3)assembly, 4)annotation and ERGO incorporation. Phase II:1)genome finishing and assembly, 2)final annotation and final ERGO incorporation.  Independently, and not as an agent for the government, the contractor shall provide to LICP, services from qualified and experienced personnel. Labor categories shall include: Project Manager, Bioinformatics Scientist, Software engineer, Technical Personnel, and others as may be suggested by the vendor and approved by the Project Officer. This is an 8-12 month, one time work effort, where the final product will be the complete sequence of a Chlamydia genome with Q40 or higher quality per base.  Files must be compatible, transferable to and readable by the bioinformatics software and RML computing systems and infrastructure which involves a Finch server (www.geospiza.com), ERGO server and other RML systems, which are PC, MAC and Unix/Linux-based.   PHASE I: Library, 10X, gap closure, assembly, annotation/comparison, ERGO incorporation with the following deliverables: 1) One plasmid library where >90% clones contain inserts at, or larger than 2kb. 2) Sequencing reaction trace data for all reads shall be in SCF format and shall be posted on the Contractor’s secure server available for FTP download.  The trace data shall be readable by our Finch server and standard sequence editing software. 3)Purified plasmid DNA of sequenced clones shall be available for shipment to RML in 96-well plate format on dry ice within 24hrs of notice of request for those DNAs.  4) Flat file of the assembly at 5 to 20 contigs per 1 Mb. Delivery of the preliminary annotation and unique/conserved comparison results in flat file format on CD, along with RML-ERGO data incorporation by secure tunnel.  STEP 1) Library construction.  The Chlamydia genome is estimated to be approximately 1.01MB in size, with zero to two extrachromosomal plasmid-like elements.  LICP will send to the contractor purified genomic DNA for library construction. The contractor shall use this DNA to construct a library using the plasmid vector pGEM-3Z. DNA will be fragmented using a sterile, computer controlled shearing device to achieve an average DNA fragment size of 2 KB. Ninety percent or greater cloning success of 2kb fragment representation in the clones shall be achieved. Progressive assemblies of the incoming data shall begin after the first 1,000 clones from the library have been sequenced to test quality and randomness of the library.  STEP 2) 10X shotgun sequencing. The colony picking robot shall be capable of picking at least 3,000 colonies per hour. Each clone shall receive an individual name reflecting the organism, library, the cloning attempt, the plate ID and position. Cultures shall be processed for DNA mini-preps using robots for plasmid extraction and purification steps.  96 well plates with purified plasmid DNAs shall be stored in dedicated, specific freezers. IDs of the 96- well plates shall transfer to the 384-well format for tracking. Sequencing reactions shall be performed using the ET MegaBACE Dye Terminator Kit (Applied Biosystems). Test reactions shall be optimized prior to loading the bulk of the 10X reactions for sequencing. Passing sequencing reactions shall average at least 400 bases or longer of average Q20 or higher quality per read. A minimum of approximately 22,000 sequencing reactions at 400 bases or longer at Q20 average quality or higher per read, shall be performed.  5,000 reads or more shall be performed each day. The assembly shall produce between 100 and 250 contigs or gaps per genome. The contractor shall compute a size estimate of the genome. LICP recognizes that genome size is an unknown and may vary from the 1.01MB estimate. If the total number of runs brings the coverage to slightly greater than 10X, this extra coverage will be useful to LICP.  The total number of runs per genome shall not exceed 22,000 without written approval by the RML LICP Project Officer. STEP 3) Primary assembly.  Assembly shall be performed using Phred/Cross_match/Phrap. The contractor shall have additional in-house tools to help the preparation of the data for assemblies. The assembly dynamics shall be monitored and compared with models. The integrity of the assemblies shall be checked using either in-house or commercial tools. The assembled data shall be annotated and compared against all known related species/strains publicly available.  A list of unique and conserved ORFs for each genome shall be produced and delivered to RML, LICP.  10X sequencing reads and assemblies shall be delivered and must be compatible with our Finch server (www.geospiza.com). STEP 4) Genome Finishing, annotation and comparison, RML-ERGO incorporation.  Following several rounds of primer-walking and manual editing of read and contig sequences, additional sequencing or PCR shall also be used to verify and correct the assembly.  Full, automated analysis involving ORF calling, gene annotation and functional reconstruction of the genome shall be performed.  Three rounds of functional assignments for all genes shall be performed. Manual analysis by human experts shall be performed. Chromosomal clustering shall be performed in the absence of sequence similarity. The contractor cellular database shall contain 5,000 or more cellular pathways. The contractor shall determine which functions are expected to be present in this organism, yet have escaped identification.  The contractor shall identify those ORFs or pathways that are present or not present by comparing known genomes available for Chlamydia.   The data shall be transferred into the RML-ERGO server by secure tunnel and be compatible and viewable in all formats and annotations currently in the RML-ERGO server at this time.  Duration of PHASE I: Not to exceed 14 weeks.  The Project Director shall provide Status/progress reports to the RML Project Officer on a weekly basis by e-mail.  PHASE 2: Genome finishing, final assembly, final annotation, RML-ERGO data incorporation, with the following deliverables: 1) All trace data for all primer-walking/finishing reactions performed during this phase.  These reactions shall be in SCF format and shall be posted on the contractor’s secure FTP site for download.  The trace data will be readable by any standard sequence editing software. 2) Single contig per genetic element at Q40 or higher quality per base following final assembly.  The assembled sequence shall be converted to flat file format and delivered to RML on a CD. 3) Gene annotation/comparison data shall be converted to flat file format and delivered to RML on the CD described above. 4) A list of all-unique and conserved ORFs and intergenic sequences for the sequenced genome as compared to all publicly available Chlalmydia genomes shall be provided in flat file format on the CD described above. RML-ERGO data incorporation by secure tunnel of the genome data shall also be performed. STEP 1) Genome finishing/polishing, Gap Closure, assembly. The contractor shall perform gap closing, genome polishing and genome finishing. Manual analysis and verification of each base pair in the consensus shall be performed. Contractor algorithms shall be used for verification of the assembly. Additional sequencing from the chromosome and PCR products shall be performed. The final result shall be one high quality contig corresponding to the chromosome of the Chlamydia genome, and 1 or 2 contigs corresponding to extra chromosomal elements, if present.  Quality of the individual bases shall be at Q40 or higher throughout the genome sequence.  STEP 2) Final annotation, RML-ERGO incorporation. Three rounds of ORF functional assignments shall be performed involving predicting the gene function based on ortholog and protein family clusters, manual analysis by human bioinformatisists and analysis of functions expected to be present, yet have escaped identification. The contractor shall have 5,000 cellular pathways for comparison.  This database will allow for construction of the “in silico” reconstruction of the organism. Arguments shall be made regarding why a particular function may be absent in a given pathway. A significant increase in the function prediction coverage (on average 10-20% for the genome), shall be produced as compared to publicly available annotations.  The data shall be transferred into the RML-ERGO server by secure tunnel.  The data shall be compatible with the 80+ genome data currently in the RML-ERGO server at this time.  Duration of the PHASE II:  Not to exceed 4 months from the moment of completion of Phase 1. The Project Director shall provide status/progress reports to the RML Project Officer on a weekly basis by e-mail.  FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.
