<DESC>RECOVERY--Amended Solicitation Notice   This solicitation is issued as an unrestricted Request for Proposal for Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) for Design-Build and Design Bid Build Construction Services, Southwestern Region.  This solicitation will be evaluated under the Design-Build two-phase process utilizing best value trade-off acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>The Galveston District intends to award two or more Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) under the Unrestricted pool, with an estimated workload value of approximately $495,000,000.00 for SWG and SWD customers as follows:  Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area.  The contracts will contain a base period plus four one-year options for the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build and construction services with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $100 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3 thousand.  The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted MATOCs is $3000 and it only applies to the base period. <BR><BR>The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  The solicitation will be a two-phase negotiated acquisition; there will not be a public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government.  <BR><BR>It is anticipated that the majority of the work will be limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  However, because SWD Services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered, therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical areas as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.  <BR><BR>Scope of Work:  The MATO contracts are intended for multi-tasking of horizontal construction services for a wide variety of new construction, maintenance, repair, and alteration projects for Civil, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) Projects.

There must be more than two awards to create a Historically Under-Utilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), 8(a) Small Disadvantaged (SDB) or unrestricted to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless not set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be award.  <BR><BR>In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the Product Delivery Team will consider 10 the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.<BR><BR>Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors.  However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the four contractor pools.  All contracts will remain active unless or until: 1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.<BR><BR>It is anticipated that one or more of the task orders under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.  <BR><BR><BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two-Phase Design Build Process.  The first phase consists of a process known in the commercial design-build industry as the Request for Qualifications or acronym:  RFQ.  (This solicitations refers to it as Phase1.)

The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposal in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will short-list no more than five of the Phase 1 Offerors to compete for the design-build MATO contracts in Phase 2 of the process.<BR><BR>In Phase 2 the selected Offeror's will submit the remainder of the technical/ performance capability proposals and a price proposal for a seed project.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation and award the contracts to the responsible Offerors whose proposal conforms with all terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government considering technical design quality, performance capability and/or cost.<BR><BR>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 237990 (Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction) which corresponds to Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 1629.
