<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Pacific Northwest Region, 1150 N Curtis Rd, Boise, ID 83706-1234, intends to negotiate a contract with the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI) for the acquisition of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) digital terrain data in the vicinity of Scoggins Dam near Forest Grove, Oregon.  This acquisition is not subject to FAR Part 36.6 Architect-Engineer Services requirements and will be conducted using FAR Parts 12 and 13 procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541360, Geophysical Surveying and Mapping Services, and the small business size standard is $4.5 million.
Reclamation is conducting dam safety studies of the Scoggins Dam to examine its performance during large earthquakes.  Of particular interest is the Gales Creek fault zone which consists of three individual fault segments that have been mapped in very close proximity to the dam by the U.S. Geological Survey.  Reclamation is acquiring detailed terrain data for the Gales Creek fault zone using airborne LiDAR technology in the Tualatin River Basin and adjacent areas.  DOGAMI has embarked on an extensive, multi-year LiDAR mapping project in western Oregon with a multitude of local federal, state, county and local agencies partnering to meet a variety of mapping needs.  DOGAMI has contracted through a nationwide, competitive bid process to perform the LiDAR mapping, including quality assurance requirements.  DOGAMI is presently performing  Willamette River Valley Phase 1 mapping which encompasses about 2,800 square miles in west central Oregon.  Reclamation intends to partner with DOGAMI to acquire LiDAR data for the Gales Creek Valley fault segment (about 121 square miles) as part of this mapping project to realize a substantial cost savings compared to independently acquiring the data.  This partnership will take advantage of Phase 1 LiDAR data acqusition activities scheduled for Fall 2008.
Interested parties may identify their capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to Robert Milette via email at rmilette@pn.usbr.gov or fax to 208-378-5108.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by November 14, 2008, will be considered by Reclamation.  Information received will be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by Reclamation to not compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation.

<DESC>Contracting Office AddressChicago Office9800 South Cass AvenueArgonne, IL  60439DescriptionThe U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking a contractor to manage andoperate Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in Upton, New York.  BNL is aDOE-sponsored Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC)whosefacilities consist of 341 Government-owned buildings, equipment, and otherfacilities on a 5,320-acre site that is located on Long Island, New York.Brookhaven has a staff of approximately 2,700 scientists, engineers,technicians and support staff and serves over 4,000 guest researchersannuallyat the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) facility and the NationalSynchrotron Light Source (NSLS).  Additional information regarding BNL maybefound on its website at www.bnl.gov.DOE expects to award a new performance-based contract during the firstquarterof Fiscal Year 2010.  Anticipated annual funding for this contract isapproximately $540 million.  The contract will have a base period of fiveyears.  As performance incentives, the contract will contain an annualawardfee and a non-monetary performance incentive which will allow the selectedofferor to earn up to an additional fifteen years of contract term forexemplary performance.  The potential term of the new contract is 20 years.Following a sixty day transition period, the selected offeror will beexpectedto fully assume all management and operating responsibilities.Established in 1947, BNL originated as a nuclear science facility.  Today,BNLmaintains a primary mission focus in the physical sciences, energysciences,and life sciences, with additional expertise in environmental sciences,energytechnologies, and national security.As a multi-program laboratory, BNLs mission is diverse. However, theprincipalobjectives have remained the same over the sixty years BNL has been inoperation.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract entitled Oil and Gas Infrastructure in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  The MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement type contract for the effort described herein but may consider other proposed types if determined appropriate.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.  The contractor must be capable of performing all of the tasks described below.  The period of performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to be not more than 18 months, with an estimated cost range between $375,000 and $450,000.  This action is subject to the availability of funds.
BACKGROUND:The backbone of all offshore energy development is the supporting infrastructure in coastal areas of the region.  This onshore support infrastructure is also the location of, or vector for, the majority of the oil and gas industrys ecological and socioeconomic effects.  The Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) is a frontier area that hosts much petroleum-related infrastructure, such as oil and gas pipelines, refineries, and petrochemical plants, but these are part of onshore processing and distribution systems or related to the importation of foreign oil.  The area has much infrastructure, such as ports, shipbuilding yards and fabrication plants, that couldwith more or less adjustmentengage in offshore-related activities but that currently are employed otherwise.  The area also lacks certain types of infrastructure that are needed for offshore petroleum development, such as specialized ones like pipecoating yards or ones with a limited geographic reach such as coastal heliports.  Since, currently, the Atlantic hosts neither offshore petroleum activities nor infrastructure engaged in supporting it, this study addresses existing and future infrastructure in the context of possible OCS oil and gas exploration, development and production
PURPOSE:The MMS seeks to develop relevant information and analysis for the Mid Atlantic region on offshore oil and gas infrastructure that will support planning, decision making and environmental assessment related to the management of petroleum resources on the OCS.  Beyond describing existing infrastructure that would support potential OCS oil and gas related activities and the infrastructure types that may be needed to support these activities, the goal of this study is to consider the range of potential infrastructure responses (e.g., additions, modification, growth) to new demands related to the support of OCS oil and gas projects in the Mid-Atlantic.  
SCOPE OF WORK:This study will identify all facets of onshore infrastructure, existing and potentially needed, that may support oil and gas projects on the Atlantic OCS, including current capacities, demands, and anticipating trends as a response to future oil and gas exploration and potential development.  For Task 1, the contractor shall identify, acquire, and review literature related to the analytical questions to be addressed in the study.    For Task 2, the contractor shall produce a structured, annotated bibliography of key study references. For Task 3, the contractor shall create a descriptive analytical framework to serve essentially as a draft outline of the Fact Book, including the types of infrastructure and what information about each type of infrastructure will be collected and synthesized.  For Task 4, the contractor shall collect and verify location information for each facility that is of an infrastructure type that would potentially support OCS oil and gas projects. The Contractor shall collect pertinent information on each infrastructure type that follows the parameters established in Task 3.  For Task 5, the contractor shall conduct data analysis and develop a fact book about oil and gas infrastructure in the study area.  This document shall include:  a general discussion of oil and gas support infrastructure needed to find, develop and produce oil and gas on the OCS; a description of the currently existing infrastructure and its specific locations in the region; an analytical discussion of the trends in the region and the types and characteristics of future infrastructure development that may occur.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the electric distribution system for the Pennsylvania Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located at Pittsburgh International Airport (IAP), to Duquesne Light Company.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. Duquesne Light Company (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The electric system being privatized is described as follows: The Pennsylvania Air National Guard 171st Air Refueling Wing (ARW) is located at the Pittsburgh International Airport, approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown Pittsburgh in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and its primary mission is to provide aerial in-flight refueling and cargo transportation. The 171st ARW base employs full-time personnel during regular weekday shifts and Traditional guardsmen that are on the installation during their respective Unit Training Assembly (UTA) weekends.  The UTA weekend occurs one weekend each month for each unit. The 171stARW occupies 176 acres leased from the Allegheny County Department of Aviation.  Construction of the base began in 1949 for the 112th Fighter Group.  After several unit and mission changes at the PA ANG, the 171st moved to the current base in 1964.  The 171st maintains a mixture of mostly industrial and some administrative buildings.  Major additions or deletions to the installation are not planned at this time. Electricity is provided to the 171st ARW through multiple lines owned and maintained by Duquesne Light Company.  The lines enter a three-phase transformer and are stepped down to 4.16 kV for primary distribution to the Base.  Electrical power for the Base is metered at an on-base substation.  Government ownership starts at the substation demand-side of the fuses. There is no Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for remote operation or monitoring of the electrical system. However, Duquesne Light Company has the capability to remotely read the electric meter at the substation through a modem.  The existing system is primarily underground, with above ground lines in a few areas. The underground cable was installed in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) conduit with concrete casing between 1955 and 1975. Most of the overhead cable is original, installed in the early 1960s.  Underground cables and ducts, and most of the overhead cables are in good condition. Transformers are generally in good condition, and the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated electrical equipment has been replaced. Handholes and power poles are in good condition. Competitive proposals were requested in 2003 and no offers were received. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR><BR>QUESTIONS CAN BE EMAILED TO: contracting@papitt.ang.af.mil

have CDKN2A mutations, suggesting that other CDKN2A-inactivating mechanisms or
additional genes on 9p21 might be responsible for CMM predisposition in these
families. The rest of our families do not carry mutations of the known genes.
Based on data from a natural history study of our melanoma families, mutation
negative families did not differ significantly from families segregating CDKN2A
and CDK4 in clinical and phenotypic characteristics, such as number of primary
melanomas and dysplastic nevi (DN) status. Compared to sporadic melanoma cases,
melanoma cases in our mutation negative families have earlier age-onset and
higher prevalence of multiple melanomas and DN, suggesting the existence of
genetic predisposition. However, since most of these families we have evaluated
only have 2 to 3 living melanoma cases, linkage analysis may lack power in
identifying susceptibility genes particularly under the situation of genetic
heterogeneity. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The objective of this
procurement is to perform CGH on whole-genome arrays to identify copy number
changes that segregate with disease traits in CMM families. Specifically,
genomic DNA from blood samples of 80 subjects from 27 families without known
mutations will be analyzed for arrayCGH to identify disease-related CNVs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The results will be useful to
identify additional genes and novel mechanisms that are associated with CMM
susceptibility in CMM families that do not have known mutations and are too
small for linkage analyses.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Roche NimbleGen offers the
highest resolution array CGH platform on the market for analysis of DNA copy
number. Unique features of Roche NimbleGen arrays include ultra-high density
and long oligonucleotide probes that provide superior performance and data
quality. The tiling-path designs provide comprehensive coverage of both genic
and intergenic regions and are not limited to loci represented by SNP arrays.
These unique features allow ultra-high resolution detection of small deletions
and amplifications as well as breakpoint mapping to gene-level resolution, even
in complex regions such as segmental duplication loci. The enhanced sensitivity
of long oligonucleotide probes enables better signal-to-noise ratios compared
to short probes. Long probes also provide a greater specificity and tolerance
for mismatches to detect copy number changes in polymorphic regions of the
genome. The success and reproducibility of Roche NimbleGen arrays have been
demonstrated through series of publications on major scientific journals such as
Nature Genetics, American Journal of Human Genetics, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, and etc.
Our recent experience with Roche NimbleGen arrays using the same design and
arrays in another familial cancer project was extremely positive. Both
laboratory assays and data analyses were performed with high quality and with
short turnaround time. Their technical support was very helpful. In short, Roche
NimbleGen possesses the unique and superb array platform which specifically
fits our study design. The company provides a full-service package including
both array experiments and bioinformatics data processing, which will free us
from purchasing equipment and software and validating assays. All the work will
be done in a timely manner, which is critical for the success of our ongoing
efforts to identify disease-related CNVs as a novel mechanism. </span></p>

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f! irst article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management, on behalf of the Office of Overseas Buildings Operations, is seeking a qualified A/E firm, joint venture or other such entity, to design the new U.S. Embassy located in London, United Kingdom.  The Embassy building will be in the range of  45,000-50,000 gross square meters in area.  The intended site is located in Nine Elms, Wandsworth, near the Vauxhall Bridge on the river Thames, and is approximately 20,000 square meters in size.  The estimated construction budget is between $450 million and $550 million.  This is a design-bid-build project.  The resultant design contract will be fixed price.  The selection will be made in three steps.  Step One will focus on the qualifications of the design firms, partnerships, corporations, associations, joint ventures, or other legal entities, and the proposed lead designers.  In this step, firms will be judged by a panel that includes American architects with experience in the design of American Embassies and other government buildings.  Those firms having the best applicable design expertise and experience will be invited to propose their entire project design team, which will be evaluated in Step Two.  The design teams selected in Step Two for further consideration will then be invited to participate in Step Three, a design competition, which will serve as the basis for the final selection.  The scope of services under the proposed contract includes architecture and urban design; structural, civil, mechanical, and geotechnical engineering; space planning and systems furniture integration; interior design; security and communications systems design; blast and fire protection engineering; landscape design; cost estimating; scheduling; value engineering; administrative coordination of the various disciplines involved; services during construction; and compliance with U.S. Government requirements and the applicable laws, codes and standards of the Borough of Wandsworth, the Greater London Authority, London, United Kingdom.  The building will be designed and constructed in hard metric (System International) units.  Each design submission, including drawings prepared for the competition, shall include BIM modeling files.  Step Three of the competition, and the subsequent Embassy design, require access to classified information.  Step One.  Firms, partnerships, corporations, associations, joint ventures, or other legal entities, responding to this announcement on or before the closing date will be considered for selection using the evaluation criteria identified below--100 points maximum: (1) Past Performance on Design.  Submit written narrative descriptions, graphics, or photographs, describing not more than five designs completed within the past 10 years, including dates of design completion and construction completion.  A maximum of five 8.5 inch x 11 inch sheets of paper per project, in both hard copy and electronic format.  The projects shall be government, corporate, or institutional facilities, comparable in complexity and scope to the subject project, and located in urban settings.  Firms may meet this requirement, by association with firms that have this experience, provided the firm having 51 percent or greater interest in the joint venture is the one completing the application.  These criteria will be used to evaluate the designs: (a) The appropriateness of each building for the urban environment in which it is located; (b) how well each building satisfies the functional and operational requirements of its users; and (c) the environmental sensitivity and the use of Green design practices for each building's design.  The description for each design should specifically address how the design responds to each of the foregoing criteria.  In addition, the narrative should identify any awards, peer recognition, etc., that the design received-60 points maximum.  (2) Lead Designer Profile and Portfolio.  Include a biographical sketch including education, professional experience, and design awards received.  Identify and describe proposed areas of responsibility and commitment to the subject project.  Submit written narrative descriptions, graphics, or photographs (maximum five 8.5 inch x 11 inch sheets of paper per project) of not more than three recent designs, including dates of design completion and construction completion.  (These may be in addition to the five designs submitted in response to (1) above.)  Also, explain the role, if any, of the proposed lead designer in the projects described in response to (1) above.  The narrative should include a discussion of design challenges and resolutions including how the designs responded to user requirements-30 points maximum.  (3) Philosophy and Design Intent.  State the following (maximum of two typewritten pages), (a) overall design philosophy; (b) methods for identifying, analyzing, integrating, and interpreting design parameters, including user's functional, operational, and technical requirements; (c) philosophy of creating a U.S. Embassy with a focus on any unique considerations because of its location; and (d) professional responsibility as the lead designer-10 points maximum.  Step Two.  In Step Two, the firms short-listed in Step One shall identify, and the Government shall evaluate, their entire project team, their designated lead designer, and all the consultants that will work on the project.  Local consulting team members are encouraged to contribute, where appropriate, on unclassified areas of work.  The design firms short-listed in Step One may form a project team by joining with other short-listed firms or other entities or individuals.  To facilitate their efforts to identify the most highly qualified team members, the short-listed firms will be announced in FedBizOpps.Gov prior to the closing date for Step Two submissions.  A maximum of 12 short-listed firms will be invited to submit a Standard Form 330 for their entire project team and interview as appropriate.  Selection criteria, and the closing date for Step Two submissions, will be provided after the short-list is approved in Step One.  Criteria will include, at a minimum, each project team's professional qualifications, experience and past performance, organization and management, and subcontracting plans.  Step Three.  A design competition, judged by a panel that includes outside professionals, and conducted with the assistance of a competition adviser, will constitute the final step in the selection process.  The teams selected in Step Two for further consideration in Step Three (up to a maximum of six firms) will be notified in writing, and a package of information including project requirements, site information, procedural rules, submission requirements and evaluation criteria will be distributed and used to prepare the submissions for the design competition.  A fixed stipend, in an amount yet to be determined, but intended to defray the costs of the design competition, will be provided to offerors submitting timely proposals that comply with the requirements for Step Three submissions.  In order to be eligible for award of this contract, the successful contractor must possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Secret Facility Clearance (FCL), with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M.  Personnel requiring access to classified information contained in the Step Three design requirements package must possess Secret personnel security clearances. Certain design team subcontractors/consultants may also require FCLs and personnel security clearances for access to classified portions of the Step Three design requirements package.  Contractors already possessing the necessary FCL should submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with their Step One submission.  If a contractor making the Step Three short-list does not possess an Interim or Final Secret FCL, the Department of State will sponsor the uncleared firm for an FCL.  Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance.  Until short-listed firms have been issued the appropriate FCL, and received DSS approval to safeguard classified documents, they will not receive the classified portions of the Step Three project design requirements package.  A period of 90 days from the date of sponsorship will be allowed for an uncleared contractor to obtain the necessary FCL.  The Government will not be obligated to extend its competition schedule, if any short-listed sponsored firm has not been issued a FCL.  Firms which form joint ventures must also comply with the above FCL requirements.  Each entity comprising the joint venture must be issued an FCL, as well as the joint venture.  Foreign firms are not eligible for FCLs.  Only U.S. firms organized and operating in the U.S. or Puerto Rico, or a U.S. possession or trusted territory, are eligible for facility clearances. U.S. firms which are determined to be under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) are not eligible for a FCL unless actions (as directed and approved by DSS) can be taken to effectively negate or reduce associated FOCI risks to an acceptable level.  This process often takes more than the 90 days allotted for this competition.  Information on the clearance process can be found on the DSS website, at http://www.dss.mil, under Industrial Security.  Short-listed contractors may utilize non-U.S. firms as design team subcontractors on unclassified portions of the competition, however, the Department reserves the right to review and reject potential design team subcontractors for security reasons during the Step Two teaming review.  A copy of the Prohibited Countries List, from which contractors may not choose design team members, can be obtained from the Contracting Officer listed in the last paragraph of this announcement.  Firms being considered for award under this acquisition are limited to "United States Person" offerors, as defined in the Act.  The offeror must complete and submit as part of its qualification package the pamphlet, Certifications Relevant to Public Law 99-399, Statement of Qualifications for Purpose of Section 402 of The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986.  (The pamphlet is attached to this announcement and may also be obtained from the Contracting Officer listed at the end of this notice.)  If a joint venture is formed, the company having 51 percent or greater interest in the JV must be the one completing the pamphlet.  This is a pass/fail evaluated area.  Submissions from offerors who do not receive a pass rating will not be further evaluated.  This is not a request for proposals.  Since a contract may result in an award over $500,000, large businesses shall be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan prior to contract award.  The DOS Fiscal Year 2009 subcontracting goals are: small business 49.6%; small disadvantaged business 5.0%; women-owned business 5.0%; HUBZone business 3.0%; and service disabled veteran business 3.0%.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541310, $4.5 million average.     
Selection shall be in accordance with the Brooks Act, P.L. 92-582 (40 U.S.C. 1101-1104).  Design firms that meet the above-listed requirements, are invited to submit one original signature and two photocopies of the documents listed under the Step One evaluation criteria. 
All submissions listed in Step One (including the statement of qualifications of P.L. 99-399, and a description of the proposed legal relationship between A/E entities), must be received by 10:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on December 3, 2008.  Requests for clarification must be submitted, in writing, to Mr. Brian Mulcahy, not later than 2:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on November 19, 2008.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard Research and Development Center (USCG RDC) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to BAE Systems National Security Solutions, Inc. (BAE Systems) to develop and deliver improved software, test and evaluation results, operational performance data and technical documentation for the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology (DHS S&T) Directorate’s Automated Scene Understanding (ASU) concept evaluation software system that has completed development by BAE Systems under the Department of Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) Broad Agency Announcement 04-05 “Automated Scene Understanding – Technical Topic Area 3: Prototyping and Demonstration System: Hawkeye Testbed” (HSARPA Solicitation No. HSSCHQ-04-R-0063) dated April 12, 2004 and subsequently awarded under USCG Contract No. HSCG32-05-C-R00004 on March 21, 2005. The new effort will support the transition of the concept evaluation software system to the USCG for possible use in mitigating technological risk in the future acquisition by the USCG of technologies for use in enhancing port and coastal maritime security. The current ASU concept evaluation software system developed under USCG Contract No. HSCG32-05-C-R00004 ingests vessel track data generated by any port and coastal surveillance system’s radar and AIS receivers, detects, tracks and categorizes vessels (by length) using the surveillance system’s pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras, fuses the video tracks with the radar and AIS tracks, controls and manages multiple PTZ cameras to optimize camera coverage and tracking of many vessels, and calibrates the cameras in order to enhance video track accuracy at maximum ranges under varying atmospheric and lighting conditions. The ASU software also learns normal patterns of vessel behaviors from the composite track picture in varying vessel size categories, and alerts the sensor watchstander on anomalous vessel behaviors as compared to the learned patterns. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements”. The sole source is based upon the contractor’s extensive specialized technical knowledge of and experience with the ASU software system’s design, operation, optimization methodologies and control sensitivities, the system’s tuning methodologies used for integration and operation with the real-time, high-volume sensor data streams, detailed knowledge of the specialized software and algorithms, and proprietary rights to the software to be used during performance of the contract, all of which are critical for the execution of the new effort. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512. To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov/. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement to the above address. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements. See Note 22.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award, based upon the availability of funds, a contract entitled Mid Atlantic Ocean Model Calculations, a study to conduct an accurate numerical modeling hindcast of surface ocean currents in the Mid-Atlantic region.   This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The Minerals Management Service, Procurement Operations Branch is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  The anticipated period of performance will be a maximum of 24 months from the effective date of the contract.  The estimated cost range is between $850,000 and $1,000,000.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541690:  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Service.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement type contract for the effort described herein.  INTRODUCTION:  The Minerals Management Service (MMS) has an ongoing need to perform computer simulations of the trajectories of hypothetical oil spills in U. S. coastal waters.  The simulations are used to estimate the probabilities of oil spill contact to environmental and commercial resources, which in turn are part of the overall environmental impact assessments MMS makes in its offshore oil and gas leasing program.  To construct the simulated trajectories, MMS needs speed and direction of ocean surface currents in geographical areas of interest and a concurrent ocean surface wind field.  This project seeks ocean current and wind fields from the entire Atlantic Ocean, with particular emphasis on the U. S. coastal region offshore to the 200 mile limit.  By comparison with in situ observations, the ocean currents must realistically reproduce the many features of the circulation in the Mid-Atlantic.  This study will provide the MMS an accurate hindcast of the mesoscale and large-scale ocean currents obtained by data assimilation techniques incorporated into a state-of-the-art ocean circulation numerical model capable of fully reproducing ocean currents at spatial scales down to 5-10 km and at the time scale of 3 hours.  Additionally, MMS requires the time sequences of the model inputs used to make the ocean current calculations and the computer language source code of the numerical model with documentation enabling qualified MMS personnel to use the model.  STUDY OBJECTIVES:  (1) To obtain an accurate numerical model hindcast field of ocean surface currents in the Mid-Atlantic region and Atlantic Ocean at the resolution of 5-10 km and 3 hours.  At a minimum, the numerical model inputs shall be the surface wind, river runoff into the Mid-Atlantic, ocean temperature and salinity, surface heat flux, tidal forcing, and data assimilation of satellite altimetry.  The numerical model used shall be a state-of-the-art numerical model, which has been demonstrated through peer-reviewed research to accurately reproduce mesoscale ocean currents.  The resultant field of ocean surface currents must span the 15-year period from January 1, 1994 through December 31, 2008.  (2) To estimate the accuracy of the locations of the Gulf Stream, Gulf Stream eddies, and the secondary eddies in the Mid-Atlantic.  MMS requires a skill assessment of the model-derived horizontal surface currents to demonstrate the accuracy of the surface currents during the 15-year time period.  (3) To obtain the computer language source code of the numerical model used, all the input fields for the 15-year time period, and a users manual enabling a numerical modeler at MMS to operate the model at MMS.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The collection and processing of ancillary data and the numerical computations shall be conducted in the first twelve (12) months.  The remaining period shall be dedicated to verifying the accuracy of the model output currents and the preparation of a final report and a users manual for the numerical model.  (Computational Domain Specification) The computational domain shall be the entire Atlantic Ocean, with particular emphasis on the U. S. coastal region offshore to the 200 mile limit, to minimize the open boundary conditions.  The numerical grid may be variable in mesh size but never greater than 5-10 km in each horizontal direction.  The model must computationally resolve diurnal variability.  Task 1.  Numerical Modeling Hindcast of Surface Ocean Currents.  An accurate hindcast of the surface ocean circulation in the computational domain (defined above) shall be performed using an existing, state-of-the-art, mesoscale-eddy-resolving, numerical ocean circulation model over the 15-year time period of January 1, 1994 through December 31, 2008.  The model input forcing shall consist of at least the surface winds, river runoff into the Atlantic Ocean, ocean temperature and salinity, surface heat flux, and data assimilation of satellite altimetry using a procedure accepted by the oceanographic modeling community.  Other forcing phenomena such as the tide generating forces or atmospheric pressure will be used.   Sea surface temperature derived from satellite observations may be used optionally in the data assimilation scheme of the numerical model.  Task 2. Verification of Model Hindcast Accuracy.  The accuracy of the time-varying locations and strengths of the modeled Gulf Stream. Gulf Stream eddies and other, secondary eddies in the Mid-Atlantic shall be determined by comparing the models output field of surface currents against available observations during the same period of time.  Sea surface temperature derived from satellite observations shall also be used for the model/data comparison. Additionally, an extensive set of locations of satellite-tracked, surface ocean drifters deployed on the U. S. continental shelf in the Mid-Atlantic are available and may be used for verification of model hindcast accuracy.Task 3. Technical Report and Users Manual Preparation.  A technical report documenting the models input fields, the models physics and numerical methods employed, and the observations, methods, and results of the accuracy verification of the output currents shall be produced.  In addition, a users manual documenting the computer language source code of the numerical model used and its operation shall be produced.  The users manual shall also document the other, ancillary computer programs provided and shall be written for a sophisticated user  one who is knowledgeable about numerical ocean circulation modeling in general but not necessarily familiar with the particular model used in this study.  DELIVERABLES:  In addition to progress and final reports and formal presentations to MMS and advisors, the contractor shall provide to MMS the model input and output fields in a format mutually agreed upon, the computer programming language source code of the numerical model and ancillary programs, and a users manual to enable a sophisticated numerical modeler to prepare the computational grid and model inputs and operate the numerical model.  MMS may additionally request that the input and output fields be geo-referenced in a format accessible to the ARCVIEW computer program.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command Conventional Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA-201) has conducted a Market Survey of Industry to determine potential interested sources who have the skills, experience, qualifications and knowledge required to successfully develop and provide the next generation FMU-139 Electronic Bomb Fuze, which will be identified as a FMU-164/B Bomb Fuze.  

The next generation FMU-164/B Bomb Fuze shall meet a higher reliability requirement than current legacy bomb fuzes, provide in-cockpit re-programmability, via an integral Serial Data Interface (SDI), with multiple arming and multiple function delay selections, and provide a moderate hard target penetration capability.  The FMU-164/B Bomb Fuze contains a non-interrupted (in-line) explosive train.  Once a valid launch has occurred, the FMU-164/B Bomb Fuze will arm and function as programmed by the SDI.  If the SDI is not used, the FMU-164/B Bomb Fuze provides arm times and function delay times selected either by the pulsed power/Fuze Function Control Set (FFCS), or with continuous (turbine) power, by ground selection using the faceplate arm/delay switch.  The FMU-164/B Bomb Fuze can be initiated by either an external proximity sensor or internal impact sensor.  A closure ring secures the FMU-164/B Bomb Fuze in the three-inch diameter fuze well of the warhead.  Prior to operational use the FMU-164/B Bomb Fuze may be stored, transported worldwide, installed in a weapon, loaded on an aircraft, and flown during captive carriage without release.  The FMU-164/B Bomb Fuze is to be compatible with all tail fuzed, General Purpose (GP) weapons and their guided variants authorized to use an FMU-139, and the BLU-109 Warhead and its guided variants.  

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Precision Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA-201) announces its intention to hold an Industry Day for the FMU-164/B Bomb Fuze.  

The Government plans to hold the Industry Day at Wyle Laboratories Inc. Conference Center, 22300 Exploration Drive, Lexington Park, MD 20653-2013 on 4 December 2008.

	- Groundwater Treatment Plants (GWTP)	- Various types of soil caps and RCRA landfill caps	- Air sparging, soil vapor extraction, bioslurper and free product recovery systems	- Wastewater treatment facilities	- Bioremediation systems	- Natural Attenuation
*  Monitoring of groundwater wells*  Disposal and Storage of investigative derived waste*  Sampling and analysis of various media including water, soil, sediment, air and vapor*  Construction of environmental removal actions/remedies; as well as field modifications to treatment facilities, storage systems and spill containment/control processes*  Documenting and reporting findings*  Other related activities associated with restoring areas to safe and acceptable condition*  Treatment systems can include tanks, POL pipelines, storm water drains, oil water separators, pumps and manholes.  The contractor will be able to provide inspections, cleaning, maintenance and repair per API and State regulations.*  Hazardous materials/hazardous waste/ Toxic substances management, sampling, analysis, and reporting
In addition to performance of the specific services listed above, the contractor will generally be responsible for maintaining records and preparation of written documents such as Operations and Maintenance (O&M) plan modifications, work plans, health & safety plans, sampling and analysis plans (SAP), and waste management plans connected with such services.  The contractor may also be required to provide proposed solutions to technical problems and optimization.  The work also includes performing indefinite quantity work such as maintenance, repair, and /or construction directed by the Contracting Officer via issued Task Orders.
Proposed Contract Task Order (CTO) ordering procedures:  
Each CTO will be initially awarded on a "fair opportunity" basis as outlined in FAR 16.505.  Because the initial contracts will be awarded through a rigorous Best Value Source Selection (BVSS) process, we intend to make maximum use of the latitude allowed by the FAR to streamline CTO awards.  Typically, only price and past performance will be considered.  When required, we will maintain the ability to employ more rigorous evaluation criteria for CTO awards.
Follow-on CTO's will be ordered as an "exception to the fair opportunity process" as outlined in FAR 16.505.  Because O&M/Long Term Monitoring (LTM) requires consistent management, it would be impractical to re-compete each CTO at its completion.  Each awardee will have a fair opportunity to be considered for the original orders, but, we will attempt to negotiate subsequent follow-on CTO's on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency.  If we are unable to negotiate a fair and reasonable price, we will reserve the right to compete the follow-on work on a "fair opportunity" basis to all contract awardees.
The range for each contract is $20,000,000 to $30,000,000.
All Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUBZone Small Business, and certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to respond.  The Government will not pay for any information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. One of the main functions of this synopsis is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining whether an 8(a), HUBZone Small Business or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-aside is an acceptable strategy for this procurement.   If a full and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals.  All qualified firms are encouraged to respond. The Government anticipates a contract award for these contracts in March 2009.  The appropriate NAICS Code is 562910 with a size standard of 500 employees.
It is requested that interested parties submit a brief capabilities package not to exceed 5 pages.  This capabilities package shall address, at a minimum the following:
(1)  Examples of projects worked within the last five years of similar size, scope and complexity as the work indicated.  Knowledge of the state regulations within the AOR.  Indicate whether your firm worked as a prime or subcontractor, contract value, brief description of how the referenced contract relates to the work described, and a Government / Agency point of contact.
(2)  Company profile, to include number of offices and number of employees per office, annual receipts, office location(s), available bonding capacity in excess of $16,000,000 per contract, DUNS number, and CAGE Code.
(3)  Please indicate if you are a 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Woman Owned, and Veteran Owned.
(4)  In order to assist us in determining the geographic boundaries of the contract(s) necessary to cover the RAO requirement within our AOR, please identify the geographic area in which you can operate in an efficient and economical manner.
The capabilities package for this sources sought notice is not expected to be a proposal, but rather a short statement regarding the company's ability to demonstrate existing, or developed, expertise and experience in relation to this contract.  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the capabilities package.   Submission of a capabilities package is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Navy in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.

<DESC>The Department of Navy (DoN) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP)  in early 2009 for renewable energy generation opportunities at Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake, California; Naval Air Station (NAS) Fallon, Nevada;  Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) Twentynine Palms, California, and Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, Arizona.  The DoN will consider opportunities for the purchase of renewable power, developer wholesale generation, distributed generation, and the combination of those opportunities. Specifically, the Navy will provide Government land on these installations for large scale multi-megawatt renewable energy generation system, or systems, to be developed, constructed, owned, operated and maintained by a private entity.
In order for the DoN to develop a succinct RFP, we seek to identify responsible sources and obtain information, in regards, to the opportunities and risks associated with these specific installations, and sites identified on the installations.

Specifically, the DoN objectives are:
-Maximize the land opportunity for the development of a renewable generation asset on the specific installation.
-Provide energy security for the installation.
-Maximize the financial benefit of the opportunity.
-Purchase power at a lower cost than current cost, as applicable.
In order to meet these objectives, the DoN will consider the following opportunities:
-Wholesale generation to the utility grid, with revenue sharing considerations.
-Medium to long term arrangements for the purchase of power.
-Distributed generation, including net metering or feed-in tariff arrangements.
-A combination of the above. 

Documents are made available that provide characteristics of each site at the selected installations.  More detailed information will be made available as the RFP process proceeds.
In order to maximize cost competitiveness, responders should identify risks and opportunities associated with each installation and each site.   

The specific information the DoN seeks at this time to formulate a succinct RFP are:
(1) Name and brief description of company(2) Capability and pertinent experience (3) Financial capacity to develop and construct a renewable generation asset(4) The renewable resource and technology that maximizes the opportunity at each installation and site(5) The size and capacity of the generation asset that maximizes the land opportunity at each site, and describe what type of arrangement maximizes that opportunity, i.e. wholesale generation, power purchase agreement, distributed generation or a combination.  If a combination, describe size and capacity of each.  Provide discussion on how each opportunity was considered with respect to the following:(a) Risks and opportunities of transmission access and capacity for each installation and site, and load and consumption data.(b) Incentives (ITC, PTC, CSI, SGIP, etc.)(c) Other costs (Standby charges, departing load, application fees, etc.)(d) Utility Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) process and Market Price Referent (MPR), or other utility processes and market benchmarks, as applicable(e) Sales of Renewable Energy Credits (REC's) or Portfolio Credits (PC's) if applicable(f) Land opportunity, e.g. cost of lease for similar BLM land or privately owned land(g) Other risks and opportunities(6) Indicate which installations present the best opportunity for development by your company, and brief discussion why.  Indicate if there are economies of scale in pursuing more than one installation, and what if any contractual arrangements would be beneficial.(7) Indicate what additional information would be helpful in determining the opportunities and risks, e.g. site survey, environmental studies, NEPA documentation, technical/load information.(8) Indicate your desire for a site visit to the installations, and purpose.(9) Any innovative and/or new conceptual ideas and recommendations for alternatives for the sale of power and/or arrangement for the taking of power.  
All information submitted will be considered proprietary and confidential.  It is not mandatory to submit a response to this RFI to participate in a formal request for proposals process that will take place in the future.  However, it should be noted that information gathered through this RFI may significantly influence how the DoN proceeds in such a process.  The desired goal for the DoN for this RFI is to solicit maximum industry participation, which will allow the DoN to formulate a concise acquisition process, and in a timely manner.  This request for information shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the requested information.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request.  This request for information is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.<BR><BR>1. BACKGROUND:  The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to equip operational commanders with Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and Government off the Shelf (GOTS) solutions in order to increase effectiveness and reduce risk. The REF receives requirements from operational commanders setting forth necessary capabilities. The REF is chartered by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>2. SCOPE:  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain potential solutions/ systems that will enable soldiers using the M-14 rifle to engage targets from 800 to 1000 meters range. The potential solution/system should consist of a daylight scope, scope rings mountable to a mil-std-1913 rail, and mil-std-1913 rail system that can easily mount to the M-14. The M-14 rifle does not come with a rail system, so any potential scope must include a mount that will attach the scope securely to the M-14.  Additionally, the rail system must be long enough to mount the daylight scope and an AN/PVS-22, AN/PVS-26 or AN/PVS-27 simultaneously and in line.<BR><BR>3. REQUIREMENTS:  The REF is looking for a complete system of day scope, scope rings and mounting rail which can be easily emplaced on the M-14 rifle by an Army unit level armorer. <BR><BR>3.1. The day scope in a kit shall provide the capability to engage targets at 800-1000 meters. <BR>3.2. The reticule pattern should be stadia metric and allow for rapid range estimation by the use of stadia subtended over the width of a mans shoulders.<BR>3.3. The day scope in a kit should allow for a minimum of 2.5-10 variable power adjustment.<BR>3.4. The day scope in a kit shall have a 40 millimeter objective lens and a 30mm or 1 inch tube.<BR>3.5. The day scope in a kit shall have an illuminated reticule either by powered LED or ambient light collection.<BR>3.6. Each kit shall come with 2 scope rings that fit the body of the scope and quickly attach to a mil-std-1913 rail.<BR>3.7. Each kit will come with a mil-std-1913 rail that can easily be fixed to a standard M-14 and provides enough mounting space to concurrently mount the day scope and an AN/PVS-22, AN/PVS-26 or AN/PVS-27 simultaneously and in line.<BR><BR>Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to Army Product Manager REF who will evaluate the information and feasibility of issuing a procurement action to resolve the stated problem.<BR><BR><BR>This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit a white paper which supports the companys claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to satisfy the performance and technical objectives described above.  The white paper should discuss the companys ability to develop and or provide existing technologies which meet the above requirements and should provide a ROM (rough order of magnitude) price and its anticipated delivery for the solution proposed.<BR><BR>The white paper should also discuss related company experience and include point(s) of contact.

<RESPDATE>111808
<ARCHDATE>12032008
<CONTACT>Mr. Dwight B. Micheal, Sr.Contracting OfficerMarine Corps Systems CommandPhone:  703.432.3267

<a href="mailto:dwight.micheal@usmc.mil">Contracting Officer's email address</a>
<DESC>The Marine Corps System Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to identify potential vendors and to acquire enhanced knowledge and understanding of industry's capabilities regarding Sense and Respond Logistics (S&RL) capabilities for possible use in support of Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) logistics efforts.  MAGTF logisticians must have adaptive and responsive demand and support networks to effectively execute logistics support operations in a future Net-centric environment.  S&RL capabilities include predicting what will be needed, where it will be needed and in what quantities it will be needed, and automatically responding to both anticipated and unanticipated requirements.  The envisioned S&RL capability will produce full end-to-end solutions by providing integrated situational awareness (SA) and responsive execution processes based on real time (or near real time) visibility across all areas of required logistics support (i.e., mainte! nance, supply, engineering, health, transportation, services).
The requested information will be used by the United States Marine Corps to accomplish the Functional Solutions Analysis portion of a Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) of MAGTF S&RL, which supports the development of an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for MAGTF S&RL.  The CBA has established the capabilities required to effectively implement S&RL, identified gaps in the Marine Corps' ability to achieve those capabilities and is now exploring solutions capable of addressing those gaps.  
The CBA analysis effort has used a MAGTF Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) employment scenario to replicate a full range of logistics planning, execution, adaptation and fulfillment requirements across an S&RL environment.   In this scenario a MEB and its three subordinate battalion size elements move from the sea-base to an in-land combat engagement operation.   MACORSYSCOM is seeking market research information (in White Paper format) from technology or service providers who can demonstrate an ability to produce comprehensive end-to-end solutions covering the six basic functions of MAGTF S&RL which are: (1) Acquiring data (about health, readiness, support and sustainment requirements, and the support network, etc.); (2) Assessing the situation (turning that data into information); (3) Developing forecasts (for support and sustainment needs based on the information); (4) Conducting collaborative planning (using the information to develop courses of support and courses of a! ction); (5) Initiating response (automatically generating responses to support and sustainment needs and/or adapting the support network) and (6) Sharing information (the ability to securely and automatically relevant information to and from units, networks, databases, operations centers, etc.)
These capabilities must provide the ability to predict and respond to both anticipated and unanticipated needs in order to maintain MAGTF combat effectiveness.  S&RL builds upon the theory of Net-Centric Warfare and Joint Adaptive Expeditionary Warfare practices.  It accommodates the critical elements of high rates of change, closely coupled events, speed of command, and self-synchronization.  S&RL solutions should align to the established tenets of S&RL which are: (1) Demand can be unpredictable, so success depends on speed of pattern recognition and speed of response; (2) The best supply chain is no longer one that is highly optimized, but one that is highly flexible; (3) Units and subunits should be organized into "modular capabilities" that negotiate with one another over commitments; (4) Networks "self-synchronize" via a common environment and set of shared objectives and (5) Use Information Technology (IT) for data sharing, "knowing earlier", commitment tracking and ro! le reconfiguration.
Individual or teams of commercial or government providers of solutions that can accomplish the MAGTF S&RL functions noted above should provide a White Paper summary (not to exceed 5 pages counting cover page) of their proposed end to end solution.  MARCORSYSCOM will review all submissions and contact providers for additional details as needed.  
Interested parties should submit a written response, on corporate letter head, to the following address: COMMANDING GENERAL, MARCORSYSCOM, Contracts - PG-16 (CT 023), Attn: Dwight B. Micheal, Sr., 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, Virginia 22134-6050, no later than 18 November 2008. Electronic responses in the format cited above are acceptable.  Electronic responses should be submitted to:  dwight.micheal@usmc.mil.  Submitted information will not be returned.  This is not a request for proposal or quotation.  No solicitation document exists.  This is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure these items, nor does the Marine Corps intend to award on the basis of the sources sought/market research or otherwise pay for the information requested.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI.

1.  Materials that can meet the specific requirements of existing specifications as listed in MIL-C-83429B dated September 26, 1990 or MIL-C-81814C dated 17 Aug 1990.

2.  Materials that may not completely adhere to the characteristics listed within a particular cloth specification will also be evaluated as potential alternatives and will be considered.  Your submission should call out the area(s) in which your material differs from the specification requirements.

Submissions should include the following:

1) Description of your product (what is it, essential characteristics)
2) Test reports detailing your material’s performance.
3) Production rate/capacity information
4) General costing/pricing of your material.
5) Samples for testing (see below under Submission format).
    
Submissions received will be reviewed by DSCP Technical personnel and may be forwarded to the Services for further review if warranted.  You will be required to affirm in writing that your response may be provided to the Services for their review.

Only domestically manufactured materials will be considered as part of this announcement.

Additional discussions may be conducted with respondents about their submissions if required.

<p>Pursuant to the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Subparts 6.302-1(a)1 and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(c), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competitive procedures is justified for this procurement action. The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2 (Content).</p>
<p>1. Contracting Agency - United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Central Office, Administration Division, Acquisitions Branch, National Acquisitions Section.</p>

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for scientific research that will forge major advancements in the state of scientific knowledge of computational foundations for representing data and information from diverse, disparate sources and across application areas.  Our long-term, ultimate goal is to develop computing capabilities that automate the decision-making process in the network information environment to support naval operations.  Such decision-making process encompasses sensing; data mining and analysis; information extraction and understanding; object, activity, and intent recognition; and course of action determination.  Quintessential to automating the decision process is how to mathematically and computationally represent data, information, and knowledge and to use it algorithmically to analyze, understand, and reason under uncertainty.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6, “Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items,” as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations/proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.

Solicitation number 09Y039374 is a request for quotations (RFQ), The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27.

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 518210, with a small business size standard of $25M. 

The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Lorton Data, Inc., 2125 E. Hennepin Ave., Suite 200. Minneapolis, MN 55413.  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS REQUIREMENT BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:  Sole source is justified based on the need for Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) to meet Social Security Administration’s (SSA) data exchange requirements for communication within the SSA environment. The FPLS must work within the SSA NCC environment to process any NCOALink® requests it will receive from states and exchange with an outside vendor.  This environment constrains the FPLS to use only the SSA configured data exchange protocol, Connect: Direct®, a Sterling Commerce product.  SSA recently competed its acquisition (February 2008) of a licensed NCOALink® vendor.  Lorton Data won that competition.  SSA has established electronic communications with Lorton Data, and has established Connect:Direct® with Secure Plus as the mandatory protocol for data exchanges.  This product is used because of its high level data exchange security.  Any vendor OCSE might chose would also be required to use that mandatory protocol as well.  Lorton Data is conducting NCOALink® exchanges for SSA, and; therefore, already meets SSA’s data exchange requirements.  Additionally, Lorton Data also meets SSA requirements regarding important OCSE considerations: security, protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and background investigations of employees.
 Rate savings should be gained by eliminating redundancies and by capitalizing on SSA’s implementation of an NCOALink® exchange with Lorton Data.  This would be especially important since the FPLS will have to duplicate the exchange methodology with Lorton Data that SSA has already setup with them.  
Additionally, SSA is considering changing its exchange protocol.  The SSA contract requires the vendor to adopt any changes it may make.  This would be very important to OCSE if a different vendor were procured.  
It is neither practical nor economic for OCSE to attempt to integrate additional communication lines within SSA or to require a potential additional vendor to supply expensive file exchange software for this purpose when the process has already been established by SSA.  
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The period of performance shall be for a basic period of 3 months and 4 one year option period to coincide with the SSA’s contract. 

Basic Period: 11/7/2008 – 02/06/2009
Option Period One: 02/07/2009 – 02/06/2010
Option Period Two: 02/07/2010 – 02/06/2011  
Option Period Three: 02/07/2011 – 02/06/2012  
Option Period Four: 02/07/2012 – 02/06/2013 

The Government may exercise options to extend the period of performance in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, upon written notification by the Contracting Officer within 30 days of contract expiration or within 30 days of funds becoming available for that fiscal year.  

STATEMENT OF WORK

A.	 National Change of Address (NCOA) Processing -  NCOALink®

Over 40 million Americans change their address annually, which creates formidable obstacles in maintaining a high-quality mailing list. The NCOALink® product makes change-of-address information available to mailers to help reduce undeliverable mailpieces before mail enters the mailstream.
 The NCOALink® process consists of computer software purchased, leased or developed by the licensee to access the NCOALink® data. The United States Postal Service (USPS) certifies the process and licenses the NCOALink® product to private sector companies for commercial mail list processing or internal mail list management. Updated, computerized change-of-address information is provided on a regular basis to the NCOALink® licensees by the Postal Service. The NCOALink® process improves mail deliverability by providing mailers with current, standardized, delivery point coded addresses for individual, family, and business moves.  
The Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) maintains the Federal Case Registry (FCR), which is a national database of child support cases.  States transmit case information to the FCR on a daily basis, and receive data back. The FCR is housed at the Social Security Administration (SSA) National Computer Center (NCC). 

OCSE is pursuing a system enhancement that will provide change of address information to State Child Support Agencies who must send a large volume of mail to case participants.  A significant amount of the mail generated by child support agencies is returned and or forwarded.  Using the NCOALink® to keep up-to-date information on case participants will significantly reduce the cost of postage.  A few state child support agencies have already entered into arrangements or are pursuing arrangements with the USPS or its licensed NCOALink® vendors to provide postmaster verifications or change of address information.  

The FPLS has authority under the law to obtain for child support agencies information pertaining to child support matters from federal data bases.  The NCOA being a federal data base offers the FPLS the opportunity to consolidate state efforts and to obtain NCOA information cost effectively and efficiently through a single interface with to the NCOALink® database.  

To provide this service, the USPS licenses this function to qualifying vendors.  The 
FPLS does not have control over the processing environment in which it operates, that is necessary to effectively interface with the USPS and qualify as an NCOALink® processor; therefore, it is the intent of the FPLS not to qualify itself with the USPS for this purpose, but to employ the services of a licensed NCOALink® database vendor as SSA currently does.  

The FCR does not maintain address information on participants. Therefore, states will send name and address information through FCR as needed for the express purpose of checking the address against the NCOALink®.  This makes the states the list owners.  The state requests would be collected and batched and sent to the NCOALink® vendor on a weekly basis.  Responses from the vendor would be sent to the FPLS and forwarded back to the States weekly. States would review any change of address information, and decide for themselves whether to update their records with the changed address information. By providing this service, States would have the opportunity to reduce postal costs and expedite mail delivery.
NCOALink® "processing" standardizes the addresses provided by a State Child Support Enforcement Agency (CSEA) to the FCR and presents the names and standardized addresses to the NCOA database.  The USPS NCOA data base contains information on permanent address changes submitted to USPS by individuals, families and businesses within the last three (3) years.  During NCOALink® processing, new address information will be forwarded to FCR who will then distribute to the appropriate state CSEA when there is an exact match between the name and current address on state records with the name and old address on the NCOA data base. 
All NCOA processing will be subject to the guidelines contained in USPS Publication 28, Postal Addressing Standards; USPS, Office of Address Information Systems, NCOALink® Licensee Performance Requirements; and the USPS NCOALink® Licensee Agreement with the vendor.  

B.  Locatable Address Conversion System (LACS)  (At the option of OCSE).

LACS processing involves correcting address lists electronically for areas that have undergone permanent address conversions.  The LACS database consists of address conversions that USPS has been able to obtain and verify.  These conversions are rural route addresses which are being converted to street addresses, a process which began to enable emergency vehicles to locate the address more quickly when summoned. For this reason, the process is also referred to as "911 conversions." The record format that is attached for NCOA processing will also be used for LACS.
C.  Specifications

Lorton Data shall submit written proof that they are currently authorized by USPS as an NCOALink® licensee.  Immediately inform the FPLS if at any time during the term of the contract they:  (1) are no longer authorized by USPS as an NCOALink® licensee or (2) have received notification that USPS will be canceling or suspending their NCOA authorization for any reason.  Cancellation or suspension of the vendor's NCOALink® license by USPS will result in cancellation of the contract with the FPLS.

Lorton Data shall submit with monthly invoices a summary of activity for each weekly period.  This summary will include counts all records from which charges are calculated.  All other charges will be detailed within the invoice.

Lorton Data may only use personnel on this project that have passed background checks as part of their contract with SSA.  See section E. of this document.  

Lorton Data must handle PII as outlined in section E. of this document.

Lorton Data should take no action on FPLS requests that would jeopardize processing of SSA MBR files.   

The FCR will begin submitting names and addresses for NCOALink® processing beginning in November, 2008.  Table I below represents the expected volumes over the period from November, 2008 to February 2013.  The estimates are imprecise given that state Child Support offices will need to gear-up to utilize this service.  Successful outcomes will encourage their participation.  Usage will continue to grow over the several years planned for this project.

E.  Contractor Responsibilities Regarding Personally Identifiable Information

1.  Definitions  

The following terms are defined for the purposes of this clause:

"Agency" means the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE).

"Employee(s)" means an employee(s) of either the contractor or subcontractor, as used in context that is working under this contract.

"Handling PII" means having access, either currently or in the future, to personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in this clause.  

"Personally Identifiable Information" (PII):  OCSE follows the definition of PII provided by the Office of Management and Budget in OMB Memorandum M-06-19:  "Personally Identifiable Information means any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, biometric records, etc., including any other personal information which is linked or linkable to an individual."

Other examples of PII may include: Social Security benefit data, date of birth, official State or government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number, home address, and medical information.  Within this clause, "PII" shall specifically mean PII as defined above that:  (1) the Government has a primary responsibility for protecting under this contract and (2) is made available to the contractor and/or any subcontractor, including their respective employees, in order to perform under this contract (e.g., under the contract, the Government directly furnishes PII to the contractor). 

"Secure Area" means a place or environment deemed by the Agency as secure for protecting PII.  An example of a secure area is a secure duty station.

2.  Contractor Employee Responsibility in Safeguarding PII 

The contractor shall inform its employees handling PII of their individual responsibility to safeguard it.  In addition, the contractor shall, within reason, take appropriate and necessary action to:  (1) educate employees on the proper procedures designed to protect PII, as described below and as otherwise approved by the Agency; and (2) enforce their compliance with the policy and procedures prescribed as follows:  

(a)  General.  Employees shall properly safeguard PII from loss, theft, or inadvertent disclosure.  Employees are responsible for safeguarding this information at all times, regardless of whether or not the employee is at his or her regular duty station.   Examples of proper safeguarding include, but are not limited to:  not sharing one's password with others or writing it down, verifying the identity of individuals before disclosing information to them, preventing others in the area from viewing PII on one's computer screen, consistently locking or logging off one's workstation when one is away, and ensuring that PII is appropriately returned or, upon Government permission, destroyed when no longer needed.  

(b) Transporting Agency PII outside a Secure Area is prohibited.

(c) The contractor will sign a “Confidentiality Agreement” with OCSE.  This agreement details how agency data will be kept confidential.  

3.  Agency Procedures for All Contractor Employees for Reporting the Loss or Suspected Loss of PII  

The purpose of the process described below is to ensure that the Government's reporting requirements for lost or possibly lost PII are met and that incident information is shared appropriately.   Therefore, along with its own internal procedures, the contractor shall educate its employees handling PII of the following Agency-prescribed procedures.  The contractor shall otherwise, within reason, take appropriate and necessary action to enforce employees' compliance with these procedures.

(a)  When an employee becomes aware of an actual or suspected loss of PII under his/her possession, he/she shall provide immediate notification of the incident to the primary Government manager he/she works with in connection to the contract (for example, the Government project officer or Government task manager).  Examples of incidences indicating actual or suspected loss of PII include missing equipment (including laptops, and removable storage devices such as USB flash or "thumb" drives, CDs, DVDs, etc.) and/or paper documents potentially containing PII, and knowledge that the employee sent PII via email. 

(b)  If the primary Government manager is not readily available, the employee shall immediately notify, depending upon availability, one of two Government alternates designated by the primary Government manager for reporting such incidents.  Prior to commencing work on the contract, the contractor shall furnish each of its employees with the name and contact information of the primary and alternate Government contacts.  

(c)  The employee shall provide updates as they become available to the primary Government manager or the alternate, as applicable, but shall not delay the initial report.  
(d)  The employee shall provide complete and accurate information about the details of the possible PII loss to assist the Government manager/alternate.   The contractor employee shall include the following information:

i. Contact information.

ii. A description of the loss or suspected loss (i.e., nature of loss, scope, number of files or records, type of equipment or media, etc.) including the approximate time and location.  
iii. What safeguards were used, where applicable (e.g., locked briefcase, redacted personal information, password protected, encrypted, etc.).
iv. Which OCSE components have been involved or affected.  
v. Whether any external organizations (i.e., other agencies, law enforcement, press, etc.) have been contacted or contacted the contractor employee.
vi. Whether any other reports have been filed (i.e., Federal Protective Service, local poice, and OCSE reports).
vii. Any other pertinent information. 
 
(e)  Once the employee has notified the primary Government manager or his/her alternate, that manager or alternate will assume responsibility for making the formal report in accordance with Agency procedures.  

 (f)  There may be rare instances outside of business hours when the employee is unable to reach either the primary Government manager.  In such a situation, the contractor employee shall call OCSE's first point of contact for systems or connectivity problems - Abe Klugman at 410-965-5635 or Dominic Perry at 410-966-4737 or Sue Young at 202-260-5981.

(g)  The employee shall limit disclosure of the information and details about an incident to only those with a need to know. 

4.  Applicability of this Clause to Subcontractors/Subcontractor Employees  

(a)  The contractor shall include this clause in all resulting subcontracts whenever there is any indication that the subcontractor, engaged by the contractor, and their employees or successor subcontractor(s) and their employees will or might have access to PII.

(b)  The contractor shall, within reason, take appropriate and necessary action to assure that its subcontractor(s) and their employees or any successor subcontractor(s) and their employees with access to PII know the rules of conduct in protecting and reporting the loss or suspected loss of PII as prescribed in this clause.  

(c)  Notification of Subcontractor Handling of PII.  If the contractor engages a subcontractor under this contract whose employee(s) will be given or have access to PII, the contractor shall do the following: 
i. Notify in advance both the Government project officer and the Contracting Officer of this arrangement, providing the subcontractor name(s) and address(es) and, upon request, a description of the nature of the PII to which the employee(s) will be given/have access (e.g., phone numbers, Social Security numbers); and  

ii. Provide the Government project officer the names of the subcontractor employee(s) who will be assigned and/or have access to the PII.  The contractor may satisfy this requirement when submitting the name(s) of the subcontractor employee(s) to the Government project officer for the requisite security background check described in Item number 5 below.  

5.  Contractor/Subcontractor Background Checks - Security Requirements Clause    

For each contractor and subcontractor employee handling PII, the contractor shall fulfill the requirements of the Security Requirements Clause to ensure that any such individual has the appropriate background checks.  The contractor personnel working on this contract must have completed the background investigation as related to their work on their contract with SSA. SSA will provide the contractor with a written determination of suitability.  A copy of the suitability determination shall be forwarded to the OCSE project officer.  

6.  The contractor as a certified licensee of the USPS must comply postal regulations   regarding the handling of addresses being matched through the NCOALink.  The licensee must enter into an agreement with the USPS that spells out the requirements of a licensee.   The following sections are relevant to our requirements:

Vendor must provide documentation your products are available sterile and/or non-sterile (re-usable); if sterile, have expiration dates on the packaging and the contents of the package can be delivered to a sterile field.<BR>14.	Vendor must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Postal Service (USPS) with a copy of the customs form, PS form 2976-A, sent to the TRBO showing the stamped date the package was shipped to the TRBO eliminating delays that occur with Europes Custom Offices.  Provide acknowledgement of this issue in response to this RFQ. <BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR><BR>Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. <BR><BR>Clinical Evaluation Process<BR><BR>1.	For those companies that meet the requirements above, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). To avoid shipping delays caused by Europes Customs Offices vendors are required to ship samples to the TRBO via USPS to the following APO address:<BR>		Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>		Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>		Mr. Rob Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>		CMR 442<BR>		APO AE 09042<BR>2.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship samples for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of samples by COB on the 14th calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply samples will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send TRBO Point of Contact (POC) verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and the anticipated delivery date via e-mail digitally signed.  Verification of shipment is defined as sending the TRBO a copy of the USPS PS form 2976-A customs form.  The PS form 2976-A will have a stamped date the package was accepted by USPS.  Vendors whose packages have a stamped date after the established notification to ship deadline date will be disqualified from this standardization process. <BR><BR>The samples to be provided will include 5 of each (size as stated with each product line below) per MTF (6 MTFs) to be provided as follows:<BR>1)	Stylet Pediatric Satin or Plastic coated  Size 6fr<BR>2)	Stylet Adult Satin or Plastic coated  Size 14fr<BR>Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR>3.  To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a clinical setting<BR>4.  The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for forty-two 42 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are:  one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.00 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<BR><BR>1.	Clinician preference - The product is malleable.<BR>2.	Patient safety - Color of stylet improves visualization.<BR>3.	Clinician preference  The stylets synthetic coated sheath covering is functional.<BR>4.	Safety in urgent care setting - Packaging identifies the size and style of the endotracheal tube stylet.<BR>			<BR>Pricing Analysis Process:<BR><BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  <BR><BR>2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the CPT.  The CPT will then make a recommendation to the TPRB with the selected vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Region. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<BR><BR>3.	The Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more clinically equal, price will become more important.<BR><BR>4.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  <BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered 	more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; i.e., do the unmatched lines make it difficult to 	compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare 	similar product lines for each vendor?<BR>c.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. <BR><BR>Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:<BR><BR>1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to the FBO  posted RFQ.  The vendors initial responses must include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed in the FBO RFQ.  <BR>2.

The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  <BR>3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. <BR>a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: <BR>(1) Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; <BR> (2) The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>b.    The vendors who meet the following technical /company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an e-mail communication with each vendor. All communication of significant acquisition milestones must be digitally signed.<BR><BR>Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.<BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a response to the twelve (12) Technical/Company criteria below with the vendors initial submittal by the response date of the FBO announcement.<BR><BR>1.

Provide acknowledgement of this issue in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR><BR>Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. <BR><BR>Clinical Evaluation Process<BR><BR>1.	For those companies that meet the requirements above, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select MTFs. To avoid shipping delays caused by Europes Customs Offices vendors are required to ship samples to the TRBO via USPS to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>2.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship samples for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of samples by COB on the 14th calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply samples will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send TRBO Point of Contact (POC) verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and the anticipated delivery date via e-mail digitally signed.  Verification of shipment is defined as sending the TRBO a copy of the USPS PS form 2976-A customs form.  The PS form 2976-A will have a stamped date the package was accepted by USPS.  Vendors whose packages have a stamped date after the established notification to ship deadline date will be disqualified from this standardization process.  <BR><BR>The samples to be provided will include 5 of each (size as stated with each product line below) per MTF (6 MTFs) to be provided as follows:<BR>1.	Endotracheal Tubes Nasal Cuffed Size 7 or 8mm<BR>2.	Endotracheal Tubes Oral Cuffed Size 4 or 4.5mm<BR>3.	Endotracheal Tubes Nasal/Oral Cuffed Size 7 or 8mm<BR>4.

Endotracheal Tubes Oral Cuffed Reinforced - Size 7 or 8mm<BR>8.	Endotracheal Tubes  Flexible-tip - Sizes 4 or 4.5mm and 7 or 8mm<BR>Samples are to be shipped to the Europe Region TRBO.  NOTE:  The USPS TRBO address is written in item #1 above.  The TRBO requests sample orders be separated by MTF.  The TRBO will have the responsibility of forwarding the samples to the participating MTFs. Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR><BR>3.  To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a clinical (patient) setting.<BR><BR>4. The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for forty-two (42) calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are:  one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.00 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<BR><BR>1.	Patient Safety - The product is durable.<BR>2.	Patient Safety - The product has an opening/channel that allows a smooth passage of a catheter for suctioning.<BR>3.	Patient Safety  The products balloon mechanism is functional.<BR>4.	Safety in urgent care setting - Packaging identifies the size and style of the endotracheal tube.<BR>			<BR>Pricing Analysis Process:<BR><BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their 	best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  <BR><BR>2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the CPT.  The CPT will then make a recommendation to the TPRB with the selected vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Region. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<BR><BR>3.	The Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more clinically equal, price will become more important.<BR><BR>4.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  <BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; i.e., do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor?<BR>c.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. <BR><BR>Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

STATEMENT OF WORK -- CONTRACT ROLE PLAYER SERVICES -- ADVANCED ADMISSIBILITY SECONDARY PROCESSING (AASP) -- ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TRAINING PROGRAM (EOTP) 
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, (CBP) Advanced Training Center, (ATC) Harpers Ferry, West Virginia requires contract role-player services in support of training delivery for course offerings conducted at the Center for a Base year period of December 1, 2008 through November 30, 2009, plus four (4) one year renewal options through November 30, 2013. 
A. SCOPE
1. Role-player services will be provided on a reoccurring basis to multiple classes on a prearranged schedule as supplied by CBP to the contractor. At a minimum role players will be used to support the Advanced Admissibility Secondary Processing (AASP) Course and the Enforcement Officer Training Program (EOTP) conducted during the specified contract period.
2. The AASP course requires up to twelve (12) role-players x eight (8) hours per class. It is estimated that approximately 22 classes will be conducted in a FY = *2,112 est. hours (12 x 8 x 22= 2112). Schedules will be provided to the contractor at least one quarter in advance. The number of hours is subject to change due to National security reprioritizing of CBP mission requirements and may entail discontinuation or reduction in training which may change the number of classes without notice. In the event it is necessary to reprioritize and reduce the number f role players required or cancel a scheduled class, for other than weather or immediate national emergency response, the CBP Contracting Officer Technical Representative shall provide a 48 hour written cancellation notice to the contractor. However, if the cancellation is weather or national emergency response related, a 48 hour notification cannot be guaranteed. 
3. The EOTP course requires up to two (2) role-players x sixteen (16) hours per class. This is estimated at four, 4-hour blocks. It is estimated that there will be up to nine classes in a FY=288 hours. Schedules will be provided to the contractor at least one quarter in advance. In the event it is necessary to reprioritize and reduce the number of role players required or cancel a scheduled class, for other than weather or immediate national emergency response, the CBP Contracting Officer Technical Representative shall provide a 48 hour written cancellation notice to the contractor. However, if the cancellation is weather or national emergency response related, a 48 hour notification cannot be guaranteed. 
Classes for AASP and EOTP are conducted Monday through Friday between the ATC core hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. The specific days and eight or four hour blocks of time the role-players will be needed are dependent upon the overall class schedule start and finish dates. Schedules will be provided one quarter in advance to the contractor, identifying times and dates role-playing services are required. 
B. ROLE PLAYER DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The role-players for the academic AASP and EOTP classes will perform a variety of roles related to Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as material witnesses and defendants and as individuals making application for entry to the United States.
For AASP and EOTP role-playing, the scripted roles and information made available to role-players during the conduct of the practical exercise is not considered law enforcement sensitive and is consistent with that information made available to the traveling public. 
In the event a role-player is needed for a scenario that is law-enforcement sensitive, prior coordination will be made with the contractor for role-players with previous law-enforcement experience. Physical contact for other than academic role-playing will be no more than handcuffing and physical search. 
Role-players must be U.S. citizens, 18 years of age or older.
Contractor personnel who will report to the ATC and serve as Role-players are required to have completed NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK (NACI) ensuring their suitability for the duties required and access to the Advanced Training Center, a secure facility. The NACI allows the assigned personnel to have unescorted access to the ATC.
6. Prior role-player experience is not required 
Any scripts or external props and resources necessary to conduct the practical exercise will be provided by the ATC.
An appropriate dress code for the role-players will be coordinated between CBP and the contractor. CBP reserves the right to reject a role-player for inappropriate dress, actions or other articulable reasons.
A lead role-player will be assigned to ensure an adequate number of role-players are present. Lead role players will ensure a sign-in and sign-out sheet is utilized and that all role-players remain at the designated practical exercise area until the responsible officer has signed the roster and been afforded the opportunity to provide comments, if any, in the space provided.
A roster of the role-players reporting for each practical exercise shall be provided to the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) for verification and certification of invoices submitted for processing.
11. Abide by Customs and Border Protection, Advanced Training Center guidelines for classroom management, integrity and fraternization.
12. All vendor employees having access to the content of the training, will be asked to sign the Confidentiality Agreement provided by the vendor.
C. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
1. The Contractor must conduct Employment Eligibility Verification by requiring applicants to show their U.S. Passport OR a combination of a valid state drivers license AND an original social security card or birth certification (with seal).
Each role-player assigned to work on and within the scope of this purchase order will be required to satisfactorily complete and pass a NACI with the Office of Personnel Management proof of completed background must be supplied to CBP for verification. CBP reserves the right to conduct their own backgrounds checks (no persons with a felony or misdemeanors in the last 8 years will be allowed access).
Contract employees are required to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination. Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials. 
SCA Wage Determination No.: 2005-3017, Revision No.: 6, Date Of Revision: 05/29/2008 is in effect on this solicitation. Website:  http://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/std/05-3017.txt. 
1. What is the GS equivalent of the positions (Role Players)?
Answer:  FAR 52.222-42 — Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires. Instructor $18.49 per hour
2. Is there is an incumbent contractor? If so, what is the pay used under the contract?
Answer:  Khan & Hill.  The current Purchase Order (PO) was awarded originally for only 6 months (NO Base and Option years) and did not require the Service Contract Act Wage Determination (as this new RFQ does).  Pricing $26.20 per hour.
3.  The SOW, item 2 indicates the AASP course requires 12 role players x 8 hours per class and it is estimated that 22 classes will be conducted in a FY = 1728 hours.  My calculation shows 12 x 8 x 22= 2112 hours.  The EOTP course requirement per fiscal year is 288 hours.  Therefore, if 2112 is the correct calculation for AASP, the total hours should be 2400 hours instead of 2016 hours. Please confirm the correct number of hours for the RFQ.
Answer:  The 1728 hours is incorrect.  Total for this should be an estimated 2,112 hours.  The overall hours to quote is 2,400 estimated hours per year (this is changed in Amendment Solicitation.
4.  In the referenced RFQ, it states that “Contractors need to provide three (3) references…”  Does the offeror need to provide the references or does the awardee provide the references?
Answer:  The contractor’s Reference will provide the Questionaire to the contract specialist by e-mail.
5.  Does the Government have a preferred role player male to female ratio?  
Answer:  No, at this time it does not matter.  
6.  Does the Government have a preferred role player military/law enforcement to civilian ratio? Answer:  No, at this time it does not matter. 
7.  Please advise what labor category (on the DOL Wage Determination) should be used or is currently used on the current contract?
Answer:  “15090 TECHNICAL INSTRUCTOR”
8.  Additionally, what is the current contract value?
Answer:  See answer to question number 2 above.
9.  Who is responsible for the cost of conducting a NACI for each role player? 
Answer:  The contractor is responsible for the cost of the NACI.  
10.  Is this a re-compete of an existing contract or a new procurement?
Answer:  See answer to question number 2 above.
11. Are these services currently being commercially provided?
Answer:  Yes.
12.  If there is an existing contract for these services are otherwise commercially provided, what firm is the incumbent vendor?
Answer:  See answer to question number 2 above.
13. If this is a re-compete of an existing procurement, what was the awarded value of the previous contract?
Answer:  See answer to question number 2 above.
14.  Is this wage determined work subject to the Service Contract Act? 
Answer:  Yes.  See Clause and Wage Determination identified in RFQ.
15.  If so, what is the applicable wage determination?
Answer:  See Wage Determination number at bottom of RFQ - “15090 TECHNICAL INSTRUCTOR”
16.  If so, and there is a vendor currently providing this hourly labor service, has the hourly labor rate been indexed against the prevailing wage determination and what is that indexed rate?
Answer:  The current PO did not require SCA.  The future (Option years) employee rate is determined by any revised Wage Determinations needing to be incorporated at the time an Option is exercised. 
17.  We suggest that a Manager be included and that some training time is available to assist in performance?  
Answer:  No, the contractor will designate one of their employees to be the lead and also act as a role player.  
18.  The rates for roleplayers are not currently in the AWD and will have to be conformed. We will suggest a fair rate that includes H&W.
Answer:  See “15090 TECHNICAL INSTRUCTOR” for appropriate rate to be used.  Your company has to determine the Option year pricing (note: if a new wage determination is put into effect, the Wage Determination will be incorporated into the Option Year modification (if the Option year is exercised) IAW Far regulation.
19. FBO version cuts off at the bottom of page 2.  Can you send the rest of the package?
Answer:  “Copy” then “Paste” the RFQ if your computer does not fully print out.

Funding for subsequent years will be contingent upon satisfactory performance and the availability of funds.<BR><BR>Multiple, one to three year awards are anticipated. The maximum total of any award is five (5) years. Most proposals will request less than $200K per year. Larger proposals that combine the efforts of multiple investigators from multiple institutions will be considered if a strong and compelling case is made for such a combined effort, rather than multiple smaller efforts.<BR>

<DESC>The U.S.D.A. Forest Service (FS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) have worked cooperatively under a Conservation Agreement (CA) since 1998 to protect sensitive species on the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area (NRA), including eight butterflies endemic to the Spring Mountains.  Four of these species have been identified as priorities for conservation:  the Mt. Charleston blue butterfly (Icaricia shasta charlestonensis), Morand’s checkerspot (Euphydryas anicia morandi), Spring Mountains acastus checkerspot (Chlosyne acastus robusta), and Spring Mountains dark blue butterfly (Euphilotes enoptes purpura).  These were identified as priority in the CA based on a limited number of locations where the butterflies are currently known to occur.  Autecology studies are imperative to determine why the ranges of these four species are restricted and help provide detailed information necessary to restore and improve butterfly habitat and range.  Given the demand to provide recreation and other uses on the Spring Mountains NRA, there is an urgent need to understand the basic biology and develop a management strategy for these four butterfly species to appropriately inform decision making.  

The Solicitation will be posted at this website on or about 10/30/2008.  If there is a "Pre-Proposal" conference/site walk offered, the details will be in the solicitation, once published.  The technical point of contact is Amy Nichols, (702) 515-5421.  All questions should be submitted in writing via FAX to Contracting Officer at (702) 839-5599 or E-mail at sroehr@fs.fed.us so that we have a record of the question, and can make a determination if the answer needs to be published in the form of a solicitation amendment.

<DESC>Note the additional requirements for access to PSNS for the 3 Nov 08 site visit:
Include a request on company letterhead stating the day and reason of the visit and who will be here etc.  You will then need to fax those to Willow Williamson at (360) 476-6386 so that she can sign as the sponsor and then fax it to security. The form states that security should have it 5 days in advance so we need to get it them as soon as possible.  I believe that you will all need to view a movie at Pass & ID and it may take awhile to get processed so they should get here quite early.
You will need to bring proof of U.S. citizenship (see specifics below) and no cameras, cell phones with cameras etc. or any recording devices (voice or picture). 
REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION:Original proof of U.S. citizenship Acceptable Forms of United States Citizenship Documents: United States Birth CertificateUnited States PassportDept of State Birth CertificateUnited States Naturalization CertificateFS240- Certificate of Person Born Abroad

trucks.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;If

laboratory equipment and supplies such as gas cylinders.<span>&nbsp; </span>The loading dock will also serve as a staging
area for laboratory mobile operations.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
loading dock must be constructed so that the loading surface is essentially the
same height as standard tractor-trailer, thus allowing equipment to be rolled
from a tractor-trailer to the loading doc without the aid to lifting or
lowering equipment.<span>&nbsp; </span>The loading dock
should also be accessible by a ramp to allow for deliveries from smaller
trucks.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;If

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION to gain knowledge of potential capable firms to compete for awards under the anticipated multiple award solicitation. 

The United States Coast Guard (USCG) Acquisition Directorate (CG-9) is seeking potential sources in support of Program Management, Acquisition, and Administrative Support Services for the Acquisition Directorate its respective Major Systems Program/Project Offices.   

An analysis of the Acquisition Directorate’s procurement of professional major systems support services concluded that a more strategic or enterprise-wide approach could be employed to obtain comprehensive professional major systems acquisition support services in support of CG-9 Acquisition Directorate in order to limit the impacts of diminishing resources across the Acquisition Directorate.  

CG-9 has developed three (3) separate Draft Performance Work Statements (PWSs) in the enterprise domain areas of 1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology expertise; 2. Business Management, Studies and Analysis, and Cost; and 3. Acquisition, Contracts Management and Administration Professional support services.  All services to be provided are non-IT.

The conceptual acquisition strategy is to establish separate multiple award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract domains consisting of a basic ordering period of one (1) year and four 1-year optional ordering periods for each enterprise domain area.  Task orders will be competed strictly within the context of each enterprise domain area multiple awards ID/IQ contract.  

The potential program ceiling (over 5 years) for all enterprise domain areas is $20,000 to $650,000,000 and potentially as follows: 1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology - $20,000 – $450,000,000,  2. Business Management, Studies and Analysis, and Cost -  $20,000 – $100,000,000; and 3. Acquisition, Contracts Management and Administration Professional support services - - $20,000 – $100,000,000.  The estimated program ceiling reflects the total value of all actions to be conducted under that multiple award enterprise domain ID/IQ contract area.

This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any synopsis or solicitation.

The purpose of this Request for Information is to seek capability statements from interested small businesses in order to affirm market research of the possibility of setting aside any or all three (3) of these enterprise domain ID/IQ contracts for performance by Small Businesses.

Any “SMALL BUSINESS FIRM”, including Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), HUB-Zone, Service-Disabled-Veteran-Owned, or Woman-Owned, intending to propose as a “PRIME CONTRACTOR” (including those planning to use the affiliation and  teaming rules issued by the SBA) are invited to submit a capability statement to the Government.  Large business requests for capability statement opportunities as a prime contractor are not desired or required at this time.  

While each of the enterprise domain draft Performance Work Statements are separate and distinct from the others, the Acquisition Directorate is only issuing a single Request For Information/Sources Sought Notice.  Contractors may respond to more than one of the enterprise domain areas; however, they must submit separate responses to each area as detailed below.  The conceptual acquisition strategy includes an Organizational Conflict of Interest restriction in the Acquisition, Contracts Management and Administration enterprise domain contract.  This means that contractors that compete on that enterprise domain area will be precluded from competing on contracts in the other areas and vice versa.

This is NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS.  The Government will not award a contract based on this Request for Information nor reimburse participants for information they provide.  This is a request for small businesses interested in serving as prime contractors to submit a brief capability statement demonstrating how they could meet the requirements in each of the enterprise domain areas.   The preliminary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541611, xxxxx Services, with a size standard of $7.0 million.

The contractors will be expected to provide non-personal services for Major Systems Acquisition Professional expertise in support of the enterprise domain areas for the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9), USCG Headquarters, Washington, DC.  This support is broad ranging, comprehensive, complex, and ever changing.  

The resultant contracts will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful offeror from participating in any other United States Coast Guard contracts.  To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Government’s interests, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technical expertise areas of the contractor’s actual CG-9 performance. 

The capability statements should focus on issues that affect the decision as to number/types of small business awards such as: 

(1) the breadth and depth of technical and management expertise to successfully execute all CG-9 Acquisition support services roles within each enterprise domain area,

(2) the capability to quickly ramp up qualified and trained personnel at the onset of the contract and/or task order, 

(3) the capability to administer and manage an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, task order contract with a potential dollar value from $20,000 to $650,000,000 across all domains, with numerous subcontractors, 

(4) assurance and demonstration that the small business firm or small business team will perform 50% of the work, 

(5) capability to perform realistic cost and schedule projections for complex technical and integrated efforts, 

(6) a contract management structure that allows for an integrated organization accountable for total performance responsibility, and 

(7) an understanding of DHS, Navy, DoD, and Government Agencies with whom USCG CG-9 interfaces.  

Firms that can meet requirements set forth above and as identified in a particular enterprise domain draft PWS are requested to provide a capabilities statement and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions. 

This announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the small business community in providing complex professional major systems acquisition support services at the prime contractor level; and (2) to roughly gauge the capability of those interested small business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level.  The Acquisition Directorate is exploring the potential to maximize small business opportunities for CG-9’s Acquisition Major Systems Support Services.  Small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award of a small business multiple award contract.   

The capability statements and associated evaluations discussed in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firm or team’s ability to perform; that evaluation will be part of the formal source selection process. However, these will be utilized to make final decision concerning number and types of enterprise domain areas. 

Submission shall be limited to no more than ten (10) pages for each separate enterprise domain area and must be submitted for each separate enterprise domain area.  

No more than four (4) pages should be used to address the General Contracting/Company Business Information Topics and no more than six (6) pages for each Draft PWS and Requirements related topics.  All questions are listed below.  

Standard brochures and paraphrasing of the PWS will not be considered a sufficient response to this request.  Information provided will not be used as a part of any subsequent solicitation requirement.  Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.
