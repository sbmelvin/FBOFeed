To obtain a copy of the CD and be included on the planholder list, interested bidders must register on our website at www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts.  Visit the website to obtain further instructions about registering.  If you don't provide your DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System) and TIN (Taxpayer Identification Number) on the electronic registration form, we will not send the solicitation to you.  Telephone requests for the solicitation won't be accepted.   There is no charge for the first copy of the CD and $15 for each additional copy requested.  We reserve the right to issue the solicitation on paper if it becomes necessary.   The Office of Management and Budget has instructed all federal agencies to adopt use of the Central Contactor Registration system as a single, government-wide system for storing contractor procurement and payment information.   By October 1, 2003, a vendor must be registered in the CCR in order to receive contracts and purchase orders from most federal agencies, including the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.  CCR is a self-service database.  Vendors register themselves and maintain their own information through the CCR web site. If not already registered, we encourage entities interested in USBR business to register in the system now, to avoid any disruption or loss of awards after the revised regulation takes effect.  To register or learn more about the CCR, go to:  www.ccr.gov/vendor.cfm.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by this agency. See Numbered Note 27.

<ARCHDATE>09032004
<CONTACT>Susie Kramer Contracting Officer 2083785156     skramer@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to issue a solicitation this winter (late 2003) for Spillway and Toe Drain Modifications at Grassy Lake Dam, Wyoming.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 and the size standard is $28.5 million.  The site is not accessible at the time offers will be solicited and received, so we are conducting a site visit this fall so potential offerors can inspect the site conditions, access in and out of the site, living conditions, etc.  Onsite work is scheduled for two construction seasons, July 1 through October 1, 2004, and July 1 through October 1, 2005.  WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO ATTEND THIS SITE VISIT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN COMPETING FOR THE CONTRACT WHEN THE REQUIREMENT IS SOLICITED.    The work consists of replacing a 557-foot section of the concrete-spillway chute and replacing the drainage system in the embankment and  complete removal of a section of the covered spillway beginning at a location downstream from the inlet (station 3+23) and ending just upstream from the stilling basin (station 8+80).  An under-drain system and surface-runoff system will be installed along the spillway alignment, and an open concrete-spillway chute will be constructed.  The drain system along the left and right groins and toe of the embankment will be excavated and replaced with new filters and drains.  Concrete for the spillway will be batched on site.  Processed sand and gravel will filter and drain water from around the drainage pipe.  These materials will likely be obtained commercially from sources near Ashton, Idaho, and delivered via convoy to the site.  The concrete debris from the old spillway chute will be disposed of in an existing borrow site located approximately 1 mile west of the dam site.  No new borrow sites will be needed for the construction. Time and Date of Site Visit: September 25, 2003, at 1:00 p.m. Place to Meet for Site Visit: Meet at the toe of Grassy Lake Dam.  Use the access road off the right abutment to access the toe. Location of Project: The Dam can be reached from Ashton, Idaho, by taking the Ashton to Flagg Ranch Road (1200 N. Road off of State Highway 20) about 1 mile south of Ashton and traveling approximately 36 miles to the east.  The last 22 miles are on Forest Road 261 (FR 261).  Much of FR 261 is a narrow, unimproved, low-volume road which is graded only once or twice a year.  However, this route is the likely access for processed sand and gravel coming from eastern Idaho and should be traveled either on the way in or out of the site to assess the condition of the road. The Dam can also be reached from Jackson Lake, Wyoming, by traveling north 55 miles on U.S. Highway 89 to Flagg Ranch near the south entrance of Yellowstone Park, and then traveling 11 miles west on FR 261.  FR 261 is not maintained in the winter due to severe weather conditions and the remoteness of the area.   The Dam is located at elevation 7200 feet and lies just north of the Teton mountain range.  Snow generally starts to fall in October and continues into May.  The site is not accessible until late June.  For more information on the site visit only, contact Don Rosbaugh at (208) 334-1010.  Please notify Mr. Rosbaugh if you plan on participating in the site visit. This requirement is set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns.   Estimated Price Range of the Project:  $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. Solicitation Availability: The solicitation for this project will be a negotiated, best-value solicitation, that will consider at a minimum, the offerors experience and past performance related to projects of similar difficulty.  Information pertaining to the solicitation for this project will be advertised in the future on our website, www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts/construction.

<DESC>This announcement is in accordance with the provisions of FAR 13.5 test program for commercial items.  The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Martin Associates, Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  The USCG is seeking technical and management support services for an economic impact analysis of a proposed Great Lakes Pilotage rate adjustment.  The USCG Office of Great Lakes Pilotage (G-LPO) is responsible for the oversight of the Great Lakes pilotage program.  This includes the responsibility for auditing financial records of the pilot associations and calculating pilotage rates.  G-LPO accomplishes this objective by following the guidelines and ratemaking procedures contained in Title 46 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 404.  A notice of proposed rulemaking was published proposing to adjust the rates charged in all pilotage areas by an average of 26%.  Due to the magnitude of the rate adjustment and the possibility that it could have an adverse effect on the economy of the Great Lakes basin, the USCG has concluded that a full economic evaluation is necessary to measure the proposed rule’s impact on the economy generally, and more specifically, the local or regional economy with reference to productivity, competition, jobs, state and local taxes, and tribal governments or communities.  Martin Associates was selected for this negotiation because of their unique expertise and past experience with evaluating the impacts of Great Lakes ports activity and the economic impact of the marine transportation system on the Great Lakes.  Martin Associates is in a unique position to most effectively and efficiently provide this service, in that it is the only source for proprietary economic models they developed for the Great Lakes region and ports.  Martin Associates has a unique understanding of the requirements imposed upon the USCG by Executive Order 12866.  Contracting with Martin Associates will avoid a substantial duplication of cost necessary to develop the required economic databases to conduct an economic analysis of the proposed rate increase, which duplication is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Furthermore, no other company is able to provide the required economic analysis to enable the USCG to prepare for December 12, 2003 litigation.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.501.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received from responsible sources by 4:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time, September 10, 2003 at Commandant G-ACS-2B/ef, USCG Headquarters, 2100 Second St., S.W., Washington, DC  20593-0001.  Offers may be faxed to 202-267-4025 or 4019, or may be e-mailed to efeinberg@comdt.uscg.mil.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

NOTES TO OFFERORS

· "Or equals" can be accepted for this acquisition; please submit your quote for only the items specified.

· Please quote all items as F.O.B. Destination

· This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures described at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.404 for a GSA acquisition, and FAR 16.505 for GWAC acquisition.

· At this time we are asking offerors to submit pricing on the items described above, per the terms of your GSA contract, or other GWAC contract.  Special price discounts from your GSA or GWAC contract are certainly encouraged.

· We are requesting GSA or GWAC pricing only, we cannot accept “open market” pricing at this time.

· Have you registered in the Contractor Central Registration (CCR) database yet?  If not, please ensure that your firm is registered.  If you are not registered, you are not eligible for further acquisitions.  Please contact the buyer if you require further information.

· This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures described at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subparts 8.404(b)(2), and 16.505.  At this time we are asking offerors to submit pricing on the items described above, from either a GSA contract, IDIQ contract (also known as “GWAC”, for “Government-Wide Acquisition Contract”), or BPA/BOA.  While price is certainly an important consideration, we will also be heavily considering offeror’s delivery schedules as well, so please submit your offer accordingly.  Features and specifications of the equipment will also be considered of course, as well as warranty terms.

· We at MACDILL contracting/LGCX are becoming more experienced with utilizing the numerous federal contractual vehicles, which are available for Information Technology (I.T.) products.  GSA schedules are recommended to us by the Department of Defense (DoD).  While we still invite GSA offers, we realize that there are many other contractual vehicles (GWAC’s), which may offer advantages over GSA, and we would like to be aware of these alternatives as well.

· Some GWAC’s are easier for us to use than others. Therefore, we must take into consideration the administrative burden involved with placing a delivery order against any given GWAC or GSA contract.  Generally, DoD GWAC’s are easier to use than non-DoD GWAC’s, because of application of the Economy Act. Whenever we wish to place an order against a non-DoD contract (with the exception of GSA), the Economy Act requires us to perform a somewhat lengthy and time consuming process of research, evaluation, and high level briefing and approval before the purchase can be made. This law therefore stands as an impediment to our ability to take advantage of many GWAC’s. However, if a non-DoD GWAC offers significant advantages, we will use it if it is in our best interest. Some GWAC’s, including many within DoD, do not let us place a direct delivery order, but rather require the transference of funds (MIPR) to the cognizant contracting office. This can be an administrative burden as well, and must be considered in the award decision.

· We encourage you to offer us several different alternatives for this acquisition, if you desire.  Also, if you have any helpful suggestions as to how we may improve this internet-based RFQ method, please let us know.  

· The contracting officer will make the determination of the offer that represents the "best value" and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs.

Thank you very much for your participation!

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to purchase and requests quotations for the following Range Simulator System. The Range Simulation System is needed for testing RF Sensors used in weapons systems.  The primary use is to simulate ground approaches and air encounters.  The system, at a minimum, is defined as the RF processing portion of a final testing configuration.  The RF system will receive an external RF signal, process the signal to simulate a velocity, height (or distance from target), and target reflectivity, and output the signal back to the original source.  In order to achieve this end, the following characteristics are necessary for the system: (1) the residual delay in the system must not exceed 12 ft.  The delay must be adjustable in a minimum of 1 ft increments, from 0 to 150 ft.  (2) The attenuation in the system must be selectable  in 1 dB increments.  This adjustable attenuation must range between 0 and 128 dB. (3) Doppler shifting of the processed signal must be possible.  The Doppler shift must range from 0 to 100kHz.  Both positive and negative Doppler shifting is required. (4) The RF system should operate over a wide range, ideally 1 to 18 GHz.  (5) The system bandwidth must be no less than 300 MHz. (6) The simulator system will be able to communicate via an external digital interface that is capable of being controlled by an external PC and an off the shelf test oriented program such as LabView, VEE, and/or MATLAB.  A GPIB interface is desirable. (7) The simulator system will be housed in an enclosure that does not require rack mounting. The three characteristics, delay, attenuation, and Doppler shift, are used to simulate approach towards a target.  Test methods generally involve holding two of t he three characteristics constant while varying the third.  The ability to test in this manner is required.  The ability to simultaneously change two or more of these characteristics is desirable. The warranty unit shall include a 12-month warranty against manufacturing defects. Quantity:  One, delivery:  Six months delivery date is required. The NSWCDD, Dahlgren Procurement Division has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area; therefore, this synopsis with any applicable amendments will be available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nswc.navy.mil/supply.  Hard copies WILL NOT be provided. Vendors should regularly access the NSWCDD Web Site to ensure that they have downloaded all amendments.  Questions concerning this synopsis should be directed to XDS119 on  (540) 653-7478 or emailed to xds11@nswc.navy.mil, but they may also be faxed to (540) 653-7088 or  delivered to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Attn: XDS119, Bldg. 183, Room 102, 17320 Dahlgren Rd., Dahlgren VA 22448-5100 and reference the synopsis number N00178-03-Q-1054. This item will be acquired using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   All items will be priced FOB Destination, Dahlgren, Virginia.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego) intends to award a sole source Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract to Synergy Microsystems, Inc.  This sole source procurement will be conducted using the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  This is not a request for proposal and no solicitation is available.  The contract will provide for the purchase of a maximum of eighteen VSS4/G4 Quad PPC 750 DSP array processor boards for use in the Advanced Modular Electronics Distant Sentinel (AMEDS) Receiver System.  SSC San Diego requires a single-board Array Processor system to perform signal processing, system control, and interface for the Distant Sentinel system.  The board must utilize a VERSAmodule Eurocard (VME64) interface and provide enough processing power for high-speed Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithmic computations.  The array processor system must consist of two SCSI interface ports, two RS-232 Serial interfaces, an Ethernet 10/100 Base-T interface, and a PCI Mezzanine interface.  The array processor must meet the performance minimum of 3.5 GFLOPS and support the LINUX operating system.  The board's physical dimensions must be compatible with the VME64 back plane and comply with chassis volume restrictions.  Delivery to SSC San Diego will be required within 45 days upon issuance of delivery order.  The VSS4/G4 Quad PPC 750 DSP is the only array processor board that meets these requirements and is compatible with the software driver interfaces used in the AMEDS Receiver System.  Use of any other vendor would result in extensive costs associated with having to rewrite all of the software driver interfaces to accommodate a different array processor board.  It is not expected that these costs would be recovered through competition.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego) intends to award a sole source Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract to Eclipse Electronic Systems, Inc.  This sole source procurement will be conducted using the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  This is not a request for proposal and no solicitation is available. The contract will provide for the purchase of a maximum of nine R3100 VMEbus Tuners.  The R3100 VMEbus Tuner is a single-board VERSAmodule Eurocard (VME) dual-channel receiver.  Each receiver must have an input range between 100 to 500 MHz, a high tuning resolution, an IF bandwidth of 10 MHz, and utilize the RACEway data bus.  The intended use of the receiver is to perform RF signal capture and interface with the Advanced Modular Electronics Distant Sentinel (AMEDS) Receiver System.  The VME dual-channel receiver will be utilized in imbedded collection system applications where it is desired to couple the receiver control and output Digital Signal Processing.  The receiver must function in the severe self-induced electromagnetic interference environment encountered in a 37 VME card cage.  The receiver board's physical dimensions must be compatible with the VME back plane and comply with chassis volume restrictions.  Delivery to SSC San Diego will be required within 3 months upon issuance of delivery order.  The R3100 VMEbus Tuner manufactured by Eclipse Electronic Systems is the only receiver that meets these requirements and is compatible with the software driver interfaces used in the AMEDS Receiver System.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Clinical Research, Genetics Branch intends on entering into an agreement with Lynx Therapeutics, Inc., 25861 Industrial Blvd., Hayward, California, 94545.  The services and supplies herein are being procured using the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The purpose of this project is for work supporting extramural and private initiatives for structural characterization of cancers and derived cancer cell lines using "massively parallel signature" sequencing technology.  The goal of this work is to; 1) build a foundation of datasets representing the elucidation of the genome anatomy for selected tumors, cell lines, and cell lineages, 2) integrate these datasets with data on gene expression, morphology, virulence, and other phenotypic parameters and; 3) use the foundation of this work for the formulation of testable hypotheses concerning required steps in the development and progression of cancer, lineage specific mechanisms of instability, genotype-phenotype relationships, and the basis of evolutionary selection or programmatic choice.  We will furthermore sequence relevant breakpoints through the use of long-range PCR with reference to the completed sequence of the human genome. The screening process for sequences of interest is to develop four categories of clones: a) those whose ends are consistent with contiguity of the human genome sequence, b) those whose two ends appear to be discontinuous compared to the human genome sequence and for which we have more than one independent example where the two novel genomic regions are juxtaposed, c) those where we have only one example of a novel juxtaposition but we have additional molecular cytogenetic data to support this novel juxtaposition and; d) those for which we have only one example of a novel juxtaposition (this category would be addressed as the lowest priority).  Lynx Therapeutics, Inc., is the only source known to the National Cancer Institute of their patented technology that offers the sequence coverage necessary for this comprehensive analysis.  Lynx Megaclone Technology is a proprietary technology that captures simultaneously on millions of micro-beads, the DNA "signature ditag," molecules in a sample from a complex mixture of DNA, (e.g. cDNA, genomic fragments, etc.). Each molecule is cloned on a five-micron plastic bead.  Approximately 100,000 copies of each "signature ditag" molecule in the original sample are randomly distributed over the surface of one bead for MPSS "signature tag" sequencing.  Proprietary Lynx Combi-Tags are used for "signature tag" capture.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements unique features, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on September 19, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses t this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Institute of Health (NIH) to procure professional services on a sole source basis with Penelope C. Colbert, Poolesville, MD, to continue services currently being provided by the contractor under purchase order number 467-MZ-301588 for the period of September 30, 2003 to September 29, 2004.  The contractor will continue to provide a range of knowledge of how IMPAC II is used at the grant, program, budget and management areas.  In addition to continuing with the extramural (grants) business at the NIH, technical knowledge of the extramural databases and applications, knowledge and experience with the software development process, Ms. Colbert has over 35 years of government experience which she has gathered invaluable knowledge of the workings of NIH and more recently the entire process of the grants system in relation to IMPAC II.  Her interpersonal skills along with her working knowledge of IMPAC II make her invaluable to the tasks at hand.  Additional funds, time and effort are needed in order for the contractor to complete the project.  Introducing a new contractor at this point in time would add significant amount of training time, government coordination, and therefore costs to the government.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide service as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office within fifteen (15) calendar days from publication date of this notice, and must include pricing information and meet the criteria requirement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H.

<CONTACT>Ravindra Athale, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-696-2206, Email none
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals to exploit emerging photonic technologies for use in intelligent microsystems for sensing, communication, processing, and storage of information through the establishment of University-based Photonics Research (UPR) centers.  The intent is threefold: first, to lay the foundation of next generation photonics technology through university research centers; second, to advance applications of photonics technologies beyond traditional domains by forging interdisciplinary links within the centers; and third, to make the centers national resources for expertise and highly trained individuals.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:

Research in materials and structures for photonic and optoelectronic devices has experienced dramatic new developments over the past five years.  Specific examples involve techniques for tight 3D confinement of photons and electrons via deep sub-wavelength spatial structures as well as novel optical resonant structures.  These structures suggest radically different device designs for generation, modulation, detection, and transport of electromagnetic radiation over a wide frequency range.  Similarly, advances in ultra-short light pulse generation make it practical to realize high peak powers for moderate average power levels using compact sources.  These scientific advances are now ready for applications to intelligent microsystems that will enable novel autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons platforms that are central to future defense strategies.  

The objective of this Research Announcement (RA) is to solicit proposals for the development of revolutionary capabilities leading to specific photonic intelligent microsystems, implemented through university-based, interdisciplinary research centers.  Unfunded participation of industry researchers is strongly encouraged to help guide and focus the centers’ activities toward specific and measurable research goals as well as for transitioning the intermediate results of long term research into products.  The individual research projects proposed, as well as the overall vision of the centers’ research programs should be driven by the goal of creating new paradigms for realizing the required functionalities with higher performance, lower energy requirements, greater environmental stability and adaptive behavior that will help meet the above-cited challenges of intelligent microsystems.  DARPA seeks innovative proposals for the establishment and operation of centers with a well defined vision that addresses specific aspects of the broad technical challenges described above.  A center must be identified with an overarching vision that is captured in specific systems integration demonstrator(s).  Such demonstrator(s) consist of individual projects that are implemented by the researchers at the same or different academic institutions and are cohesively integrated to support the vision of the center.  The ultimate objective of this program will be to integrate outputs from the individual projects into the demonstrator(s).

Additional information on the technical thrust as well as on center organization is provided in the RA 03-37 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE:

Multiple awards for four year efforts are anticipated to be made during the first half of calendar year 2004.  Collaborative effort/teaming between different institutions are encouraged.  A web site—http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams/Login.asp--has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this RA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Dr. Ravindra A. Athale, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: rathale@darpa.mil. 

GENERAL INFORMATION:

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled University-based Photonics Research Centers Program, RA 03-37, University-based Photonics Research Program, Proposer Information Pamphlet which provides further information on University-based Photonics Research, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original, nine (9) hard copies and an electronic copy of the proposal (PDF (preferred)), or MS-Word readable on a CD-ROM, or a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette), and no more than eight power point slides summarizing the critical aspects of the proposal to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (ATTN: RA03-37), on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday October 24, 2003, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Proposals submitted after the due date specified in the RA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the RA 03-37 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total RA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this RA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable topics in University-based Photonics Research.

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this RA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding RA 03-37.  Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (1) overall scientific and technical merit of individual projects and the proposed systems integration demonstrator(s) with special focus on the originality and their potential impact on the field; (2) potential contribution and relevance of the main vision to the DARPA and DoD mission; (3) specific plans for coordinating the various projects with each other and with the goals of the systems integration demonstrator(s) for the center and for on-going management of the projects, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-03-00417, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition  Circular 01-15.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $6.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.   A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of  this solicitation.  This  procurement is for protein isolation, mass spectroscopy identification and protein sequencing. The period of performance will be 12 months from date of award with two 12 month option periods.  The option periods will be exercised at the option of the Government. The services required shall provide  for identification proteins altered following exposure to environmental chemicals.  As such the contractor shall perform 2-D gel electrophoresis of paired protein samples and identify proteins whose expression is altered by exposure to environmental chemicals.  Proteins shall be identified using  Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time Of Flight (MALDI) mass spectrometry. In this technique, the sample is mixed with a matrix, commonly cyanohydroxycinnamic acid for peptides or sinapinic acid for  proteins and dried. When irradiated with a nitrogen laser, the matrix adsorbs energy  which is transferred to the peptide molecule which desorbs into the gaseous phase. An electric field accelerates it, and by measuring the time it takes to reach a detector, the mass can be determined. In some cases, samples are analyzed by loading into an ion trap mass spectrometer using an  ElectroSpray Interface (ESI).  In some cases the EPA will provide the contractor samples of isolated protein for identification by the contractor using  Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time Of Flight (MALDI) mass spectrometry.  When necessary, the contractor shall also sequence protein  samples provided by the EPA using standard methodologies.  Contractor shall provide protein identification using MALDI mass analysis techniques from  protein samples provided by the EPA.  Upon request by EPA, the contractor shall confirm the identity of proteins by amino acid sequencing.   Contractor shall perform 2-D gel electrophoresis on paired samples.  These gels shall be scanned using densitometric or fluorescent methodologies.  Limited comparisons of paired gels may also be requested.   A maximum of 10 paired protein samples for 2-D gel electorphoresis/year shall be performed.   Following limited comparisons of paired gels, no more than 5 altered protein spots shall be isolated for identification. Proteins will be extracted from gel punches and subjected to MALDI mass analysis.  The chemical identity of these proteins will be determined after mass analysis by searching  the protein mass database. The following analysis are required for each period of performance: 1) a  minimum of 10 and maximum of 20 2-D gel isolation; a minimum of 15 and maximum of 110 MALDI Mass analysis and protein ID; and a minimum of 5 and maximum of 15 protein sequencing. Deliverables are:  1. Provide the chemical identity of proteins from samples provided by EPA; 2. Provide amino acid sequencing of proteins supplied by EPA; and 3. Provide electronic copies of scanned 2-D gels.  All deliverables are due within the 12 month performance period.  The government will supply the contractor  with sufficient amounts of protein samples to be identified.  Proteins will be submitted as either homogenates for 2-D gel electrophoresis analysis or as  punches from Sypro-Ruby stained 2D SDS-PAGE gels.  The Contractor shall provide, as they become available, hard copies and/or electronic files  of 2-D gels, protein mass analysis data,  protein mass database search results and amino acid sequencing results. The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. Evaluation criteria to be included  in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES CRITERIA: 1) Provide a brief explanation of facilities and methods of protein analysis. 2) Deadlines-Demonstrate the ability to provide service in a timely fashion, meeting deadlines and interacting with end-users in  a timely fashion. 3.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to award a sole source award to Dr. James R. Alms, Professor of the Economic Department at Georgia State University, for development of alternative methodology to estimate the gross revenue of informal suppliers. The study shall develop a proposal for how the contractor’s estimate of the gross revenue of informal suppliers can be employed with the IRS National Research Program (NRP) and exact match studies on reporting and filing noncompliance to generate and estimate of the informal supplier tax gap.  The study shall include the following elements: a recommendation concerning how to adjust the gross revenue figure for informal suppliers to arrive at a net income estimate, advice on how to account for net informal supplier income that is either reported or detected in the NRP, and exact match studies to avoid double-counting/overestimation of the informal supplier tax gap and guidance on how to allocate undetected informal supplier income between filers and non-filers of tax returns.  The study will provide a comparative analysis of the contractors’ proposed methodology for estimating the informal supplier tax gap in relation to the approach previously employed by the IRS.  This task shall include a statistical validation of the gap estimates by comparing them to the results from the University of Michigan surveys from the 1980s.  This statistical analysis shall include: a comprehensive documentation of the past methodology employed by the IRS to estimate the informal supplier tax gap, a critical evaluation and comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, and a thorough comparison of the current estimate to that of the University of Michigan surveys to form a basis of calibration.  The contractor shall deliver a preliminary report describing the nature of the problem, the relative merits of the available data, and a recommended strategy for developing an estimate of the gross federal income tax gap for informal suppliers, the main findings of this preliminary report will be presented to members of the IRS Compliance Analysis Group, and a final report that addresses the comments and input received from the IRS concerning the preliminary report.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, all interested parties who identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement, will be considered.  No solicitation will be issued, therefore, all requests for the solicitation will be considered non-responsive.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) plans to procure on a sole souce basis with University of Michigan Medical School, Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to obtain one-time access to early stage lung adenocarcinoma specimens and their associated clinical data to be analyzed in a lung profile confirmation study. The Cancer Diagnosis Program has overall responsibility for planning, evaluation and coordination of NCI research related to cancer diagnostics. Lung Cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer deaths in the United States.  Up to 40% of  “early stage” lung cancer patients will die of the disease.  Three projects in the Director’s Challenge initiative have reported gene expression profiles that identify clinical subsets of stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients.  Each research group has identified a subset of patients with a significantly worse outcome than the majority of stage I patients.  These molecular profiles are particularly promising since all three academic groups used different analytical platforms and used different criteria for the selection of specimens for analysis.  This information is of great clinical importance because it has the potential to identify patients who will be cured by surgery alone, as well as those for whom improved therapy needs to be developed.  Although this data is exciting, it needs to be confirmed on a larger set of tumors using standardized protocols which is the purpose of this procurement. The work to be performed under this contract requires access to early stage lung adenocarcinoma obtained from patients with the appropriately documented clinical follow-up as well as appropriately standardized and documented surgical procedures.  These specific specimens are needed to confirm the diagnostic utility of gene expression signatures for predicting outcome after surgery for early stage lung adenocarcinoma. There are very few large collections of frozen specimens that meet these criteria.  The investigators involved in this study were identified as having the required frozen tumors, expert clinicians and pathologists, and access to expert gene expression analysis, statistical analysis and appropriate database support.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 19, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Finance Board is seeking to acquire an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) System (i.e., risk management software) to serve as the infrastructure (i.e., software platform) to measure the market risk exposures of each of the FHLBanks. The base system software would be used to measure the market Value at Risk (VaR) of the FHLBanks, individually and as a group.

The base system will also be used to perform a comprehensive market-value-of-portfolio-equity (MVPE) sensitivity analysis. This includes generating “market value” reports showing the estimated present value of an institution’s portfolio under a variety of interest rate scenarios. The system must be capable of accurately and efficiently valuing and calculating risk analytics on a large number of fixed-income assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items. It is essential that all valuation and risk analysis be conducted using a lattice or Monte Carlo approach fully taking into consideration any embedded optionality, and incorporating implied volatility as a risk factor.

This is a firm fixed price contract except for software installation, user training, and technical support which are on a time and materials basis. For more information, contact David A. Lee, Senior Acquisition Official, Office of Management, Federal Housing Finance Board, 1777 F Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006, voice: 202/408-2514; facsimile: 202/408-2895; email: leed@fhfb.gov.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR QUESTION 5.  ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE SOLICITATION REMAIN UNCHANGED.  Question 5:  All systems: Is the load size for the systems one [1], 6 wafer maximum or multiple wafers, if multiple how many? [Note; If multiple the next step is a load of four or six.]  REVISED ANSWER TO QUESTION 5: The systems must accept small samples up to 6 inch wafer size. Multiple wafers may fit on substrate chuck.  NIST performs research applications and processing of silicon devices, and the number of wafers varies with the project work. On average 1-5 wafers are processed at one time. They are 3", 4", 6" and occasionally 8" wafers. About 45% of the work is performed on small samples (6mm-25mm).

<DESC>The mission of the Mine Safety and Health Administration carries out the mandates of the Mine Act at all mining and mineral processing operations in the United States, regardless of size, number of employees or commodities.

As part of this mission, MSHA has need of the ability to measure exposure to potentially harmful levels of respirable coal mine dust.  This will allow the user to determine when engineering controls are functioning to control the levels of respirable dust, when action must be taken to prevent overexposure, and at what point during a working shift unacceptable levels of respirable dust occurred so that the control system can be adjusted to prevent future exposure.

In order to facilitate the gathering of this information, the Directorate of Coal Mine Safety and Health has a need to purchase 10 PDM-1 Personal Dust Monitors, manufactured by Rupprecht & Patashnick, of Albany New York.

Rupprecht & Patashnick (R&P) hold patents on the only existing technology that allows for the continuous determination of respirable coal dust in real time.

The PDM-1 will be purchased on a sole-sources basis with Rupprecht & Patashnick (R&P), unless another company can provide capability with exact requirements and technology required by Mine Safety and Health Administration.  Telephone and Fax request will be accepted (phone 304-256-3367 or 304-256-3388, fax 304-256-3332). Any response should be received on or before September 10, 2003.

Limitations for machines that will be utilized in a transportable shelter will be a height requirement of less than seven foot, and shorter than 75 inches. All machines will need to have a lock down function that enables this equipment to be secured and transported, then set back up in a minimal amount of time. The software for the CNC equipment will need to be of a type, which can be easily t ransported between the various user units and must be a standardized universal commercial version. Broken Bolt Extraction Tools and Tool Sets. These could be sets, individual tools or pieces of equipment to remove broken bolts of various sizes in use by th e Army.    Hydraulic RAM Press: various sizes that range from 10 ton to 100-ton ram and press sets.  Drill Press Machines:  Floor and Bench mounted.  Multi-Functional Tools Sets: These are tool sets that are specifically designed with the capability to per form multiple functions or maintenance tasks on wheeled and tracked vehicles currently in use by the Army, with the intent of lessoning the logistics footprint.    Additional Information: At this time the tool sets that the US Army is starting their review on will evolve into two general programs; they are the Allied Trades and Industrial Plant Equipment program. Our intent is to use the commercial market place as a springboard to assist us in developing our requirements based on the best commercial equipment and prices available for the soldier in the field. The Allied Trades system will either be enclosed in a shelter and or truck mounted, that will be transported a nd employed throughout worldwide battlefield conditions and which will be subject to all types of environmental conditions and terrain to include extremes of hot, cold, sand and dust.  The Industrial Plant Equipment will be of a manufacturing type that wil l generally be used for Field Level Maintenance (formerly known as Direct Support Maintenance) and, Sustainment Level Maintenance (formerly known as General Support and Director of Logistic (DOL) level type of work) to include fixed facilities as well as m obile maintenance facilities.  This equipment may be located at rear echelon areas or base locations that may or may-not be environmentally controlled.

<DESC>Notice of Intent/Request for Qualifications – No. HE703
August 29, 2003
Facility 9720-82
BWXT Y-12, L.L.C.

PURPOSE:  

BWXT Y-12, L.L.C. (BWXT Y-12), acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22800 with the United States Department of Energy (DOE) at the Y-12 National Security Complex, is soliciting Statements of Qualification (SOQ) for the construction of a new building/facility known as, “9720-82”, at the Y-12 National Security Complex located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The value of the facility construction is estimated to be in the range of $40 to $60 million dollars.  It is the intent of BWXT Y-12 to secure a construction firm capable of performing the required construction activities for this project.
 
This notice to solicit Statements of Qualification does not constitute an invitation for sealed bids or a request for proposal.  This request is for the purpose of determining interested and qualified firms.  Responses received will be evaluated to determine the shortlist of firms to receive the Request for Proposals (RFP). Technical documents for this project will contain Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information and Official Use Only information which requires special information security preparations on the part of the shortlisted firms prior to receiving the RFP. All subcontractor personnel working on this project must be United States citizens. Offerors must be able to obtain a favorable Foreign Ownership, Control, or Interest (FOCI) determination from the Government in order to be eligible for subcontract award.

If you do not respond to the Request for Qualifications (RFQ), you will not be eligible for the subsequent procurement actions. The forecast for issuing the Request for Proposals is January 2004.

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT & SCOPE OF WORK:   
  
The planned building footprint is approximately 450 feet by 300 feet with a height of approximately 40 feet. See Attachment 1 for artist‘s rendering. The construction site is approximately 7 acres and is at the Y-12 National Security Complex. Physical access to the site will be from Tennessee State Route 95 and Bear Creek Road West. The work location does not require Q-Cleared workers, but all construction personnel must be United States citizens with assigned identification badges and vehicle passes. Construction work at the Y-12 National Security Complex requires the successful firm to become signatory to the Construction Labor Agreement with the Knoxville Building and Construction Trades Council. 

Work scope consists of procurement of materials and installation of the following:  

Site Work--Excavation and backfill for underground utilities, grading, underground and above ground utility installation, trenches, access roads, erosion control, and site restoration.

Civil/Structural—Administrative offices, mechanical/electrical and storage areas consisting of seismically qualified, cast in place, reinforced concrete building foundations, walls, and columns, structural steel racks/supports, roofing, and loading docks.

Architectural--Suspended ceiling, sheet rock, cubicles, lockers, restroom facilities/partitions, interior and exterior doors, scuppers, downspouts, signs, insulation, and painting.

Mechanical--Zoned building pressurization, including Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, utility piping, fire protection, and plumbing.

Electrical--Power, lighting, grounding, communication, and alarm systems.

Controls--Instrumentation packages for security and utility systems.

Equipment--Installation of government and subcontractor furnished equipment including piping, electrical components, and instrumentation. 

Testing Support--Test, checkout, and startup support for systems, structures, and components.  

Quality Control/Quality Assurance--Requirements will be per DOE 414.1A.

PROCUREMENT PROCESS:  

BWXT Y-12 intends to award an evaluated competitive firm-fixed price subcontract to the successful offeror that best meets the project’s goals and objectives.  Selection will be based on best-value using a two-phased approach of a Request for Qualifications and a Request for Proposals. Phase 1 (Request for Qualifications) will request that firms respond to evaluation factors regarding Past Performance & Experience, Technical Capabilities, and Organization & Personnel Qualifications. From the responses received, BWXT Y-12 will evaluate and score the Statements of Qualification against the RFQ evaluation criteria to down-select to a shortlist of firms to receive the Request for Proposals.  No pricing is to be included in Phase 1. Notices will be forwarded to offerors upon completion of the SOQ evaluations to inform them if they made the shortlist to receive the RFP. 

Offerors selected to receive the RFP must comply with BWXT Y-12 information security requirements prior to receiving the design documents. Phase 2 (Request for Proposals) will request that firms respond to technical evaluation factors such as, but not limited to, Project Management Plan & Business Management, Organization & Personnel, and Socioeconomic and Affirmative Action Plans and provide Pricing. The basis for award will be the firm offering the best overall value, considering price, the technical RFP submittals, and the SOQs evaluated under the Request for Qualification. Subcontract award is anticipated in September 2004, but will ultimately depend on the availability of funding.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) serves as a service center to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) for research and development contracts.  The NIDCR is conducting a market survey to assess the availability and potential technical capability of small business firms to perform as the Coordinating Center for the project entitled: Clinical Trial of Topical Thalidomide for Aphthous in Patients with HIV/AIDS.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size is 500 employees.  The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of a novel topical thalidomide formulation for healing of aphthous ulcers associated with HIV/AIDS in a Phase II/III clinical trial of 160 subjects.  The predicted outcome is that a topical route of administration for thalidomide will result in lesion healing and diminution of pain without the adverse effects inherent in a systemic dose.  The Coordinating Center shall be capable of conducting all aspects of a multi-center clinical trial for the treatment of aphthous stomatitis in patients with HIV/AIDS using a topical formulation of thalidomide. The Coordinating Center will have overall responsibility for the operation of the clinical trial and will be responsible for performing the following tasks: 1) Identify up to 10 clinical sites capable of recruiting study subjects 18 years of age or older with HIV infection or AIDS who are experiencing painful oral lesions. Clinical sites identified must be capable of recruiting approximately 10 - 12 patients per year for up to two years, with each subject evaluated weekly and followed up to four weeks beyond study entry. 2) Select and enter into subcontracts with clinical sites by the end of the 3rd contract month and complete site selection by the end of 6th contract month. 3) Using the existing NIDCR protocol, which has been approved by the FDA, and in collaboration with the Government Project Officer, develop, disseminate and revise, as needed, Standard Operating Procedures. 4) Randomize patients and coordinate with the NIH pharmacy, drug dissemination to the clinical sites and maintain appropriate control records.  Note: The government (NIH) holds the IND for the test article (drug) and will supply the drug for the study. 5) Assist clinical sites in obtaining and maintaining IRB approval and track protocol violations. 6) Establish a data management plan and possess a computer data storage system that will receive, inventory, and store all information. 7) Perform data analyses of all study data.  8) Comply with DHHS Automated Information Systems Security Program (AISSP) Handbook found at this location: http://irm.cit.nih.gov/policy/aissp.html.  Small business firms having demonstrated experience in performing tasks 1-8 above are invited to submit capability statements (original and three copies).  Capability statements must provide evidence of experience in performing the tasks described above and demonstrate the following: 1) Qualifications and availability of personnel with experience pertinent to the management and operation of a multi-center clinical trial in HIV/AIDS and/or oral research; 2) Experience in the analysis and interpretation of medical data for the purpose of ensuring patient safety and privacy. 3) Knowledge of regulatory requirements such as HIPAA, GCP, FDA (specifically IND), and human subject protections, including practices of quality control and quality assurance, data and safety monitoring procedures, and IRB policies and procedures. 4) Adequacy of the organizational and administrative structure to participate in a multi-center clinical trial in HIV/AIDS and/or oral research, both in the collection of data from multiple clinical sites as well as experience in monitoring the quality and timeliness of data. 5) Facilities and resources necessary for the performance of the requirements listed above. 6) The firm’s status as a small business under NAICS code 541710.  Capability statemennts in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP), and responses should not include budgetary information.  The RFP release date is pending.  The government intends to negotiate one contract for a period of four years with an approximate award date of August 31, 2004.  Firms responding to this market survey should provide information pertinent to the requirements mentioned above (original and three copies) within (15) calendar days from the date of this announcement to the address shown above.

<ARCHDATE>10122003
<CONTACT>George Anna Mallory, Contracting Officer, (505) 816-1290
<DESC>The American Indian Management and Trust Reform Act of 1994 mandates that the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) provide better management and accountability of Indian trust funds.  This evaluation will help OST better manage Indian Trust lands.  Interior is hereby soliciting information ascertaining whether appraisals prepared by the OST, Office of Appraisal Services (OAS), tribal staff appraisers, and third-party contract appraisers are consistent with generally recognized industry right of way valuation methods and techniques, and at a minimum, meet the requirements of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (USFLA), where applicable.  Identification and discussion of any deviations from industry standards, and recommendations to correct any inconsistencies identified will be required.  The work will be performed at twelve (12) OST OAS Regional Appraiser offices throughout the United States, and may involve coordinated discussions with the Bureau of Indian (BIA) Regional Realty offices, tribal offices, and or, tribal land owner associations.  The 12 OST OAS Regions include:  Pacific (Sacramento, CA.), Southern Plains (Lawton, OK.), Southwest (Albuquerque, NM), Western (Phoenix, AZ.), Alaska (Anchorage, AK.), Eastern Oklahoma (Muskogee, OK.), Great Plains (Rapid City, SD.), Midwest (Ashland, WI.), Navajo (Gallup, NM), Northwest (Portland, OR.), Rocky Mountain (Billings, MT.), and Eastern (currently vacant).  The specifics for the effort to analyze the rights of way valuation methodology applied by OAS will include:  (1) obtain two right of way appraisals involving tribal land;  (2) obtain two right of way appraisals involving allotted lands (except for the OAS-Navajo Region); (3) for the OAS Navajo Region, obtain four right of way appraisals involving tribal lands and four right of way appraisals involving allotted lands, (a) two of which will be from the set of 55 appraisals cited in the report titled "Site Visit Report of the Special Master to the Office of Appraisal Services in Gallup, New Mexico, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs Navajo Realty Office in Window Rock, Arizona", and (b) two from the set of seven appraisal cited in the same report. The evaluation of these appraisal practices and procedures should be based on the scope of work as specified by USPAP and the USFLA consistent with (1) the expectations of participants in the market for the same or similar appraisal services; and (2) what the appraiser's peers' actions would be in performing the same or similar assignment in compliance with USPAP and USFLA.  The prevailing generally recognized industry appraisal methodologies of right of way include, but are not limited to:  1. Before and After Method, Federal Rule and State Rule; 2. Across the Fence; 3. Taking + Damages Method; 4. Corridor Valuation Technique.  Pursuant to Standard 3 of USPAP, "the client" will be identified as the OST for all appraisal reviews.  Records Research:  All easements and right of way require the approval of the BIA before they are valid.  These approved documents are then recorded at the BIA Regional Land Titles and Records Office (LTRO).  OST, working in conjunction with the BIA senior management, will assure that the contractor has access to all the necessary trust records located at the BIA Regional LTRO's, BIA Regional and Agency Offices, OST-OAS Offices, tribal offices and tribal land owner associations.  Deliverables include:  (1) an evaluation report for each OAS Regional Appraisal Office; (2) an individual USPAP Standard 3 review statement for each right of way appraisal reviewed; and (3) one overall OAS evaluation report describing the findings of the contractor, and recommendations to address inconsistencies of right of way appraisal practices from Region to Region.  All evaluation work and reviews shall be performed by State Certified General Appraisers having expertise in right of way valuations (e.g., fiber optics, oil and gas transmission lines, power lines, roads, water lines, corridors, irrigation delivery systems, etc.) Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications:  (1) Experience:  An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed.  Identify any previous experience pertaining to valuation of Indian trust lands.  (2) Personnel:  Name(s), professional qualifications and specific experience of the State Certified General Appraiser(s) who may be assigned to this project.  Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted. Security Clearances are required.  In responding interested persons should identify any existing Government mechanisms such as GSA contracts or GWACs that they hold that could be used to satisfy this requirement.  Although the Government does not anticipate using FAR Part 12 commercial items procedures, interested persons may identify their capability to satisfy the requirement with a commercial item.  Responses should be submitted within 5 working days of this notice.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Licensing Opportunity for Unique High Efficiency, High Voltage Conditioned Power Supply Design
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is actively soliciting industry partners to license, manufacture, and sell a uniquely designed miniature modular high voltage power supply system. The design adds voltage regulation, current sinking, current monitoring, and an electronic float to high voltage DC-DC converters.  The system will efficiently power devices at high voltages (5000+ volts) and low currents (30-500 µAmp) with low power consumption.  The design provides a constant current mode, robustness to breakdown, and extremely efficient operation, all in a small package.  We believe these unique features make it an ideal low-cost solution for scientific and engineering applications that require robust high voltage power, regulated voltage, current monitoring, and a float capability. We believe it will find applications in many areas, including drug delivery systems, medical applications, portable detection and analysis devices, and a host of electronic devices in both existing and emerging markets.

If your company has the technical capability and manufacturing capacity to produce these devices for government and commercial applications, and if you wish to pursue this unique opportunity, please email a brief description of your company, your contact information, and your interests in this venture to: Partnerships-CA@sandia.gov. You will be contacted by a licensing representative who will discuss the requirements and steps for procuring a license.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Developed software designed to Perform Simulation of Analog Electronic Circuits
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratory has developed software designed to perform simulation of analog electronic circuits.  The software consists of schematic capture, simulation, and post processing analysis components.  The simulation component is based largely on SPICE technology and contains enhancements for features of interest to Sandia, mainly targeted at simulating large circuits.  The other components are Sandia designed and developed with the same emphasis of simulating large circuits.  This software is intended for engineers working to develop new electronic designs and to test modifications of existing designs.  The software allows engineers to graphically enter a design, analyze the behavior of the design, and modify the design to iterate toward an optimal design.  It can also be used to characterize existing designs and analyze how these might fail if modified. Sandia is seeking partnerships to commercialize this technology. For further information, please respond by mail or fax (no phone calls, please!)to Alane Dulski within two weeks at: Sandia National laboratories, MS 0115, P.O.

Literature review available.”” Q18: How does the plan receive recovery from FECA should this plan, as primary, pay a FECA claim? A18: Insurance carriers may learn after having made payment on a claim that it was a worker’s compensation claim. They should submit a completed HCFA-1500 or facsimile listing procedures, charges, and paid amounts for each individual provider (including tax identification number), and should attach signed certification of the payments made by the insurance company. Any third party payee, such as a health insurance company, must be entered in the Provider Master File, using the corporate Tax Identification Number for payment to be made. Q19: Who determines whether a pre-existing condition is precipitated, aggravated, or accelerated by Peace Corps service? Is their decision final, or can it be appealed? A19: The U.S. Dept of Labor determines whether or not a condition is Peace Corps related. This decision is based upon the opinion of medical providers, medical and physical evidence. The Returned Volunteer or Peace Corps can appeal this decision. Q20: How will the transfer of current enrollees be handled at the March 1, 2004 effective date? A20: The new Contractor shall work with the existing Contractor to assure an effective transition period using insurance industry acceptable run-out times for the payment of claims. The Contracting Officer may negotiate a conversion period of no less than thirty (30) days with the incumbent; providing, but not limited to, extension of coverage for conversion and/or conversion contracts, providing benefits to an enrollee until the effective date of the new enrollment, and processing and paying claims incurred prior to the mutually agreed coverage end date. Q21: Does Peace Corps intend to continue the exact coverage currently in effect? (i.e. covered benefits, exclusions, deductibles, co-payments, etc.) A21: No, but the coverage must include the minimums listed in the Statement of Work. Q22: Because this is a COBRA style benefit program, it is imperative to have three years of historical detailed claims and membership experience to submit a competitive price and work within a more level playing field with the current contractor. These reports are standard in the insurance industry and should be easily available from the current contractor. To be able to work with carriers for the best rate possible, potential offerors are requesting the following information: Most recent three years of experience that includes Patient ID, Diagnosis Codes, Procedure Codes, Service Type, Service Date, Paid Date, Billed Amount, and Paid Amount. The patient ID should be scrambled so that the patient cannot be identified, but it should allow bidders to group claims by patient. Most recent three years of membership summaries by month. The summaries should include the number of volunteers and the number of dependents. A22: Please note that the claims experience by categories is a quarterly report and is not cumulative and is sorted by policy year. Peace Corps does not have three full years of reports; however, a review of the quarterly reports (may be faxed in response to a formal written request on company letterhead faxed to the Contracting Officer) combined with the loss ratio should provide the information needed to form a picture of the program’s performance. Q23: What is the current enrollment process for the first month of coverage paid by Peace Corps? A23: An eligibility file, which includes a listing of all volunteers entering service and terminating service, is transmitted electronically to the carrier on a weekly basis. An invoice is generated listing all volunteers who leave service during the previous month. Q24: What is the current enrollment process for RPCVs desiring to continue coverage? A24: At the end of service each volunteer is told of the insurance benefit and is given an extension form. This is controlled by the RPCV’s signature attesting to being given this information. RPCVs may elect to have payments made from their re-adjustment allowance (stipend accumulated during Peace Corps service), or pay by credit card or check directly to the carrier. Q25: What is the current process for distributing marketing brochures and materials? A25: The carrier sends by the appropriate method (regular mail or DHL –type express service) annual plan change enrollment brochures with cards to each Peace Corps office. Peace Corps supplies the most current address and advises on the best way of getting information out. If there is more than 6 weeks lead-time, Peace Corps will use its international diplomatic pouch service provided by the U.S. Dept of State. Peace Corps replenishes marketing brochures and fulfillment cards. Q26: What is the current process for distributing ID cards to the RPCVs? A26: Cards are distributed with the extension brochure at close of service. Q27: Are updated mailing addresses available for RPCVs when they end their active volunteer status? A27: The most current mailing addresses are those supplied by the RPCV on their extension forms. Q28: Are e-mail addresses available for RPCVs? A28: They are available as supplied by the RPCV on their extension forms. Q29: Do RPCVs typically have access to e-mail while traveling overseas after completion of active service? A29: Many do and the number is increasing each year. Peace Corps Office of Medical Services, Health Benefits Program Manager is Ms. Lorna D.

<DESC>The High Energy Laser (HEL) Joint Technology Office (JTO), Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Albuquerque, New Mexico, solicits white papers for science and technology projects required to support development of directed energy weapon (DEW) systems. The OSD HEL JTO program develops and executes a DoD-wide, coordinated management and investment strategy to take advantage of opportunities presented by advances in HEL technologies. The JTO vision is that HELs will be a viable weapons alternative in modern warfare. The JTO mission is to lead DoD’s integrated development of HEL weapon technology.  The JTO’s objective is to make HELs lightweight, affordable, supportable, and effective on the modern battlefield.  The program will promote projects, research, scientific studies, or other initiatives providing farsighted, high payoff research leading to advances in HEL science and technology. The HEL JTO has established a two-step process for offerors submitting a white paper under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Part 1 requires submission of a white paper for evaluation and notification; Part 2 requires an oral presentation.  The HEL JTO must receive papers submitted in response to this announcement by 1600 MST on 3 October 2003. The expected award date is March 15, 2004.  Approximately $11M in awards may be made in FY04; JTO estimates a $22M budget for all projects for fiscal years 04 and 05.  However, there is no certainty in the level of funding. The white paper shall consist of a technical section, ROM cost, a schedule, and resumes.  Final detailed instructions for preparing and submitting each component herein is found below and in external sources referenced. The white paper, subsequent oral presentation, proposed contractor-developed Statement of Work (SOW) and cost proposal submitted by an offeror in response to this BAA are the only vehicles available to the offeror for receiving consideration for award.  This program shall issue no other solicitation relating to this requirement for FY 2004. Offerors should consult FedBizOpps, the Government –wide point of entry for any amendments to this BAA.   The Government reserves the right to award a procurement instrument best suited to the nature of the technology development proposed.  White papers may be for projects that can be completed within a year of award, or may be for multiple-year (maximum two (2) year) projects, if the subsequent year can be funded (separately priced) as an individual option with clearly defined milestones and deliverables in each year. The Government may award to all, some, or none of the proposals received.  If the Government fails to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror(s), the Government may conduct negotiations with another acceptable offeror. The Government avails this requirement to unrestricted full and open competition.  The HEL JTO encourages all businesses (including small businesses), academia, and civilian government agencies to propose on this solicitation. Offerors must indicate if they are small, small disadvantaged, 8(a) certified, woman-owned, or hub-zone certified.  The HEL JTO encourages teams and partnerships among commercial entities, academia, and government agencies.  All DOD FFRDC’s, may submit proposals responding to this announcement. Other FFRDC’s, the C3I Lab, Lincoln Laboratory, Software Engineering Institute or contractors, that propose using FFRDC’s not discussed herein shall provide rationale in their proposal justifying that the research falls within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort or special competency of the FFRDC, and that proposed research will not compete with the private sector.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this acquisition is 541710; the size standard is 500 employees.  Support contractors may read, review, and/or administratively handle all white papers.  Employees of the Federal government and support contractors to OSD/HEL JTO are individually bound by appropriate nondisclosure requirements with signed nondisclosure and organizational conflict of interest statements and are prohibited from competition in this technical area. Offerors shall sign and return with their white papers a consent to administrative access, AFMCFARS 5352.215-9007 “Use of Non-government Advisors,” located on the internet at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.  Offerors may have access to or may generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution, and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.  Submit no classified white papers.  Foreign owned firms should contact the contracting officer before submitting a white paper to determine whether you are eligible to receive an award.  For eligibility for award, non-government offerors must also register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database pursuant to Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Subpart 204.73. Any offeror who is not registered may register at http://www.ccr.gov. Alternatively, offerors may phone 1-877-DLA-CALL. Offerors not registered should register immediately. Find Air Force CCR guidance and information at http://www.safaq.hq.af.mil/contracting. Statement of Problem/Objective: Projects proposed under this BAA must address a current or projected HEL capability or enabling technology shortfall that 1) is unique to DEW’s, and 2) that requires advanced development or maturation of some technology to overcome.  Non-HEL programs may also benefit from the technology developed or matured in the proposed project, but clearly delineate the HEL requirement. The Government may consider beyond the scope of this solicitation any proposal that seek to satisfy a HEL requirement by simply combining existing technologies in a novel way via integration or engineering projects,.  Development of technologies that will support the HEL requirements (or reasonable, educated predictions thereof) of general classes of DEW’s particularly interests the Government.Technology development that supports the HEL requirements of a single, specific, active DE acquisition program also interests the government. See areas of potential technology development under this BAA in attachment one. These illustrate the scope of this BAA and indicate broad areas of government interest.  They do not document current technology shortfalls for HEL’s and do not consider them HEL requirements.  Offerors developing white paper proposals under this BAA shall identify HEL requirements sufficiently to support the S&T work they propose.  The HEL JTO encourages multiple submissions in one or more areas you may consider having a high probability of interest to the HEL community.  White paper preparation and submission instructions: Submit firm offers valid for at least 180 days. Prepare separate white papers for each technical area (found above in “Statement of Problem/Objectives”) the offeror is pursuing.   Each white paper must stand on its own merit.  The HEL JTO will use only information provided in a white paper in the evaluation process leading to an oral presentation and award.  Prepare the white paper simply, economically, in accordance with all instructions contained herein, and in any external sources referenced herein.  Convey all required information concisely using straightforward language.  The cost of preparing white papers and oral presentations in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract; but the Government may allow ordinary bid and proposal indirect costs in accordance with FAR 31.205-18.  For the purposes of this solicitation, a white paper shall consist of four parts: 1) a technical section; 2) a ROM cost; 3) a schedule; and 4) resumes. The four components of each white paper shall be recorded on a single CD-R.  The HEL JTO requires no hardcopies. Submit all files in Microsoft Word 6.0 or higher format.  Record all files on the CD-R as distinct documents and properly name.  The typical submission will be a CD-R containing a technical  section in Word format; a ROM cost in Word format; and a schedule in Microsoft Project; and a resume section in Work format. Label a single CD-R containing these files with the lead offeror’s name, project title (to correspond exactly to the project title used on the coversheets of each proposal component and technical area number), and contact information.  Mail or hand-carry the labeled CD-R to the OSD/HEL JTO such that it is received NLT 1600 (Mountain Time) 3 October 2003.  JTO requires no formal transmittal letter. OSD/HEL JTO, Attn:  FY04 BAA Submission I, 901 University Blvd. SE, Suite 100, Albuquerque, NM 87106. The HEL JTO will not evaluate or consider for award white papers sent to any other address or submitted by fax or e-mail.  The HEL  JTO will not accept classified white papers, but offerors must submit a white paper for eligibility for award. A white paper containing data that is not to be disclosed to the public for any purpose or used by the government except for evaluation purposes shall include on its cover page the statement found in paragraph b, chapter 3 (page 6) of the AFRL BAA/PRDA Industry Guide http://www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract/Ind-gde.rtf. Additionally, mark each page containing proprietary or export-controlled data as described also on page 6 of the AFRL BAA/PRDA Industry Guide.  This marking may be in a small font and shall be at the bottom only of each applicable page. Limit the technical and management section to three (3) pages. This page limitation applies to all information comprising the technical/management section except the required cover page, cost, schedule and resumes.  The Government desires no extraneous information (information not explicitly requested in this announcement); do not submit it.   The Government will only read and evaluate the technical section up to the page limitation. The Government will delete pages over the page limitation prior to evaluation.  Allow one-inch margins on each page.  Use elite type size or equivalent (not smaller than 10 point vertical character height and not more than 12 characters per inch).  A 10 point proportional serif font is acceptable, in which case a character per inch measurement does not apply.  Do not typeset or use other techniques to reduce character size or spacing. Each printed side of a sheet counts as a page. With the exception of the page limitation, these format specifications shall apply to the offeror’s SOW. The Government will accomplish evaluation of white papers through a technical peer review of each white paper using the criteria below.  The Government will use no further evaluation criteria to assess the papers.  Organization and clarity of information are critical to all of these evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific/technical merit and soundness of approach of the proposed effort, and its significance to DoD HEL S&T shortfall(s). (2) The innovativeness of the idea(s), approach(es), or procedure(s) proposed, and the balance relative to overall technical and cost/schedule risk.  (3) The offeror’s capabilities including experience, facilities, competence/availability of personnel, and the cost/price of the proposed effort. Find recommended templates for the technical/management section in attachment two, and cost proposal instructions in attachment three. Regardless how the offeror chooses to prepare the white paper, all white papers shall contain the information requested found in attachments and elsewhere herein. The Government encourages open communication between offerors and technical points of contact until submittal of oral briefing charts or cost proposals. Don Seeley, 505.248.8205, serves as the technical point of contact. Thereafter, only the Government should initiate communication for clarification or to notify offerors of time and date for oral presentation.

Order will be placed on or before October 29, 2003. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions. Therefore the initial offer must contain and meet all the Government specifications and requirements. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines discussions are necessary.

<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Department of the Army, Defense Contracting Command-Washington (DCC-W), 5200 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310-5200 intends to award a contract under full and open competition for a source  of Assessment of the Financial Impact and Implications of Critical Defense Industry Supplier Relationships.  The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Industrial Policy (DUSD(IP)), Industrial Base Transformation Directorate (IBT) is the anal ytical focal point for industrial base competitiveness and financial health issues of interest to the Department of Defense (DoD).  A primary responsibility of IBT is to participate in DoD policy development and decisions regarding mergers, acquisitions, a nd other corporate relationships between defense suppliers, particularly as they have substantial impact on the overall structure, competition and technological innovation of the defense industry at all levels of the supply chain.  OBJECTIVE: 	The overall objective of the task is to characterize the financial dimensions of select corporate mergers and acquisitions within the defense industry and assist the staff of the ODUSD(IP) in the development of assessments of the subject transactions. TASK DESCRIPTION: The contractor shall: Analyze the financial impact of six (6) selected corporate transactions (identified by ODUSD(IP)), as they arise throughout the period of performance of the contract.   Provide substantive input into development of IP briefings (graphics, charts, sensitivi ty analyses, etc.)   Address both the financial health of the target firm as an ongoing concern, and the effect of the acquisition on the financial condition of the buyer, specifically answering the questions: Ã‚Â·   Can the buyer afford the acquisition without negative impact on ongoing operations, such as its ability to sustain necessary research and development for future innovation and competitiveness?   Ã‚Â·    Is the target firm a financially viable stand-alone enterprise going forward?   Analytical treatments should include analysis of impact on cash position relative to debt service and effect on forward earnings per share.  Analyses should include high, low and neutral projections over a 3-5 year period with comparative assessment relati ve to industry benchmarks, where possible.  Sensitivity analysis should be performed around the variables of purchase price and deal composition in addition to performance expectations.   STUDY DELIVERABLES AND DURATION: For each transaction, the Contractor shall provide annotated briefing charts summarizing their analysis, within 2 weeks of notification, unless otherwise directed.  In some cases, additional financial analysis may be required of larger complex cases, resul ting in a larger annotated briefing.  After submission of the base briefing report of findings, some tailoring of analysis and data rendering may be required to support development of IP briefings for senior DoD officials. BILLING: The contract shall bill the government as appropriate or necessary for partial performance of tasks described herein.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Period of performance for each individual transaction is as stated aboveÃ¢Â€Â”2 weeks from time of notification to initial report of findings, with follow-on analysis and briefing support as needed.  Period of performance of the contract shall be one (1) y ear from the time of contract award with 4 12-month options. LEVEL OF EFFORT: Based on a simila r past efforts, it is anticipated that a 20-25 person-days per transaction will be required, unless modified by the Contracting Officer.  SECURITY: The effort shall be at the unclassified level.  Handling of business sensitive/proprietary data will likely be required.  As such, to be considered qualified, contractors must first demonstrate they have relevant experience and past performance accomplishing sophisticated financial analyses in the context of mergers and acquisitions.  Contractors must show that key personnel  have sufficient credentials, to include education and experience specific to financial analysis and the defense industry, respectively.  Further, contractors must show a track record of performance on similar tasks and show no conflict of interest that co uld compromise objectivity.  Finally, since the work will involve working closely with OSD staff, often with very tight timelines to complete analysis for integration into broader assessments, the contractor must demonstrate a capacity to handle multiple a nd simultaneous analyses, with start-to-finish durations of 2 weeks or less.   Period of performance for each individual transaction is as stated aboveÃ¢Â€Â”2 weeks from time of notification to initial report of findings, with follow-on analysis and briefi ng support as needed.  Period of performance of the contract shall be one (1) year from the time of contract award with 4 12-month options. The contract will be on a time and materials basis.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1.	Understanding and Compliance with requirements. The proposal will address each task area in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the Statement of Work (SOW).  Evaluation:  Does the proposal address each specific analytical requirement set forth in the SOW?  To what extent does the proposal demonstrate a firm understanding of the requirements set forth in the SOW?   2. Soundness of Approach. The proposal will clearly indicate how the offeror plans to accomplish the tasks as defined in the SOW, including (but not limited to) creativity and clarity of methodology, and quality of data sources.  Additionally, the proposal should provide evidence o f sufficient planning to show that work can be, and will be accomplished as required, and on schedule. Evaluation:  Does the proposal include a complete plan to accomplish each requirement, including subcontracting, if any?  To what extent does the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s plan demonstrate that appropriate personnel will be available employed efficiently to carry out  the requirements?  Is the proposed analytical methodology clearly and effectively answer questions in the task statement?  Are data sources proposed s ound, viable and accessible? 3. Past Performance/Relevant Experience. The proposal will provide data on the past performance in specific contracts and work of this type, and provide information concerning performance of these contracts, particularly as it relates to the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s overall abilities.  The offeror should i nclude both relevant government and private sector work, if releasable.  If the offeror has past performance with government antitrust and/or technology security reviews, it should so state, and describe the nature and extent of the experience. Evaluation:  The evaluation will consider the level of past performance in terms of the number of years and its relevance to the tasks listed in the SOW.  Past performance will be evaluated considering its quality based on the materials furnished for evalu ation.  For work used to show relevant, provide a contract number, government point of contact with address and phone number, and period of performance. 4. Key Personnel.

Evaluation:  The proposed key personnel will be evaluated to the extent that their education and experience clearly demonstrate qualifications sufficient to fully perform the tasks listed in the SOW.  5.  Price - Although price is a substantial consideration it is less important that technical/personnel/oral presentation.   (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly un balanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the of fer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of clause) 52.217-9     OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 60 months. (End of clause)

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes being requested & a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a request for quotation.  Submit offers on RML-RFQ-3049.  Solicitation documents and incorporated provisions & clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15 dated 8/25/03.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325414 & the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE: Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP) has a need to sequence to 10X coverage a Mycobacterium Tuberculosis genome and to sequence to 7X coverage a Streptococcus Pyogenes genome, involving the following three steps: One(1) Library construction, Two(2) 10X and 7X shotgun sequencing, and Three(3) Two(2) rounds of finishing (primer design, synthesis, and sequencing) for each genome. The Contractor shall accomplish 7X and 10X sequence coverage of two bacterial genomes.  Personnel suggested by the Contractor will be approved in advance by the RML Project Officer.  This is an eight(8) to ten(10) month work effort, where the final product will be the production of two(2) genomes, at 7X and 10X coverage, with two(2) rounds of finishing performed on each.  The trace files must be compatible, transferable to, and readable by RML bioinformatics software and RML computing systems and infrastructure, which involves a Finch, and ERGO server.  RML systems are PC, MAC and Unix/Linus-based. The contractor  shall keep all NIH, RML-derived data secure and will not release, make public or maintain any of the data beyond this contract effort. If  Internet connectivity is needed in order to perform the work, for transfer of files, or other efforts, contractor computers will be secure and in compliance with RML-IT security procedures and policies. Contractor-supplied software shall be kept current and up-to-date with applicable security patches and upgrades.  Internet connectivity and/or remote access for the purpose of performing the work, for transfer of files, or other efforts, will be coordinated with NIAID IT staff to ensure security and compliance with NIAID IT procedures and policies, including Section 508 Accessibility Standards. The Contractor shall provide the following three(3) steps: (1) Library construction. The MTB genome is estimated to be approximately ~4.4 MB in size (4,411,529 base pairs for strain H37Rv). The Streptococcus genome is estimated to be approximately 2.0MB in size. The LHBP will send to the contractor purified total genomic DNA for these two(2) strains. The contractor shall use this DNA to construct a library using the plasmid vector pGEM-3Z. DNA shall be fragmented using a computer controlled shearing device to achieve an average DNA fragment size of 2 kb.  The fragments shall be treated with T4 polymerase followed by Klenow fragment before ligation into the plasmid vector.  Ninety percent or greater cloning success of 2kb fragment representation in the clones shall be achieved. Progressive assemblies of the incoming data shall begin after the first 1,000 clones from the library have been sequenced.  This shall be done to detect any problems in library construction or contamination from other organisms/vectors.  The assembly dynamics shall be carefully compared with models generated on both real data and computer simulations.  These tests can reveal irregularities at many levels of the process, especially those involving library insert size distribution.  (2) 10X shotgun sequencing/preliminary annotation/comparison. Transformed colonies shall first be grown in petri trays and picked by a robotic colony picker. Once colonies are picked, each clone must receive an individual name that must reflect the organism, the type of the library, the cloning attempt, the ID of the 96- well plate and it’s relative position in the plate. Cultures shall be processed for DNA mini-preps using robots for plasmid extraction and purification steps.  96 well plates with purified plasmid DNAs must be stored in dedicated, specific freezers at -20 Celsius.  DNA samples shall be transferred to 384 well plates for performing sequencing reactions. IDs of the 96- well plates must transfer to the 384-well format for tracking. Sequencing reactions shall be performed using the ET MegaBACE Dye Terminator Kit.  Ethanol precipitation may be used for PCR clean-up. Sequencing reactions may be loaded onto MegaBACE 1000 DNA sequencers or #3700 DNA sequencers.  Samples shall be sequenced from both ends using standard forward and reverse, vector-specific primers for both plasmid libraries.  Passing sequence reactions shall be those at 450 bases of average Q19-20 level or higher.  A minimum of approximately 98,000 sequencing reactions at average 450 bases length or higher, and average Q19-20 quality or higher, shall be performed for the MTB genome. A minimum of approximately 32,000 sequencing reactions at average 450 bases length or higher, and average Q19-20 quality or higher, shall be performed for the Strept. genome. No more than 98,000 or 32,000 sequencing reactions for each genome may be performed without written approval by the project officer.  Following 10X shotgun sequencing of a genome the assembly should produce between 200 and 300 contigs or gaps per genome. The contractor shall compute, based on the assembled sequences and by summing the sizes of the contigs,  a better estimate of the genome sizes.  The contractor shall do any extra runs needed to bring the average coverage to 10X. Actual payment shall reflect the original runs plus any extra runs made to bring the coverage to 10X.  If the original runs indicate a smaller number of runs would have been adequate to achieve 10X coverage, LHBP will pay for the actual runs done. LHBP recognizes that genome size is an unknown and may vary per strain. If the total number of runs brings the coverage to slightly greater than 10X, this extra coverage will be useful to LHBP.  Primary assembly of the individual sequences shall be performed using the Phred/Cross_match/Phrap package originally developed at Washington University.  These algorithms automatically base call the trace data, screen out vector sequence, remove poor data, and assemble individual reads into contigs.  The contractor shall have additional in-house tools to help in the preparation of the data for assemblies, to modify the assembler parameters, assembler output, to add and remove data from the assembly and to compare different or sequential assembly runs.  The assembly dynamics shall be monitored and compared with models generated on both real data and computer simulations to reveal potential problems associated with the assembly conditions. The integrity of the assemblies shall be checked using either in-house or commercial tools, to detect potential errors and ambiguities in contigs. The contractor shall be able to adjust assembly conditions and perform manual editing to correct some of these types of problems. 10X sequencing reads and assemblies shall be delivered and must be compatible with our Finch server.  (3)  Two rounds of genome finishing.  Two(2)  rounds of primer design and synthesis for use in sequence walking reactions using the plasmid library shall be performed using Consed/AutoFinish editing software. Various amounts of manual checking and correction may be required, depending on genome-specific factors (GC%), repeat composition, library construction, etc. Additional sequencing in the two rounds of finishing shall be used to raise quality levels for problem regions and to join contigs. Deliverables:
The contractor shall provide to the RML Project Officer contact information for the Project Manager that will oversee the genomes.  The contractor's Project Manager, shall provide to the RML Project Officer, weekly status/progress reports regarding the progress of each genome project from the receiving of the DNA to the second and last genome finishing step. The reports shall describe progress achieved, problems encountered, sequencing results,  strategies intended to deal with problems that arise, and immediate future efforts.  Reports may be filed by email.  The Contractor shall produce/provide the following deliverables for Step 1:  One (1) plasmid library per genome with >90% clones containing insertion fragments averaging 2kb in size.  The duration of step one(1) shall not exceed three (3) weeks from the time of receiving genomic DNA for each genome.  The Contractor shall produce/provide the following deliverables for Step 2:  Sequencing reactions must average 450 bases in length at average Q19-Q20. Approximately 98,000 sequencing reactions for the MTB genome, or that number of reads needed to reach the 10X sequencing coverage level. Approximately 32,000 sequencing reactions for the Strept. genome, or that number of reads needed to reach the 10X sequencing coverage level. The trace data shall be in SCF format and shall be posted on the contractor's secure server available for FTP download.  The trace data shall be readable by any standard sequence editing software.  The contig sequence data shall be convertable to FASTA format and can be posted on the secure server for FTP download, if requested by RML.  Purified plasmid DNA of sequenced clones obtained during the project shall be stored in dedicated freezers at the contractor's site. All plasmid DNA should be ready for shipment to RML in 96-well format on dry ice within 24 hrs of notice of request for those DNAs.  If  LHBP wants the purified DNA, the LHBP will pay for shipping and handling costs.  Following 10X or 7X shotgun sequencing of a genome, the assembly, which should produce between 200 and 300 contigs or gaps per genome shall be converted to a flat file format (FASTA) and shall be delivered to RML on a CD within 5-10 days of assembly completion. The duration of Step two(2) is not to exceed three (3) months from the  time of completion of Step one(1), for each genome.  The Project Manager shall provide Status/progress report to the RML Project Officer on a weekly basis by e-mail.  The Contractor will produce/provide the following deliverables for Step 3:  The trace data for all primer-walking/finishing reactions, which shall be in SCF format, shall be posted on the contractor's secure server available for FTP download.

DFAR 252.204-7004, (NOV 2001), Required Central Contractor Registration,  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause   (1) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary DOD repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DOD. (2) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) Data Universal Numbering System +4 (Duns+4) number means the Duns number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern. This 4 digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying subunits or affiliates of the parent business concern. (4) Registered in the CCR database means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the Duns +4 number, if applicable, and the corresponding Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number and the CAGE code have been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed. (b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. (2) The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS +4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (3) Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. (4) DOD has established a goal of registering an applicant in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet. However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days. Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (c) The contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete. (d) Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov. 
This solicitation is only open to all small business concerns within the Norfolk commuting area.  This area known as Tidewater / Hampton Roads is defined as extending as far north as Williamsburg, as far south as the Chesapeake-North Carolina border, as far west as Suffolk, and is bordered on the east by the Atlantic ocean, Chesapeake Bay, and York River.  This solicitation geographical limitation is essential for limiting possible financial impacts upon the Contractor and the Government; due to the need for Ship / Contractor pre-performance conferences and due to unforeseeable ship schedule changes during contract performance.  Offerors’ geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   Offerors may schedule an opportunity to scope the task through direct contact with the ship or activity without contacting the Contracting Officer.  Visitations shall be at contractor’s own expense and no pre-paid open-and-inspection costs are authorized.  POC:  SKC Pamela Nelson pamelan@roosevelt.navy.mil

DFAR 252.204-7004, (NOV 2001), Required Central Contractor Registration,  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause   (1) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary DOD repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DOD. (2) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) Data Universal Numbering System +4 (Duns+4) number means the Duns number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern. This 4 digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying subunits or affiliates of the parent business concern. (4) Registered in the CCR database means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the Duns +4 number, if applicable, and the corresponding Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number and the CAGE code have been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed. (b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. (2) The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS +4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (3) Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. (4) DOD has established a goal of registering an applicant in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet. However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days. Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (c) The contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete. (d) Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.
This solicitation is only open to all small business concerns within the Norfolk commuting area.  This area known as Tidewater / Hampton Roads is defined as extending as far north as Williamsburg, as far south as the Chesapeake-North Carolina border, as far west as Suffolk, and is bordered on the east by the Atlantic ocean, Chesapeake Bay, and York River.  This solicitation geographical limitation is essential for limiting possible financial impacts upon the Contractor and the Government; due to the need for Ship / Contractor pre-performance conferences and due to unforeseeable ship schedule changes during contract performance.  Offerors’ geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   Offerors may schedule an opportunity to scope the task through direct contact with the ship or activity without contacting the Contracting Officer.  Visitations shall be at contractor’s own expense and no pre-paid open-and-inspection costs are authorized.  POC:  SKC Pamela Nelson pamelan@roosevelt.navy.mil
