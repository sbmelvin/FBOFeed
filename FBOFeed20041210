<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for an anticipated three year cost plus fixed-fee award with two one year option periods.  This effort that is to be evaluated based on “Best Value” is a USAID/Colombia, Agriculture and Alternative Development Office, Areas for Municipal-level Alternative Development (ADAM) Program.  The ceiling level of  USAID funding for the anticipated five year term of this effort is currently being determined and will depend on availability of funding.

The Government of Colombia (GOC) has undertaken an integrated effort that has substantially driven the illegal armed groups out of the more populated parts of Colombia, and has extended at least a minimal level of state presence into every municipality, perhaps for the first time in history.  The National Development Plan implemented by President Uribe’s administration aims to consolidate state presence in all municipalities in the country.  The three main objectives of the Plan are to: 1) provide democratic security; 2) improve public administration; and 3) promote social and economic reactivation.  However, an integrated program is needed to consolidate this state presence and create economic opportunities in key rural municipalities, in order to assure that this progress is sustainable. 

The challenge now is to determine the most cost effective way to expand this initiative to achieve the Mission goal of sustainable reduction in the production of illicit drugs and the promotion of peace in Colombia.  While area planted has been reduced dramatically in some zones, it has expanded in others.  In addition, coca crops have shifted from large scale production in extensive areas to small production units co-located in more populous areas with traditional crops, and into protected national park land.  Aerial spraying of herbicides has had the greatest impact on eradication, both in terms of direct eradication and of encouraging farmers to seek alternative development assistance.  However, upfront voluntary eradication techniques (but not utilizing USAID resources) are also a key tool in the campaign to suppress illicit crops, particularly as production shifts from large-scale monoculture to smaller scale plantings interspersed with legitimate crops.

USAID’s strategy is now to work within groups of contiguous municipalities, some of which have illicit crops and some do not.  The emphasis will be on creating sustainable economic activities throughout the groups of municipalities, at the same time that efforts are undertaken to eradicate illicit crops within the area.  By emphasizing promotion of licit crops and economic activities throughout the area, the program will discourage a simple shift of production location as eradication progresses. 

Similarly, USAID/Colombia has made a major investment in improving municipal government capacity and performance in selected municipalities in Colombia as part of an integrated approach to reduce illicit crop production.  These activities have supported the following components:  municipal management; development planning; public services; finance and revenue; public information; public policy; and the social infrastructure fund (SIF) projects.  The activities have placed emphasis on training of mayor’s, the municipality’s staff, the community and municipal council members.  

USAID’s strategy, as will be described further below, is to approach the strengthening of municipal governments and the creation of economic opportunities among groups of contiguous municipalities in an integrated manner, in order to support eradication of illicit crops and prevent their spread or relocation.  In addition, this integrated approach will allow more effective linkage to activities supporting internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other vulnerable groups.  And promotion of licit crop activities will be coordinated with private sector-led investment initiatives, and assistance to the specialty coffee sector, to be assisted under separate USAID supported activities.  Finally, these initiatives will also link to USAID investments to improve the administration and access to justice, protection of human rights, and efforts to reduce corruption.

USAID’s strategy is also aligned with the GOC’s International Cooperation strategy which aims to strengthen the international coalition already working for peace in Colombia; the strengthening of both the State and civil society; and working towards the solution of the structural problems that the country is facing.   

The principal constraints to a more effective alternative development program at the municipal level can be summarized as:

-	Insecurity caused by continued violent activity of illegal armed groups, despite        
-	increased initiatives by the Colombian armed forces.
-	Need to focus efforts on zones with demonstrated economic potential in order to develop sustainable, licit economic activities.  There is limited knowledge among producers of production technology and marketing channels for more profitable licit crops and other economic activities.  
-	Weak municipal governments that fail to provide needed services, so that citizens feel isolated from the State.  
-	Local authorities and community leaders need to take a more proactive stance in discouraging production of illicit crops.
-	Poor economic infrastructure, due to ineffective municipal services, which discourages investment and economic activity.
-	Effective partnerships between private sector investors and producers in the target regions are needed in order to assure long term viability of economic activities.

USAID/Colombia has decided to combine the alternative development and local government strengthening programs into a single, integrated activity, to be implemented by a single contractor (with sub-contractors, as needed) or consortium of firms.  The Mission’s intention is that these previous efforts now be fully integrated under a single contract mechanism, rather than managed as separate activities.  

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541990.  The RFP may be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPPS) web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 5.102, Availability of Solicitations, Paragraph (d), “AVAILABILITY OF THE RFP IS LIMITED TO THIS ELECTRONIC MEDIUM ONLY”.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of diode high-energy laser system architectures.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  

DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of diode high-energy laser system architectures.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, materials, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.  

The Architecture for Diode High Energy Laser Systems (ADHELS) program aims to generate high power, high brightness laser beams of military interest by combining the beams of high power, high efficiency laser diodes/arrays/stacks.  Such laser system architectures may lead to 100-kilowatt-class laser beam power with near-diffraction-limited beam propagation characteristics at laser wavelengths corresponding to efficient atmospheric transmission.  The combined, high power beam could then be projected to a distant target with a suitable beam director to meet mission objectives. 

AREAS OF INTEREST

Technical Area One: Architecture for Diode High Energy Laser Systems. A Laser Performance Metric, LPM, has been developed to characterize the performance of these beam-combined laser diode systems. This Laser Performance Metric is defined as being equal to the product of the diode electrical-to-optical efficiency, DE, times the beam combining efficiency, BCE, times the beam propagation factor, BPF.  The Diode Efficiency is defined as the total laser optical output power from all the diodes divided by the electrical power used to drive the diodes. The Beam Combining Efficiency is defined as the combined laser beam optical power radiated from the defining near-field exit aperture of the laser system divided by the total laser optical output power from all the diodes. The Beam Propagation Factor is a measure of the beam quality and is defined as the laser optical output power in a specified far-field bucket divided by the total optical output power radiating from the defining near-field exit aperture of the combined laser beam. The far field bucket is defined for the ADHELS program as 1.44 times the diffraction-limited spot area.  The diffraction-limited spot area is equal to (pi / 4) times the square of (the diffraction-limited angle times f), where the diffraction limited angle equals 2.44 times the laser center wavelength divided by  the defining exit aperture of the combined laser beam.   f is the focal length of the optic used to form the far field spot. A desirable set of individual parameter values might be: Diode Efficiency = 60%, Beam Combining Efficiency = 80% and Beam Propagation Factor = 50%, resulting in an LPM of 0.24.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 05-09 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Architecture for Diode High Energy Laser Systems program will consist of a Phase I (approximately 18 months) followed by a Phase II (approximately 18 months) for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD.  Awards are expected to be made during the second half of calendar year 2005.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II should include it as an option in their proposal.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site (http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams) has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POCs for this effort are C. Martin Stickley, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail:  BAA05-09@darpa.mil, and Joe Mangano, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail:  BAA05-09@darpa.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- MEMS Exchange (MX)
<SOLNBR>BAA05-12
<RESPDATE>020805
<ARCHDATE>12102005
<CONTACT>Clark Nguyen, Program Manager, MTO, Phone 5712184586, Fax 7036962206, Email cnguyen@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of MEMS Exchange (MX).  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.

DARPA is soliciting innovative proposals in the area of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) microfabrication process run submissions and process module additions to the MEMS Exchange distributed fabrication network, with the intention of furthering the MEMS Exchange (MX) program goal of providing flexible access to complex MEMS fabrication technology in a wide variety of materials and to a broad multi-disciplinary user base, pursuant to making possible novel devices otherwise unattainable via inflexible foundries. In the area of process run submissions for MEMS devices, submissions that utilize the MEMS Exchange for all steps, from start to finish, except perhaps a final release step, are of most interest. In the area of process module additions, complete, self-contained, multi-mask process modules that can serve as "standard" processes are of most interest. However, single process steps (e.g., a film deposition, an etch capability) will still be considered if exceptionally novel and compelling. Emphasis will be given to multi-mask process modules that are amenable to combination with other modules to yield fully integrated microsystems. Among the relevant set of process module technologies deemed beneficial to the MEMS Exchange service are: (1) generic, widely-applicable, standard processes--e.g., surface-micromachining, SOI-micromachining, metal micromachining, etc.--that yield fully functional MEMS devices; (2) process technologies that yield 3-dimensional structures; and (3) generally applicable technologies capable of packaging MEMS devices under environments suitable for optimum performance. Given that one of the main objectives of the MEMS Exchange program is to insure self-sustained operation of the MEMS Exchange service beyond the end of the program, additional consideration will likely be given to process modules perceived to be in highest demand or capable of satisfying a crucial need by any of the DARPA MEMS programs.

A primary driver behind the interest in process run submissions is to assess the potential advantages of a distributed fabrication network over present-day self-contained foundries, namely:

(1)	the ability to achieve otherwise unattainable devices with revolutionary performance enhancements by making available to all users the widest array of process steps, including and especially exotic process capabilities previously usable by only those at isolated fabrication sites;
(2)	the ability to circumvent delays due to equipment failure by harnessing multiple equipment redundancies across the fabrication site network, allowing MEMS Exchange to merely route around equipment problems;
(3)	the ability to raise the probability of first run success using MEMS Exchange's online automated process design-rule checking software; and
(4)	better communication with users via MEMS Exchange's web-based user interface.

Microfabrication process run submissions that utilize the MEMS Exchange for all steps, from start to finish, towards a complete, functional device, are most likely to exercise all of the above aspects of MEMS Exchange, and are thus of most interest.

Another driver behind the interest in process run submissions, and behind the interest in self-contained, multi-mask process modules, is to see if a "standard" MEMS process flow can be identified that is general enough to be used by the majority of MEMS designers in a given class, yet still capable of attaining performance on par with or approaching that of a fully custom process. Such a "universal" MEMS process (or a set of them, one for each "class"), if even possible, would be highly beneficial to the MEMS community, since its ability to support a large number of products could substantially raise the volume of wafers processed per month, thereby greatly lowering the cost of the process, and thus, of the products it services. In essence, such a process might allow the MEMS industry to enjoy the same standardization advantages that the extremely high volume integrated circuit industry presently enjoys. 

MEMS devices that harness the material and process flexibility provided by the MEMS Exchange distributed fabrication network are expected to enable a myriad of strategic capabilities. In particular, MEMS technology, with its ability to reduce both size and power consumption in a myriad of sensor, communication, actuation, and information processing devices, has been identified as a key enabling technology for military platforms in all areas. Among the many examples of high payoff applications of MEMS technologies are micromechanical logic circuits for munitions safe-and-arming devices, micromechanical vibrating resonators for frequency selection and generation in miniaturized communication transceivers, micromechanical separation analyzers for chemical gas and bio-agent analysis and detection, movable micromirrors for optical switching and scanning, micro fuel cells and engines for portable, long-lasting power generation, and chip-scale atomic clocks for portable GPS and ultra-secure communications. The most recent advancements in MEMS technology have invariably required participation from researchers from a widely diverse set of backgrounds, many of whom do not have access to the full spectrum of MEMS technologies.  In allowing and encouraging the use of a wide variety of materials and fabrication processes by a broad multi-disciplinary user base, the development and enhancement of the MEMS Exchange should prove instrumental in providing the accessibility to MEMS technology required for a myriad of present and future MEMS-enabled devices for military platforms. In addition, MEMS Exchange can serve as a much-needed fabrication infrastructure for low or medium volume production of MEMS-enabled products for DoD applications.

DARPA strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities that take into consideration all significant and relevant engineering tradeoffs and optimizations. Teaming among academic, industrial and/or government partners is encouraged, and it is anticipated that the contributions of the team members are complementary as well as essential to the critical path of the research plan. Such teaming, however, is not required, and offerings from compelling individual efforts will be given the same consideration as that for teams. A technology insertion plan is encouraged and research that holds promise of insertion into Department of Defense (DoD) relevance is of great interest.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 05-12 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

This addition to the MEMS Exchange program is meant to support short-term efforts, on the order of one year or less, that should culminate in either finished devices with statistical data gauging the effectiveness of the MEMS Exchange service; or in the insertion of new process modules into the MEMS Exchange service that greatly enhance its overall capability and increase its user base. Multiple awards in amounts consistent with MEMS Exchange pricing for the Process Run Submission Area of Interest; and not to exceed $200,000 for the Process Module Insertion Area of Interest; and all totaling on the order of $2 million, are expected to be made during the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. Note that funds devoted to the Process Run Submission Area of Interest are intended to cover mainly the cost of fabrication by the MEMS Exchange, and not costs associated with the design or development of any given device. A web site--http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-05-12/ has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.

<DESC>The TSA's Security Technology Deployment Office (STDO) is responsible for procuring and deploying technology to support the safety and security of the movement of people and baggage throughout the nation’s airports. STDO is responsible for ensuring that Explosive Trace Detection (ETD) systems and technologies provide airport level security benefits. STDO is planning for the modernization of the current ETD system which will support both legacy and new functional capabilities.

This announcement is being conducted to select qualified technical sources that can compete for a contract to manufacture and deploy state of the art ETD systems.  This contract shall also have options for Training Tasks and Engineering Services on an as-ordered basis by the Government. Projected award of a contract is anticipated by June 2005, with a period of performance from the date of award for a minimum of one (1) year and a maximum of five (5) years inclusive of all options. The Government requires unlimited rights to all data and computer software produced under this contract in accordance with the acquisition method being used.  
In order to make a determination of qualified bidders, the TSA requires the following qualification information from interested sources:

1.  A one-page Notice of Interest delivered to Ms. Patricia Newton by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) December 23, 2004.  The notice of interest shall identify the Offeror’s proposed ETD equipment for the forthcoming ETD manufacture and deployment RFP.  Offerors shall identify the make, model and country of manufacture for each ETD equipment proposed for TSA consideration. 

2.  Transportation Security Lab (TSL) Certification:  Offeror must submit, at no cost to the Government, a Production Sample Machine(s) to the TSL to be used as the test system for Certification.  During the Certification testing, the Offeror must provide testing support at no cost to the Government.  Offerors, who comply with the Notice of Interest submission requirements, will be notified of the certification testing schedule and Production Sample Machine delivery dates.  Failure to deliver the Production Sample Machine(s) by the delivery date may result in a non-responsive determination by the Contracting Officer and remove the Offeror from further consideration for this procurement.  It is anticipated that Certification testing will be conducted in January 2005.    

3.  Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE):  Offeror must provide, at no cost to the Government, five (5) production machines for an OUE upon successful completion of Certification testing.  Offerors will be notified as to their exact OUE testing schedule.  During the OUE, the offeror must provide testing support at no cost to the Government.  The OUE period of performance is anticipated to last 3 months.  Failure to provide equipment and/or support for OUE may result in a non-responsive determination by the Contracting Officer and remove the Offeror from further consideration for this procurement.

Only qualified sources will be permitted to submit an ETD proposal.  After all testing is completed, a Qualified Vendor’s List (QVL) will be established.  Only those Offerors who appear on the QVL will receive a Request for Proposal (RFP) providing the opportunity to compete for an ETD production, training and engineering services contract. The Government reserves the right to open up the QVL again, at the convenience of the Government.  Interested parties responding to this announcement letter should carefully consider if they have all the expertise required to meet the Government's expected tasking. The purpose of the evaluation is to identify those Offerors that have the expertise, interest, and capabilities to perform these tasks.  Cost information is not requested at this time.

This announcement is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This announcement does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) plans to release a notification of intent to issue an invitation for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) concerning its plan to develop the NATO-Russia Council Theatre Missile Defense Systems Interoperability Project, Phase IIb.

This project is funded through individual contributions by the Nations participating in the NATO-Russia Counsel (NRC).  The principles of the procurement procedures for the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP) will also apply for this planned procurement.  Even though this is not an NSIP funded project, the nomination of potential bidders by the National Delegations will be the same as if it were an NSIP funded project.  However, bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 6 months from closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a bid guarantee of EUR 60,000.  But should the selection and award procedure exceed the 6 month estimate, firms will be requested to voluntarily extend the validity of their bids and bid guarantee accordingly.  Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid and excuse themselves from the bidding process without penalty.

National authorities are advised that the technical requirements applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents are NATO-RUSSIA UNCLASSIFIED.  Information from earlier stages of the project will be provided to the bidders upon request.  This information is classified up to NATO-RUSSIA SECRET.  Prospective bidders must have (or be able to obtain) an overall personnel security and facility clearance of NATO SECRET at the time of Invitation for Bid (IFB) release in order to be eligible to receive bidding information.

ALL FIRMS INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROCUREMENT MUST BE CERTIFIED AND NOMINATED BY THEIR NATIONAL DELEGATIONS WITH THE REQUIRED DECLARATION OF ELIGIBILITY.     REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPATION RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM FIRMS CAN NOT BE CONSIDERED.     The deadline for interested and qualified firms to be certified and nominated to the bidder list is 15 December 2004.  YOUR FIRM MUST BE CERTIFIED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE BID MATERIALS FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.     THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DOES NOT SERVE AS THE CONTRACTING AGENCY FOR NATO PROJECTS.     NC3A IS THE CONTRACTING ENTITY.     It is anticipated that the Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued 19 December 2004 with the closing date for receipt of bids scheduled for 19 February 2005.  Only firms the U.S. Department of Commerce has declared eligible and has nominated to the bidders list by the 15 December 2004 deadline will be allowed to bid.

Agency Name  - Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) 1333 Isaac Hull Ave SE Washington, DC 20376 2.  Research Opportunity Title - Advanced Research and Development in Naval Integrated Power Systems 3.  Response Date - This announcement will remain open for approximately one year from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA.  White Papers may be submitted any time during this period. 4.  Research Opportunity Description -  The Naval Sea Systems Command is interested in White Papers for long and short-term Research and Development (R&D) projects that offer potential for advancement and improvements in the implementation of shipboard Integrated Power Systems (IPS) at the major component and system level.  IPS provides total ship electric power including electric propulsion, power conversion and distribution, combat system support and mission load interfaces to the electric power system.  IPS supports multiple ship class applications for future surface ships, with DD (X), DD (X) spiral development, and CG (X) being the primary ship application targets in the near term.  IPS leverages investments in technologies that will be useable by both military and commercial sectors.  The basic defining feature of IPS is the production of electric power for ship propulsion and ship service requirements from common prime movers.   The flexibility of electric power transmission allows power-generating modules with various power ratings to be connected to propulsion loads and ship service in any arrangement that supports the ship's mission at lowest overall cost.  Systems engineering in IPS is focused on increasing the commonality of components used across ship types and in developing modules that will be integral to standardization, zonal system architectures, and generic shipbuilding strategies.  The purpose of increased commonality is to reduce the total cost of ship ownership by using common modules composed of standard components and/or standard interfaces. IPS addresses ship platform program goals through: reduced ship acquisition cost through integration of propulsion and ship's service prime movers; lower ship operational costs resulting from more flexible operating characteristics and more efficient components; reduced ship construction costs by allowing more extensive modular construction of power generation, distribution, and loads; improved ship survivability and reduced vulnerability through increased arrangement flexibility and improved electrical system survivability; reduced manning through improved power management systems and reduced on-board maintenance requirements; improved ship signature characteristics; improved design adaptability to meet future requirements of multiple ship types or missions; integrating power management and protection by fully utilizing the power electronics in the system to perform fault protection as well as power conversion and load  management functions; simplified technology insertion;!  and, reduced machinery system acquisition costs through utilization of commercially shared technologies and components. NAVSEA wishes to continue to improve IPS by performing analysis, modeling and simulation, life cycle cost analysis, producibility studies, module development, ship integration, architecture design, ship electric architectures and high power weapons systems requirements, and related efforts.  An evaluation of emerging technologies for ship applications (such as fuel cells, high-energy weapons, high power radars, high-speed generators, and advanced power electronics) to determine future feasibility and development requirements will be conducted. The areas of focus for White Papers and Proposals submitted in response to this BAA should include, but are not limited to, the analysis, development, risk reduction and demonstration of future shipboard electric power systems and components, emphasizing shipboard power generation, propulsion, distribution and control; power quality, continuity, and system stability; electric power system/component level modeling and simulation; energy storage technologies; and electrical system survivability.  The components and systems of interest include: - Integrated ship electric power technologies - Electric propulsion motors and propulsion motor drives - Gas turbine and diesel engines, generators and generator sets - Electric machinery energy storage technologies - Electro-acoustics - System protection components - Power converters - Fuel cells - Advanced current, voltage, and other diagnostic sensor development - Automated system reconfiguration - Thermal management and alternative cooling systems - Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) concepts - Power system and component prognostics Candidate propulsion motor concepts include Permanent Magnet Motors (radial air gap, axial air gap, transverse flux - with variations in armature winding arrangement, pole number, cooling, magnet material, and acoustic performance features), Induction Motors (wound rotor, squirrel cage - with variations in armature winding arrangement, pole number, cooling methods, slot geometry and skew and in mechanical details), Superconducting field type (homopolar d.c., synchronous a.c. - with variations in armature topology, magnet materials and cooling approach, armature cooling and current collector approach).  The drivers and issues associated with these designs include acoustic signature, noise modeling, identification of noise sources, mitigation methods, shock, vibration, coolant temperature, manufacturing infrastructure, commercial commonality, platform commonality, cost, torque, power, weight, diameter, length, voltage, noise (requirements/limitations), motor configuration, and!  ship arrangements constraints.   Motor drives that may be explored include cycloconverter (with variations in control and power device types), pulse width modulated converter/inverter (with many variations in topology (resonant link, ARCP, multi level), switching (hard switched, soft switched), control, cooling, filtering, active commutation energy recovery), and matrix converter (with variations in control, topology, cooling, power device type). Power Generation concepts include: 60 Hz wound rotor synchronous generator driven directly by a marine gas turbine (up to 30 MVA rating); 4 pole, 120 Hz, COTS derived or militarized design variant of above, (c) Higher speed, higher frequency, high power density variants of above with high speed or geared turbine drive, (d) High speed, high frequency, wound rotor synchronous generator, direct turbine driven, (e) Permanent magnet field variants of all above, and (f) Fuel cell, reformed diesel fuel, 0.5 to 5 MW modular rating, power electronic interface to main or ship service power distribution buss, (PEM, Solid  Oxide, Molten Carbonate versions), COTS derived design.  The specific design issues to be considered include fuel efficiency, size, weight, cost, maintainability, availability, harmonic loading, voltage, power, fault protection, interface to main or ship service buss, and commercial availability. A number of alternative energy storage technologies and/or configurations (location within the distribution system and capacity) may be considered for future IPS ship applications. Shipboard power quality and continuity along with examination of the implications of future high power/pulse power loads on configuration/technology alternatives is critical.

EVALUATION INFORMATION 1. 	Evaluation Criteria –  1.1	White Papers Evaluation of the “White Papers” will be based on a competitive selection resulting from a scientific review using the following evaluation criteria: (1) overall scientific and technical merits of the concept; and (2) potential Naval relevance and contributions of the effort to the improved performance of an IPS.  Selection of the Offeror(s) from which Full Proposals will be requested, will be based upon the Government’s assessment of Items (1) and (2).    1.2	Full Proposals Award decisions will be based on a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a scientific review. Evaluations will be conducted using the following evaluation criteria: (1) overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal; (2) potential naval relevance and contributions of the improved performance of an IPS; (3) the offeror's capabilities, related experience/past performance, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (4) the qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader and key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives;  and (5) the realism of the proposed cost and availability of funds. The degree of importance of the offeror’s cost will be evaluated based on the assessment of the overall technical merit of the proposal and the funds available for the technology area proposed. 2.  Evaluation Panel -  Technical and cost proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-5 and 15.207.  The cognizant Government experts will perform the evaluation of technical proposals.  Cost proposals will be evaluated by Government business professionals.  Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter-expert technical consultants. Similarly, support contractors may be utilized to evaluate cost proposals. However, proposal selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of Government personnel. Each support contractor’s employee having access to technical and cost proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any proposal submissions.   VII.   SECURITY CLASSIFICATION   In order to facilitate intra program collaboration and technology transfer, the Government will attempt to enable technology developers to work at the unclassified level to the maximum extent possible.  If access to classified material will be required at any point during performance, the offeror must clearly identify such need prominently in their proposal.  If developers use unclassified data in their deliveries and demonstrations regarding a potential classified project, they should use methods and conventions consistent with those used in classified environments.  Such conventions will permit the various subsystems and the final system to be more adaptable in accommodating classified data in the transition system. ****

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to award a contract to an Architect-Engineering Firm that will be selected to perform a Preliminary Engineering Report (PER) for a New Office building at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.  The Office Building is planned to house 520 occupants at approximately 100,000 square feet and shall be designed to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards for a minimum of "Silver" rating and strive to meet a LEED rating of "Gold".  This project must provide parking, utilities and all other ssociated items required to operate the facility.   This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The order of magnitude for this procurement is between $100,000 and $250,000 and the effort shall be completed within 180 calendar days after notice to proceed. The Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications is due January 12, 2005.  Please provide the following information on your Architect-Engineer Qualifications Form for this Preliminary Engineering Report:    1.  The successful firm shall have designed and participated in the construction and activation of a LEEDS Silver or Gold office type facility equal in size to the magnitude of this project.  2.  Certification and Accreditations:	LEED accreditation is required.  If accredited by the US Green Building Council, so indicate for each individual.  List other certifications and accreditations of proposed team members or the firms that are relevant to the project.   3.  Provide details in your submittal on the particular projects you designed.	   4.  Detail a sample sustainable project previously designed by your firm.  This sample shall include a demonstration of your capabilities related to LEEDS and sustainable design.   5.  Demonstrate your LEEDS experience with details on how your projects specifically addressed good indoor air quality including such measures as specifying adhesives with low levels of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), low VOC paints, low-toxic building materials and required air exchanges that meet ASHRAE standards.   6.  Demonstrate site planning considerations to work with the natural environment, maximize solar energy potential and the use of natural light, and minimize off-site storm water runoff.   7.  Demonstrate experience in environmental planning and implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process including performing the Environmental Assessment. 8.  Demonstrate experience with construction and budget estimating.   9.  Demonstrate experience using Life Cycle Cost Analysis techniques for material and equipment selection.    10.  Demonstrate specifications which specify use of recycled content materials and recycling of construction waste and building material after demolition. 11.  Provide details on projects which are specifically similar in climate to the Houston, Texas area.   12.  Provide a list of client references including phone numbers for relevant experience and past performance verification.   PROPOSER SUPPLEMENT: A.  Other than the general disciplines, NASA-JSC has listed specific specialty capabilities you are expected to need for the term of this contract.  Be sure to document your ability to provide the specialty capabilities.  A firm which can only partially meet the capabilities will not likely be considered. B.  Show clearly how you plan to manage the design work and how you will organize your team.  Provide an organization chart or matrix to show how the design team will work. C.  “Clearly” organize your content on the  SF 330 forms (this replaces the old SF 254’s & 255’s) for you as prime and any sub-contractors(consultants) to make it easy to see and understand your capabilities and your sub-contractor’s capability. D.  Much extraneous formatting or “supplemental” information obscures your capability and is not helpful.  Provide a clean, clear, and professional but not ostentatious package.  E.  Indicate any past work history you have with other firms that will be on your team.  F.  It is not of particular benefit to list employees of a large firm that are in other locations throughout the country who will not likely be used on this project.  Personnel resources you do plan to use and where they are located is important information. G.  Indicate clearly the function an individual performed on a particular project you have listed to substantiate their capability.  Were they performing detailed design, reviews, checker, team lead, project manager, or other function? H.  When referencing other projects on which your firm has performed design services, or your consultants, indicate the function or what part of the design you performed - for example: were you prime, sub-contractor, mechanical only etc.  I.  Resumes of all key people in each discipline that “will be” used are very important. J.  Be sure you address all the criteria for selection.  The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 541310 and $4.0M, respectively.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

<DESC>17.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI5009 and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent. This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2001-25. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure, on a sole-source basis – using simplified acquisitions procedures- clinical patient samples from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Md., for use in NIAID Project# Z01- AL00358-14 “Immunopathogenesis of Chlamydia Trachomatis Infection.”  The Hopkins School of Medicine has had long-standing access to patients with sexually-transmitted diseases and has provided diagnostic testing services using advanced molecular probes for Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, Trichomonas and HIV for the Institute.  For the good of the government, the vendor should not be changed now because many of the patients who have provided clinical specimens to this laboratory for past and current studies will continue to be followed in the future.  The NIAID is dependent on the use of these specimens, which require repeated collation of cells from these patients as part of longitudinal analyses. To change patient populations now would make such prospective follow-up impossible and seriously limit the number and kinds of scientific discoveries that can be derived from this data. This is not a Small-Business Set Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 621511 and the small-business size standard is $11.5 million dollars. This is a firm fixed-price contract, and the FOB terms are “Destination.” These items will be delivered to a NIAID facility in Baltimore, MD. The anticipated period of performance will be 12/24/04-09/30/05. FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contractor Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items. FAR 52.225-3. Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items. Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) is required. [Note: Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration will make an offeror ineligible for award]. By submission, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. Registration is available via the Internet at www.CCR.gov. Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 P.M. (EST) Eastern Standard Time, Friday, December 24, 2004.  For delivery of responses through the Postal Service, the address is AMOB/NIAID/NIH, 10401 Fernwood Road, Suite 2NE70, Room/2NE38C, MSC/4812, Bethesda, Maryland 20817-4812. Electronic submissions will not be accepted. Requests for information concerning this requirement are to be addressed to LaDonna Stewart at 301-402-5770. Collect calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>Range Instrumentation Systems, Air Combat Support, Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), Florida, plans to award a sole source contract to Rockwell Collins, 400 Collins Road, NE Cedar Rapids, IA 52498-0001, for the follow-on phases to the current Next Generation Range Instrumentation (NexRI) Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT)-to-Range Instrumentation Waveform (RIW):  Phase 1 (Study and Analyses) initial Range Instrumentation Waveform (RIW) development effort.  The contemplated contract will include three phases (Phases 2 – 4) running through FY07 where each phase builds upon the previous phase.  Phase 1 (Studies and Analyses) has identified areas where changes are needed to transform TTNT into the RIW.  Phase 1 captured architecture trade offs, provided alternatives and parameter choices which optimize the RIW, and preserved much of the TTNT performance within the NexRI constraints.  The key deliverable from Phase 1 is the Draft Range Instrumentation Waveform specification.  Because Rockwell Collins has completed Phase 1 and because detailed information and experience with TTNT development is required for this follow-on effort, they are uniquely capable of performing the required tasks for Phases 2 – 4.  Rockwell Collin’s extensive knowledge as the sole developer on the TTNT and RIW allows them to satisfy the Air Force’s requirements for the follow-on effort within the program timeline and budget.  Phase 2 (Simulation, Modeling and Hardware Survey) will develop simulations and provide analysis and refinement of the RIW attributes defined in Phase 1.  The activities of this phase will optimize the Signal-in-Space (SiS) and processor loading based on simulation and modeling of the RIW for various scenarios.  Candidate transceivers will be identified to host the RIW.  The target hardware (HW) will be selected to leverage previous TTNT and Phase 1 developments and lower implementation risk for Phase 3.  Changes to the RIW specification will be based on the analysis, optimization, modeling and HW selection.  Phase 3 (Prototype Development) tasks include Systems Engineering necessary to provide a final functional decomposition and allocation of requirements to transceiver subsystems, Hardware Design and Software Design Development, Implementation of the RIW, Prototype Build, and Integration and Test.  Phase 4 (Demonstration and Flight Test) will prepare for and conduct a series of flight tests.  A sole source contract is the only way to ensure P5 Combat Training Systems (P5CTS) will meet schedule requirements to begin integration for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) compliance by September 2007.  Joint Tactical Radio System compliance is the first step to permit interoperability of test and training range systems by FY09.  Funding and schedule constraints preclude duplication of Phase 1 efforts.  Due to unique experience with TTNT and RIW, only Rockwell Collins can effectively and efficiently accomplish the follow-on phases within funding and schedule constraints.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Mrs. Karen S. Turner, karen.turner@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850)-883-3404, FAX (850) 882-3226, or the Contract Specialist, Mr. Erik Urban, erik.urban@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850)-883-3434.

<DESC>This acquisition is for a firm fixed-price contract consisting of a  base period for one unit, plus one pre-priced option for an additional unit. The base period will be approximately six months in length with an option for another six months for the second unit.  It is anticipated that it will take six months per stand. The requirement is to repair and refurbish two empennage platforms (hereinafter referred to as the tail stands) designed to service the tail components of C-5A aircraft.  The tail stands shall be brought to fully functional condition, upgraded and modified.  The tail stand is a 70-ton (approximate), 70-foot tall, self-propelled lattice structure comprised of square tubing weldments.  The main structural members are four leg columns joined by bolting to structural fixed deck supports.  The structure is arranged to envelop the tail of the aircraft and provide six work levels, all connected by stairs and serviced by a 1000-pound capacity elevator.  The sixth work level provides access to the horizontal stabilizer.  Each work level consists of a fixed deck that houses a set of sliding deck panels that are manually pulled out to close the gap between the edge of the fixed deck and the vertical stabilizer.  The stand is also equipped with a 1000-pound capacity jib crane, a 1000-pound capacity traveling hoist on an I-beam, and four stabilizing jacks. The tail stand is supported by four two-wheel axles: two fixed axles are powered by a hydrostatic drive, and two steered axles are un-powered.  A 107 HP, 2800-RPM gasoline engine provides the power to drive and steer the stand at 2 mph in still air and at a slower speed against 40 mph wind. The nominal working pressure of the hydraulic system is 2000 psi.  When in position around the tail, the elevator, jib crane, and the hoist are powered through an electric cable from the hangar power source. The NAICS code is 332312 with a corresponding small business size standard (not to exceed) 500 Employees.

This will be a firm-fixed price contract. If there are any other businesses that can provide the specified service according to required thresholds cited, they must respond to this notice before 0900 hrs (Pacific time) on December 13, 2004.  The POC for this notice is Captain David Huber, Contracting Officer, who can be contacted at (702) 652-3369, or by e-mail at david.huber@nellis.af.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Sean Murphy, 508-233-6255
<DESC>Please note: Solicitation Number #W911QY05R1918 is replaced with Solicitation #W911QY05R0002. The U.S. Army RDECOM - Natick Contracting Division, in support of the US Army Soldier Systems Center-Natick has a requirement for a new Advanced Combat Helm et (ACH) which will replace the helmet known as the Personnel Armor System Ground Troops (PASGT). The ACH will provide an improved helmet to Soldiers that in addition to providing the Soldier ballistic and impact protection, will be used as a  platform t o mount electronics such as communication devices, and Night Vision devices among other items.  As a helmet it will provide standard Helmet, Ground Troops and Parachutists and (PASGT) protection as well as increased 9mm protection. The reduced edge cut o f the ACH, although reducing area of coverage, will improve the field of vision and hearing, leading to better situational awareness over the current helmet. The ACH has five basic components: The helmet shell, the pad suspension system, the retention syst em (chinstrap/napestrap), helmet cover, and eye strap.  The Government anticipates that this requirement will be a Full and Open Competitive acquisition, however, the Government reserves the right to change the solicitation procedure. It is anticipated tha t a final Fedbizopps Announcement and solicitation will be released the first week in January 2005 with proposals due 30 days later. Firms shall not be reimbursed for any costs associated with proposals.  The Government envisions that multiple Firm-Fixed-P rice (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts  will be awarded as a result of the Request for Proposals (RFP) but reserves the right to award one or none. The Government anticipates a one-year Base Ordering Period, with four, one-year  Options. If one contract is awarded, the anticipated minimum requirement is 100 ACHs and a maximum requirement of  880,000 ACHs and applicable spare parts kits for the entire period of performance. If more than one contract is awarded the yearly requireme nts will be divided (ratio to de determined) among successful offerors. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE WILL THE TOTAL REQUIREMENT EXCEED MORE THAN 880,000 ACHs.  Offerors are to note that Federal Prison Industries (FPI) also known as UNICOR, is currently the mandat ory source for helmets. Currently, UNICOR does not have a helmet that meets the ACH requirements. However, at some time UNICOR may develop a helmet that meets the ACH requirements. If the Contracting Officer makes a determination in the future that UNICOR helmets meets the Governments needs in terms of quality, price and time of delivery, UNICOR may be eligible to receive a portion of the aforementioned requirement. The required source for the pad suspension systems, helmet covers and eye straps will be Na tional Industries for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) and National Industries for the Blind (NIB). When released, the solicitation, including all amendments, and applicable documents (with the exception of patterns, if applicable) will only be available in  electronic medium at US Army RDECOM  Natick Contracting at https://www3.natick.army.mil .  A draft Performance Specification (subject to change) is posted at the Natick website (https://www3.natick.army.mil then by going to Business Opportunities and the n to Ongoing Acquisitions)and is open for questions and comments until December 20,2004.

<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The Federal Response Plan of the Department of Homeland Security designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response to man-made or natural disasters. In 2002, HHS established the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP). This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies threatening the civilian population. The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for response to a public health emergency. ***DESCRIPTION*** This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. DHHS/OPHEP/ORDC has a requirement for the acquisition and maintenance of novel therapeutic products for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to treat U.S. civilians exposed to weapons of mass destruction, including nerve agents. Nerve agents include organophosphorous insecticides, soman, sarin, tabun, VX and Non-Traditional Agents (NTA's). HU-BCHE has been demonstrated to be effective as a prophylactic against nerve agent induced mortality and morbidity. HU-BChE is isolated and purified from the Cohn Fraction IV-4 of human plasma. The Government has an interest in identifying sources of GMP HU-BChE and developing capabilities for the licensure of an appropriately formulated preparation of HU-BChE for either intravenous or intramuscular injection.  While proof-of-principle animal studies have been completed, additional animal challenge studies are likely needed to support the eventual licensure of the product. In responding to this RFI, indicate the proposed process for extraction and purification; potential formulations for intramuscular injection; and production capacity annually (estimate).  

The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources of HU-BChE, manufactured under a commercial scale GMP process, tested for efficacy in animal models of nerve agent exposure and for safety in human volunteers. Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DHHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy to meet the Nation's bioterrorism defense needs. Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit a capability statement to the DHHS. All information submitted to DHHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. 

Information must be submitted by January 14, 2005. Responses should be limited to 25 pages and are preferred in electronic format and can be e-mailed to the attention of Darrick A. Early, phone 202-401-3693, email darrick.early@hhs.gov. Please ensure that at least TWO (2) COPIES of all responses are submitted.

Under provisions laid out in the Project BioShield Act of 2004, future competition may be limited to sources responding to this request for information (Sec. 319F-2(c)(7)(C)(vii) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 274d-6b).

<DESC>HARDWARE ENVIRONMENT The hardware architecture for MODS consists of an Enterprise and Internet architecture.  The central host for the MODS hardware environment is the IBM Z800 Mainframe with ZOS.  The DB2/ZOS v7 database, the transaction processing using CICS, the reports sys tem using TSO, and the communications protocols for the various networking environments reside on this Enterprise Server.  There is a collection of equipment to support the communications connections including an IBM Open Systems Adaptor, an IBM 3172, seve ral IBM 3174's, several Cisco routers, Ethernet hubs and switches, digital telecom switches, a bank of modems, and several CSU/DSU's. The Internet portion of MODS is a collection of servers operating under a Windows Server 2003 Active Directory Security Schema. There is a Dell/EMC Storage Area Network in use that is the primary storage location for all clustered database server devices a nd other data. All the MODS Active Directory Servers are all Windows Server 2003.  The MODS Database Servers are Windows Server 2000 Enterprise with SQL Server 2000 installed.  Our database servers are clustered using Microsoft Cluster Services, with the s hared data residing on the SAN for failover capability. The MODS FTP Server is Windows Server 2003.  All the MODS Web Servers are Windows Server 2003 (IIS 6).  The web servers are load-balanced with Microsoft Application Center.  The web servers are also loaded with the .Net framework.  MODS hosts a mix of ASP and ASP.Net applications, as well as .Net Web Services on the server clusters. ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT The MODS Enterprise Software environment consists of a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and application source code.  The application source code includes interactive transaction processing using CICS and TSO interfaces for standard and ad-hoc  report generation.  Middleware applications allow for real-time updates, additions, deletions, and queries to be processed through the stored procedures, EXCI calls, RPCs and dynamic SQL.  Access Security for both the Enterprise and mainframe-based web ap plications is controlled via Logon ID and password.  Access via the Internet is secured through 128-bit encryption.  SOURCE CODE The MODS source code is comprised of COBOL II, CICS (including Shadow Direct RPCs, Structured Query Language and DB2 External & SQL Stored Procedures), JCL, CLISTS, ISPF Panels, ISP Skeletons, CICS Basic Mapping Support (BMS), FOCUS, and SAS.

<DESC>This sources sought is a request for information prior to drafting and releasing any resultant solicitation.  The information contained in this sources sought notification is based on the best and most current information available to date, is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.  Any significant changes will be provided in a subsequent synopsis, if required.  The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) is seeking potential sources capable of providing the service of conducting a study to understand the technical feasibility and historical success of the re-host process and the technical feasibility and complexity involved in potentially expanding SCIP and DSAMS (2 of DSCA's systems) to include the requirements in the ORD.  The following is a sampling of questions that DSCA would like for each prospective industry partner to address in such a study:

Part 1:  Confirm Re-Host information and answer lingering questions/issues about feasibility and cost

1.  How much of the Re-Host process can be done using “automated” tools---and how much will have to be done manually?

2.  What is the estimated cost to do the “automated” portion of the Re-Host and what is the estimated cost to do the “manual” portion?

3.  How long would the Re-Host process take to go from 4-to-4 and then 4-to-1?…and when would we see a finished product that is ready for use by the Military Departments (MILDEPs)?  Any improvements to the business process will not likely take place until the Modernization phase, so this is a key question.

4.  Is there any business benefit to Re-Hosting the systems other than positioning ourselves ultimately for the Modernization phase?

5.  How different would the finished product look from the legacy systems?  Would there be a huge learning curve for the users?

6.  Can any standardization be done during the 4-to-1 process?  There have been conflicting opinions on this.

7.  After the 4-to-1 Re-Host, do we really have a single system, or do we still have 4 different systems within a larger system?----which might mean we still have to make changes in 4 different parts of the larger system?

8.  How do you test to ensure the new system matches the old system functionality one-for-one?

9.  What are the pros/cons of doing a pilot to test the Re-Host process before committing to all 4 systems?

10.  What happens to the legacy systems while these conversions are taking place?  Can they still be used in their current state?---we must be able to continue requisition and financial processing during the 4-to-4 and 4-to-1 phases.  Do we have to make a “copy” of the legacy systems for this to work?  If so, do we have to convert data to “catch-up” the new versions of the systems with the processing that takes place after the copies are made?

11.  Once the conversion takes place, would it be possible (and prudent) to do parallel processing until we have confidence that the Re-Hosted systems work as intended?

12.  What happens to SCIP while these conversions are taking place?---we will continue to need daily extractions of data to ensure SCIP stays current.  What happens to SCIP after they are completed, assuming a successful Re-Host?---extractions will need to be done from the newly Re-Hosted systems into SCIP.

13.  What is industry doing with major automation systems that they need to update?

	13.a.  Is industry using Re-Host initiatives?  

	13.b.  What is industry learning about the promises vice delivery (reality) on Re-host projects---meaning is the 80% automated and 20% manual prediction proving to be accurate?

	13.c.  For automated conversion, what is the industry success record for various languages – specifically with the multiple different languages that we have? 

	13.d.  Is industry consolidating into large systems?  Can we do some benchmarking with industry regarding system size and advantages/disadvantages of having separate, smaller Service systems vice a single, large consolidated system?

	13.e.  Is there any rough costing data from industry?  What does this data mean and how does it compare to any case studies that have been done for Re-Host?

14.  Are there examples where Re-Host has been done successfully in the past on similar government systems?

15.  What experiences have customers had with maintainability of code after a Re-Host operation?  Specifically, do most clients manage to master and evolve the new code in-house?  Or are the clients forever dependent on the Re-Host vendor for post-Re-Host maintenance?  Do most clients keep the Re-Hosted code stable and try not to change it---or do most ultimately abandon it for something more maintainable?

16.  Does the Re-Host option make sense for the Forte conversion?   Can the Re-Host strategy be used to convert the Case Development Module (CDM) portion of DSAMS?  When could that be started in relation to deployment of the training module (in other words would we have to wait to convert CDM until the Training Module is deployed)?  What are the pros/cons of doing the Forte conversion on the CDM earlier if that is possible?
Part 2:  Determine feasibility of building incrementally using SCIP and DSAMS

1.  SCIP was originally designed as a system that merely displays information that has been processed by other systems.  We have expanded that concept to include some functionality on SCIP that is independent of the legacy systems (e.g., End-Use Monitoring).  How far can we go with SCIP in terms of adding functionality to it?  Would this require additional hardware/server/software/etc.?  Can SCIP take the number of concurrent users that might use a more robust system that included more case execution functionality?

2.  Is it technically feasible to meet the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) by building on SCIP and DSAMS?

3.  Can portions of the legacy systems be turned off as functionality is added to SCIP and DSAMS?

4.  If we develop a sample list of projects/functionality to start with, can we estimate how much each of those projects would cost and develop a projected timeline for each?  Can we estimate the extent of changes that would need to be made to the legacy systems for some of these projects?

5.  One proposal (referred to as “Case Execution Management Information System (CEMIS) Now”) for where to begin is with a new requisition database built into SCIP that would take all existing requisition fields from all of the case execution legacy systems; add to that the new fields needed for Defense Logistics Management Standards (DLMS) compliance; and add a translator to allow requisitions to process from this database through the legacy systems for further processing in the domestic systems.  This could essentially be the first part of the incremental build and might utilize some aspects of Re-Hosting, Best of Breed, and New Build.  What is the technical feasibility of this, the potential cost, and the expected timeline for completion?  

6.  Can we estimate annual sustainment costs needed to build incrementally on SCIP while continuing to maintain the legacy systems still in “Brown Out” mode?

7.  What would this proposal mean in terms of DSADC resources?

EDT to Mrs.  Beth Baker, Email:  Beth.Baker@dsca.mil, Mark.Scher@dsca.mil, and Mrs. Toye Latimore, Email:  Toye.Latimore@dsca.mil.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) from interested Federal Supply Schedule 70 contractors.   The Commission currently operates an Exchange Database System (“EDBS”), which processes and maintains all trades executed on U.S. futures exchanges.  The EDBS was developed to provide investigators, futures trading specialists, and economists with a mechanism to obtain reports and other relevant information for profiles of traders in each trading pit, trade practice investigations and other kinds of analyses based on trade data received from the exchanges. The current EDBS was originally created to run on a legacy mainframe system and currently uses client server architecture on the Microsoft platform.  The application has several components that have been developed in COBOL, Powerbuilder, Microsoft SQL Server, and a Microsoft Data Transformation Services. The existing EDBS processes and maintains information concerning open outcry trades, ex-pit trades, and electronic trades on U.S. exchanges.  The current system is a batch-oriented application that consists of approximately two hundred COBOL programs.  The EDBS currently holds approximately 800 gigabytes of data, expected to increase at least 400 gigabytes in the next year.   CFTC intends to replace EDBS with a completely re-designed electronic trade analysis system (referred to as the Trade Repository Analytical Development Environment or “TRADE” System).  The Commission has drafted a Request for Quotation for a Federal Supply Schedule task order to complete the first phase of the Trade project.  The first phase includes a requirements analysis, preliminary design and technology assessment, with options for continued program management and IV&V support throughout the Trade project.  It is anticipated that acquisition of hardware, software and integration services will be the subject of separate procurements.  The draft RFQ is accessible on this Fedbizopps web site.  The purpose of this notice and draft RFQ is to obtain the following information from potential sources: (1) whether or not your firm is interested in submitting a quotation for a Federal Supply Schedule task order; (2) whether or not the draft RFQ statement of work is sufficiently clear; (3) whether or not there is adequate technical information in the RFQ to reasonably price the effort on a time and materials basis; (4) a non-binding cost estimate to complete the scope of work of the draft RFQ; (5) a description of any special technology that might be appropriate to the TRADE System; (6) suggestions on standards or acceptance criteria for deliverables described in the RFQ; and (7) any other suggestions or comments.  Please submit responses by email to “ngraham@cftc.gov” by December 22, 2004.  NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS AND NO QUOTATIONS OR OTHER MATERIAL SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD OF A TASK ORDER OR CONTRACT.  CFTC anticipates that a final RFQ will be released following receipt and review of comments submitted in response to this notice.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis solicitation for commercial services, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This solicitation includes applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2001-25 (11/2004). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 621511 and the business size standard is $11.5M.  The Government will furnish all necessary materials, equipment and facilities for the contractor to perform the required services.  Background information:  The Neuromuscular Diseases Section, National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), is involved in the investigation of immunological and genetic basis of a wide range of neuromuscular diseases.  The investigations involve use of tools in immunology, biochemistry, proteomics, genomics and conventional genetics.  Also being conducted are several clinical trials to study the efficacy and pharmcogenetics of drugs used in the treatment of neuromuscular diseases like inclusion body myositis, stiff- person syndrome, demyelinating neuropathies and post polio syndrome.  One of the major focuses is the study of the role of T cells in these diseases by isolating them and characterizing structure-function relationships.  Contractor shall provide an individual with expertise in T cell cloning, expansion, T cell phenotyping, lymphocyte isolation, human skeletal muscle culture, isolation of t cells from muscle biopsy samples, protein separation, immunoblotting, and molecular biology techniques.  This is a non-personal service contract.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the services described in the statement of work.  The contractor shall meet with the Project Officer within five (5) calendar days after contract award to discuss the contract and to ensure mutual understanding of operating procedures and the services to be performed.  Contract Requirements:  A. Specific Tasks.  1) The contractor shall conceptualize, develop and organize experimental protocols in the study of neuromuscular diseases.  B.  Specific techniques and methods to be performed by the contractor.  2) Culture human skeletal muscle cells from biopsies of patients with neuromuscular diseases. The contractor should have prior experience of culturing human skeletal muscle cells from biopsies including initiating explant cultures, maintaining, splitting and various passages, 3) Cloning and culturing T cells from human skeletal muscle biopsies; isolate T cells from skeletal muscle biopsies of patients with neuromuscular diseases. 4) Clone and culture cytotoxic T cells and immunophenotype them.  The contractor shall have experience in cloning and culturing cytotoxic T cells from human muscle biopsies, 5) T cell cloning from Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and characterization. The contractor shall perform T cell cloning from the cerebrospinal fluid, expand and immunophenotype the cells by FACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting/Scanning), 6) Protein separation and detection techniques.  The contractor shall have experience in the separation of proteins by denaturing and non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, transferring onto appropriate membranes, and immunodetection of proteins using appropriate antibodies.  This is a technique that requires excellent skill, as problems like signal to background ratios, inappropriate loading or immunodetection can ruin the experiments that use precious patient-derived biological samples. The contractor shall have experience  in using human brain proteins, 7) Real time and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  methodologies to quantify gene expression; isolate RNA and DNA, prepare cDNA and perform meticulous PCR experiments with large number of samples and data analysis. Very little amounts of muscle biopsies are to be used with at most, care and patience to obtain maximum yield, 8) FACS. The contractor shall analyze lymphocyte subsets, specifically T and B cells, for cell surface markers and intracellular cytokines to characterize the phenotype and function. This is accomplished by three and four color FACS analysis and immunostaining for intracellular proteins.  This will also involve fractionation of subsets of T and B cells by affinity columns and magnetic separation techniques, 9) Radioimmunoassay. The contractor shall perform radioimmunoassay to quantitate GAD65 antibodies in the sera and CSF, 10) Immunoassays: The contractor shall perform ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) experiments to quantitate cytokines and chemokines and, 11) T cell proliferation assays: The contractor shall perform thymidine uptake assays to assess T cell proliferation.  Contractor shall notify the Project Officer if the assigned task was not accomplished at the end of each month.  A statement regarding the appropriate reasoning shall be completed and provided to the project officer via the laboratory notebook or Microsoft word document.  C.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: firm-fixed price proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-05-Q-0006  and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14 effective June 23, 2003.

BACKGROUND

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  NARA is an independent Federal agency that helps preserve our nation's history by overseeing the management of all Federal records. Our mission is to ensure ready access to the essential evidence that documents the rights of American citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience. We must make it easy for citizens to access this essential evidence regardless of the location of the documentation or of the people using it. 

In accordance with 44 USC 2108, the Archivist [of the United States] is responsible for the
“custody, use, and withdrawal of records transferred to him.”   44 USC 2109 authorizes the Archivist to “provide for the preservation, arrangement, .description, and exhibition of records....”  

Museum Programs (NWE).  The Museum Programs staff administers NARA’s exhibition programs, educational programs, and volunteer services.  It is responsible for developing systematically designing programs for various audiences that communicate NARA’s mission, develop an appreciation of NARA goals, and foster an understanding of the national experience.   Audiences served by Public Programs include the general public, educators and students, the researcher community, the Federal government, and the archival community.  

Each year, approximately one million visitors come to the Rotunda to view the Charters of Freedom and other changing exhibits.  Millions more visit the Online Exhibit Hall and The Digital Classroom each year.  Thousands of educators attend document- based workshops or use document-based publications in their classrooms, while NARA’s docents provide thousands more with behind-the-scenes tours and document workshops for community and school groups.  NARA’s archival holdings are also featured in public lectures, conferences, film series, performances, and special events attended by a wide variety of constituents throughout the year.  

Exhibits Staff (NWE-X).  The Exhibits staff creates and maintains the major exhibitions in the Rotunda and the Special Exhibitions Gallery of the National Archives Building in Washington, DC and at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland; develops traveling exhibits, facsimiles exhibits, and online exhibits (see www.archives.gov); and coordinates the loan of original documents for exhibition outside of the agency.  In addition to these duties, the exhibits staff assists other NARA units with the creation of permanent and traveling exhibits. 

Exhibition Spaces at the National Archives:   NARA exhibits original documents and artifacts from its holdings and from non-NARA sources at the National Archives Building in Washington, DC and its presidential libraries (Hoover through Clinton, except Nixon). 

National Archives Building.   Original documents and artifacts are displayed in the Rotunda, Special Exhibition Gallery, and East and West Rotunda Galleries.  Security guards are stationed in gallery spaces during public hours and patrol these space during non-public hours.  The galleries are also protected with electronic surveillance systems.   The building is equipped with a sophisticated climate control system for maintaining appropriate temperature and relative humidity and filtering pollutants from the air. 

Franklin D. Roosevelt Library.  Original documents are displayed in both permanent and changing exhibits galleries.   Security guards are stationed in gallery spaces during public hours and patrol these space during non-public hours.  The galleries are also protected with electronic surveillance systems.   The building is equipped with a sophisticated climate control system for maintaining appropriate temperature and relative humidity and filtering pollutants from the air. 

Storage Areas at the National Archives.    NARA stores original documents and artifacts from its holdings and non-NARA sources at the National Archives Building, the National Archives at College Park, and its presidential libraries (Hoover through Clinton, including Nixon).   All storage areas are protected with appropriate security and climate control systems. 




2.	OBJECTIVE

NWE seeks to purchase a fine arts insurance policy providing wall-to-wall, all risk coverage for non-government property on loan to NARA for exhibition purposes.  (NARA’s permanent collection is self-insured.) “ 
3.	SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

 The written policy must include the following:
