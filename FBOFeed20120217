In accordance with FAR 5.207 (c) (15) (ii); all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.Qualification Requirements:  Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to Patrick McGowan at (405) 734-8120; fax (405) 734-8129, or e-mail patrick.mcgowan@tinker.af.mil

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

The targeting applications are run on a 24/7 basis, so the ongoing transition must be smooth and uninterrupted.&nbsp; If this exact software is not used, then the Targeting rule manager will have to be rewritten at considerable cost, or else the targeting engine will be at risk for production errors.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative multidisciplinary research proposals to develop and demonstrate synthesis methods of materials with superior properties (&gt;1.5X over SOA) that currently can only be made using ultrahigh pressure techniques, such that processing under conditions amenable to production scales (&lt;2000 K and 0.5 GPa) and stability under ambient conditions is achieved. Extended solids are polymorphs/phases of simple molecules that are currently formed under ultrahigh pressure conditions where strong intermolecular bonding and tight crystal packing can be induced, leading to dramatic changes in physical, mechanical, and functional properties.

<p>Product Specifications:<br />PFI Standard Specification for Residential/Commercial Densified Fuel<br />American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standards<br />PFI Wood Pellets are certified by the PFI North American Residential/Commercial Densified Fuel Standards Program. Below are the PFI Premium specifications required. <br />&emsp;</p>
<p><br />Fuel Property PFI Premium Specs<br />Normative Information - Mandatory <br />Bulk Density, lb/cubic foot: 40.0-46.0<br />Diameter, inches: 0.230-0.285<br />Diameter, mm: 5.84-7.25<br />Pellet Durability Index: greater than or equal to 96.5<br />Fines, % at the mill gate: less than or equal to 0.50<br />Inorganic Ash %: less than or equal to 1.0<br />Length, % greater than 1.50 inches: less than or equal to 1.0<br />Moisture, %: less than or equal to 8.0<br />Chloride, ppm: less than or equal to 300</p>
<p>Additional information regarding densified product:<br />To assure the consistent quality of densified fuel leaving the production facility, certified product must be packaged, stored, handled, transported, and/or delivered in a manner that will maintain the integrity of the densified fuel produced. As the quality of the densified fuel leaving the production facility is not decisive for customer satisfaction, but rather the quality of the densified fuels that arrive at the end consumer's location, the complete supply chain is considered. The minimum requirements for certified densified fuel packaging, storage, handling, transport, and delivery are as follows:<br />&bull;Densified fuel must not be exposed to moisture, e.g., through contact with condensed water, rain or snow.<br />&bull;Handling areas, silos conveyor equipment, storage containers, and transport vehicles must be regularly checked for soil and/or debris.<br />&bull;Equipment is to be cleaned if necessary to prevent contamination.<br />&bull;Wood pellets usually have a moisture content level of approx. 5-10%. Pellets tend to lose their effectiveness and crumble and thus become unusable if they are exposed to moisture or damp surfaces, therefore it is essential that the wood pellet remain dry for the entire transit, storage, and delivery cycle.<br />&bull;Certified densified fuel of one grade must not be allowed to co-mingle with densifed fuel product of another grade or with non-certified product.<br />&bull;Prospective contractors shall be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award. Contractors may register via the Internet at www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-866-606-8220<br />&bull;DLA point of contact is Joanie M. Brickhill, PH: 703-767-8524</p>

<p>POST DATE : February 17, 2012</p>
<p>CLOSING DATE : February 27, 2012</p>
<p>PROPOSED AWARD DATE : March 02, 2012</p>
<p>Title : QIAGEN Consumable Kits</p>
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA) on behalf of the National Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Institute (NIAMS), Intramural Research Program (IRP), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a non-competitive sole source basis to QIAGEN, 27220 Turnberry Lane, Suite 200, Valencia, CA 91355-1005 for the procurement of the QIAxcel/QIAxtractor/ QIAgility Kits.<br /><br />The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of NIAMS provides a unique contribution to the overall NIAMS research agenda. The IRP has established a tradition of excellence, with a strong focus on long-term, high-risk research, investigations into the genetics and pathophysiology of human disease, and the development of innovative therapies for a number of serious disorders for which satisfactory treatments previously did not exist. <br /><br />The program is firmly grounded on a foundation of world-class basic science research and technology within the NIAMS IRP itself, widespread collaborations with other outstanding intramural clinicians and scientists on the Bethesda campus, and immediate proximity to the largest clinical research hospital in the world. The result is a heady cocktail of cutting-edge laboratory research in immunology, inflammation, genetics, structural biology, developmental biology, biophysics, and cartilage biology, with a generous twist of translational investigation in a number of clinical specialties.<br /><br />The reagents are required for the mouse genotyping core for the NIAMS IRP. The core utilizes QIAGEN robots to genotype several hundreds of genetically-modified mice and rats per week. The robots require specific QIAGEN pasticware and reagents; aerosol-free tips, plates, and tubes are made specifically for these instruments as they fit the particular set up of these robots.<br /><br />The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the QIAGEN consumable kits are required for fully DNA isolation, PCR set up, and automated size separation and quantification of DNA fragments using the QIAxtractor/QIAgility/QIAxcel Advanced System. QIAGEN is the sole manufacturer and distributor of these Kits.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 with business size standard 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-55 (February 2, 2012). This requirement is under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number, NHLBI-CSB-(AR)-2012-076-CRS may be submitted, via email, to Caitlin Savina at caitlin.savina@nih.gov, by February 27, 2012 by 8:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. Faxes will not be accepted. Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative. Information received, as a result of this Notice of Intent, will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement.</p>

Cynthia Simon-Arndt
E-mail:  Cynthia.SimonArndt@med.navy.mil
<DESC>DHAPP continues to rely upon the vital support of various partners, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in implementing HIV prevention, care and treatment programs across the globe.  Each country has a customized plan to help the countries militaries bring its HIV/AIDS programs to sufficient scale to help reduce the spread of the epidemic and mitigate its impact. 

This BAA is intended to solicit existing partners and establish new partners to support the development of a DHAPP.org web site.  This site will serve as a source for program updates, with both a public side for general information, as well as a password protected intranet side, with protected privacy modules for compartmentalized and specific partner information and access.
  An online database is needed so partners can routinely upload their monthly and quarterly expenditure reports, as well as program status based upon a milestone table, created as part of their funding grant.  This database needs to be secure and have the aggregate all individual partners submissions into a single file for download by the DHAPP operations staff in a common format, such as XL and CSV and TXT. Other capacities of the site should include a file structure to upload and download files, internet and email messaging, as well as database functions to support information gathering and analysis. Proposed work should include an infrastructure plan, and a plan for support and/or turnover of the site.
 The site code needs to be made available to the DHAPP staff and ongoing training for DHAPP operations staff will be needed to be able to modify the webpage and database as the reporting needs are changed. Offerors should have prior experience with development and hosting of websites preferably for funding multiple partners, from many countries and cultures and languages, and experience in training staff to use and maintain web based databases.   Offerors should also have with development and hosting of DoD websites, and be familiar with the most recent Information Assurance requirements. Proposals should include a discussion of the current DoD Policy Guides on web hosting and compliance issues should be discussed in detail (http://www.defense.gov/webmasters/).

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE - THE RFP WILL BE POSTED AT LEAST 15 DAYS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THIS POSTING.
<p>The Pennsylvania section of the North Service Center identified a need for a Multiple Award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), contract for repair and alteration construction services over the simplified acquisition threshold, up to prospectus limitations. This procurement will result in multiple awards for projects within these parameters at all locations, owned and leased, within the jurisdiction of the GSA Pittsburgh Field Office, as well as Ohio County in West Virginia (under the jurisdiction of the GSA Charleston Field Office). Using this IDIQ vehicle, ordering officials will place individual task orders utilizing competitive procedures among all vendors awarded contracts through this procurement.</p>
<p>The specific counties not included in these Multiple Award IDIQ contracts are as follows: Pennsylvania - Philadelphia; Delaware; Chester; Montgomery; and, Bucks Counties. All other counties in the state of Pennsylvania are included in this procurement.</p>
<p>The term of the contracts will be for a one (1) year base with four (4) one (1) year options. The contracts will not include pre-negotiated line item pricing (except for assorted hourly rates). Rather, each task order will be competed among the awardees of the IDIQ contract using criteria established by the ordering office (price alone, or a combination of price and technical factors). This contract vehicle may be utilized by both Regional and Field Office personnel. All awardees under the IDIQ contract will be presented with a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. It is anticipated that no less than three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts will be awarded under this solicitation, although the government reserves the right to award a number of contracts outside this range.</p>
<p>The scope of this contract is to provide: 1) construction services, including, but not limited to: general office renovation; interior construction; exterior construction repair; general repair and alteration work; installation of new and the alteration of existing power panels; carpet and carpet tile replacement; painting; HVAC duct work modification; modification of existing building fire sprinkler systems; plastering and plaster repair work; sidewalk repairs/replacement; asphalt/concrete paving; 2) alteration services, including, but not limited to: electrical, carpentry, masonry, plumbing, mechanical, architectural, landscaping, storm drainage, exterior restoration, waterproofing, re-pointing, cleaning, sealing, design-build services; roofing involving installation, repair and alteration, and removal; and paving relevant to property and roads owned, leased or otherwise under the control of GSA, or other authorized Federal agencies; and other task order related work. In addition, design work incidental to construction as well as design/build work are included. .</p>
<p>This procurement will be set aside for small businesses under FAR Part 19; with a multiple award task order contract awarded to responsible offerors whose proposal(s) offer the best overall value to the Government. The individual orders to be placed under the contracts will range from the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000.00) up to the prospectus limit (currently $2.79 million). Task orders may also be placed outside this dollar range if it is in the best interest of the government to do so; however, awardees have the option to decline any RFP's in this case. Utilizing a multiple award IDIQ will maximize competition, as all awardees will compete for each task order, resulting in favorable competitive pricing for GSA.</p>
<p>The NAICS code applicable to this procurement is 236220. The contracting specialist will verify that offerors submitting proposals are certified to work within this NAICS code.</p>

<CONTACT>Sharon Clisso, Contracting Officer, Phone 816-426-7471, Fax 816-274-6922, Email Sharon.Clisso@noaa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Acquisition Division - Kansas City Office, 601 East 12th Street, Room 1756, Kansas City, Missouri 64106 is conducting market research for the purposes of identifying sources who have demonstrated capabilities in the area of systems administration and computing support. No solicitation of offers is made by this synopsis.
<p>The DOC, NOAA, Air Resources Laboratory (ARL), Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division (ATDD), Oak Ridge, TN, proposes to enter into a contract with Wood International, Inc. on a basis of other than full and open competition. ATDD requires systems administration and computing support services for programmatic and infrastructure needs for a five year period. Base year, April 1, 2012 - March 31, 2013, 1560 hours, with four option years. First Option Year: April 1, 2013 - March 31, 2014, 1560 hours; Second Option Year: April 1, 2014 - March 31, 2015, 1560 hours; Third Option Year: April 1, 2015 - March 31, 2016, 1560 hours; Fourth Option Year: April 1, 2016 - March 31, 2017, 1560 hours.</p>
<p>The requirement is to provide specialized computing support, including computer security, network and server management, desktop and laptop support, programming services, web support, database support, and other computing expertise for ATDD's internal use, as well as these services for programmatic requirements.</p>
<p>The extensive expertise and experience of Wood International, Inc. with the needs of ATDD and its programs, both internal and external, cannot be duplicated without excessive programmatic expense and excessive start up time by any other source. Wood International's experience and outstanding track record with ATDD, its programs, and its unique set of data collection and processing requirements simply cannot be duplicated with as few contractor personnel at as low a cost while maintaining critical continuity of operations both for in-house computing needs as well as for programmatic requirements.</p>
<p>An increasingly critical issue for all Government computer systems is IT security, and the requirements for computer security. The measures, mandated by various federal statutes and internal NOAA processes require a great deal of understanding of the entire ATDD network and each device attached to it, as well as an understanding of the scientific requirements and technical details surrounding their implementation. ATDD's network has largely been engineered, installed, and maintained by Wood International over many years. Wood International has successfully employed countermeasures against countless attacks on ATDD's systems throughout their tenure here at ATDD. ATDD has not experienced a computer security problem that involved an outside attacker for many years, although thousands of attempts have been made. It would take considerable and time-consuming effort by a different contractor to gain the needed familiarity with the complexities surrounding the configuration and management of this network, especially considering the many complex custom-built hardware and software systems. Many of these systems were designed and created by Wood International in collaboration with ATDD scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>In addition to the practical application of successful defenses against computer security attacks, there has been an enormous increase in the required documentation concerning computer and network security. The certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) process that is required to permit a federal facility to operate computers has become more complex and technical each year. This is driven by ever changing requirements with FISMA, Department of Commerce, and NOAA. Wood International has performed the work for every C&amp;A process undergone by ATDD. This process requires documentation concerning every aspect of ATDD's network and each computer on this network: hardware and software inventories, patch management, network topology (including the connections with outside agencies such as DOE), security specifics including policies and procedures, quarterly security sweeps, user training, certification of minimum security standards, testing plans, etc. This documentation requires a deep understanding of the existing network as well as of the various mandates from NIST, DOC, and NOAA that comprise the C&amp;A requirements. Wood International is the only company qualified to perform this work for ATDD. No one else understands the network as a whole well enough to proceed with this process; it would take months for another contractor to gain the requisite knowledge to complete the mandated tasks.</p>
<p>For ATDD's scientific missions, Wood International has worked with scientific and engineering staff to develop unique software, databases, and data collection and processing methodologies whose loss would be highly damaging to existing ATDD programs and prohibitively expensive (if possible at all) to replace. For example, NOAA's national U.S. Climate Reference Network (CRN) equipment database, developed by Wood International, contains an inventory of all CRN-related equipment and associated NIST-traceable calibration records that is critical to the long-term success of the long-term (50 to 100 years) data collection efforts of the CRN program. Another critical system for ATDD is the Regional Air Modeling and Analytical Network (RAMAN). RAMAN is a system of seventeen remotely located observing stations scattered across East Tennessee that collect meteorological data and ozone concentrations. This system incorporates a database and website developed by Wood International that provides secure and quick access to this data in a variety of formats, including graphs and various data file formats, for ATDD and for our regional RAMAN partners. NOAA's Surface Energy Budget Network (SEBN) at ATDD has similar data collection and dissemination system developed by Wood International, including specialized data network links to overcome challenging networking issues at some of the very remote, autonomous SEBN sites. In the area of homeland security, DCNet/URBANet is a congressionally mandated NOAA/ARL program designed to test and evaluate the feasibility of acquiring useful wind turbulence measurements within the complex topology of the urban environment, with particular emphasis on the Washington DC downtown area. Wood International developed the database and website for this crucial program, which is used by a variety of government agencies dealing with homeland security issues. Wood International has also developed the security infrastructure for Threatmap, an ARL homeland security-related system providing critical information to various homeland security planners and emergency response agencies. Wood International has participated in the development and implementation of aircraft-based computer-driven data collection systems for both NOAA and its collaborative partners' research aircraft, including the joint University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI) and Harvard University efforts between ATDD and UTSI and Harvard University.</p>
<p>In the last several years, a host of new software packages have been introduced across NOAA by DOC and NOAA for critical management purposes. These include software for procurement, inventory, budgeting, travel, and time and attendance monitoring. These packages have usually been provided with minimal training and have often not run well from ATDD's remote location. Wood International has provided troubleshooting capabilities that were simply unavailable within NOAA, enabling the new systems to operate properly. In this instance, the key factors were extensively detailed knowledge of the peculiarities of the ATDD network and connection to the Internet, as well as a broad range of experience in making software work.</p>
<p>In short, the expertise and unique knowledge of Wood International of all facets of computing at ATDD, from aircraft-based onboard data collection and processing systems, to remote sensing applications, geographic information systems, and secure wireless networking applications, to the in-house administrative systems necessary for day-to-day operation of the laboratory, and to their expertise in research, development, network design, implementation, DOC network security requirements and software, and network administration simply does not exist with any other source. Wood International currently is under contract and is responsible for the vast majority of the existing core computing infrastructure at ATDD and has maintained it for several years. No other source has the experience and knowledge to perform this function at the required level of competence and skill without an extended learning period.</p>
<p>The extensive expertise and experience supplied by Wood International, Inc., coupled with the software and databases developed by Wood International, Inc., and used extensively throughout ATDD, coupled with their unique understanding of the programs and business practices of ATDD, limits other organizations from assuming a similar role with ATDD.</p>

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) SUMMARY:</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Full Time Equivalent support for Design, Transition and Operation (DTO) of the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) for Army Central Command (ARCENT).</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>This sources sought announcement is published for market research purposes. This market research will be used to help identify small and large sources in the market. Prospective offerors are requested to complete and return a Capabilities Statement as described below to determine which contractors possess the capability, experience and financial ability to provide the support services. The Government is in no way obligated to do business with or to enter into any form of contract with any person, firm, or other entity that receives or responds to this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The Department of Defense (DOD), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program Management Office (PMO) has a requirement to provide FTE engineering and sustainment support for a wide range of program management, technical, research and development, procurement and operations/maintenance services in support of the development, implementation and maintenance of the MNIS CENTRIXS systems. CENTRIXS is the US global, secure, information system to support multinational operations with shared, combined command, control and intelligence information up to the SECRET Releasable (REL) level. CENTRIXS is installed in partner nation countries and their military forces after they establish their specific requirements and relate the requirements with Army Central Command (ARCENT). The basic mission of CENTRIXS is to support the secure sharing and exchanging of intelligence and operational information through reliable communications connectivity, data manipulation, and automated processes. CENTRIXS networks provide ARCENT and other COCOM commanders with enterprise services. Standard CENTRIXS architecture consists of servers, applications, and encryption systems to form an IP-based network. There are approximately over 90 such networks. The MNIS PMO currently has shared Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) responsibility for some of these networks with COCOMs. Most of the MNIS portfolio's operational capabilities are currently or will be operated at DISA Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECC).</p>
<p>SCOPE: The MNIS PMO provides CENTRIXS operations and maintenance at various locations throughout the world. The Contractor shall provide on-site systems engineering and technical support necessary to ensure full operational capability of the existing CENTRIXS nodes at specified ARCENT locations and their associated forward sites. The ARCENT sites range in locations throughout the world and require the following work:</p>
<p>&bull; CENTRIXS systems administration for support to maintain server hardware and software, network operations, systems engineering, information management, and web master services.<br />&bull; Systems integration to include design and engineering for systems such as Global Command and Control System (GCCS), GCCS Integrate Imagery and Intelligence (GCCS-I3), Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC), Automated Message Handling System (AMHS), high assurance guards, and NATO C2 systems/networks<br />&bull; Information and security management<br />&bull; Web master services<br />&bull; Facilitate and establishment of near real time intelligence products in support of ongoing operations.</p>
<p>For the CENTRIXS Community Of Interests (COIs), the Contractor shall support the requirements analysis, design, development, integration and test, implementation and sustainment activities for ARCENT elements building and using CENTRIXS capabilities. The Contractor FTE's shall support regular operations and maintenance of CENTRIXS capabilities at locations including but not limited to Afghanistan, Bahrain, and Kuwait. Contractor staff shall provide on-site systems engineering and technical support necessary to ensure full operational capability of the existing CENTRIXS nodes.</p>
<p>The Contractor must be capable of providing U.S. personnel currently exempt from foreign tax status as defined under the current Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)/ Technical Expert Support Agreement (TESA) or other applicable foreign regulations (as determined by the governments of those countries within which the contractor shall be residing under this contract). It is expected that the Contractor will be able to provide 80% of proposed FTE support by contract performance.. The MNIS PMO is interested in an effective proposed staffing approach from the Contractor that can express an efficient staffing plan to meet the needs of the Government. Historically, there have been 51 to 95 FTEs supporting such work within the U.S. and ARCENT locations. About 95% of the FTE's are to be deployed between Afghanistan, Bahrain, and Kuwait with mainly oversight and programmatic support residing in the U.S. Recommend the type of contract to support the DISA engineering and sustainment support requirement (i.e. firm fixed-price, cost reimbursement, time &amp; materials, hybrid, etc.). The term of the resulting contract will be for a base period plus two (2) option years. NAICS CODE: 541512, Computer Systems Design Services, small business size standard in millions of dollars: $25.5M.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR CAPABILITES STATEMENT: Interested small and large businesses under the requisite NAICS code should provide a capability statement to address their ability and competencies to perform in the areas mentioned above.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns (SDVOSB), for Women-Owned Small Business concerns (WOSB) or for Small Businesses. The small business size standard for NAICS 721110 is $30.0 million. The scope of the acquisition is to provide temporary dining and lodging for the twenty (20) crewmembers of the USCGC KISKA (WPB-1336) during their dry dock availability from 11 APR 2012 thru 10 AUG 2012, a period of performance of one hundred and twenty-one (121) calendar days. Lodging to consist of eight (8) double and four (4) single rooms and meals will be provided for twenty (20) crewmembers. Due to the limited number of shipyards located in the Hawaiian Islands that have the capabilities to dry dock a vessel of this size, there are two (2) possible facilities where the USCGC KISKA can sail to for their 2012 dry dock availability:<br />Location #1; 91-607 Malakaole Road, Kapolei, Hawaii 96707, Island of Oahu or Location #2; Pier 41, Honolulu, Hawaii, 96817, Island of Oahu.
<p>In accordance with FAR 19.502, 19.1305 and FAR 19.1405, if your firm is a small business, HUBZone certified, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business or a Women-Owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond in a letter either by e-mail to Louis.J.Romano@uscg.mil at (757) 628-4651. In your response you must include (a) a positive statement of your intention to submit a quote for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; and (c) past performance references with points of contact and telephone numbers. Your response must also include your statement of intent to submit a quote for either or possibly both shipyards based on the location of the lodging facility, which cannot be more than twenty (20) miles from either of the facilities listed above. In other words, if you have a lodging facility that is within 20 miles of the first location, you can provide a quote for that facility. If you have a lodging facility that is within 20 miles of the second location, you can provide a quote for that facility also. The actual location where the vessel will be going for their availability will be published in the pre-solicitation synopsis once the contract is awarded on or about 10 March 2012. Contractors need to provide applicable Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Veterans Administration Certification and SBA Certification to verify their status as a SDVOSB. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone set-aside, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside, Women-Owned Small Business set-aside or Small Business set-aside. Failure to submit all information and certification requested may result in this requirement being set aside as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone set-aside, SDVOSB set-aside, WOSB set-aside or small business set-aside, will be posted in the Fedbizopps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>
<p>At least two references are requested, but more are desirable. Your response is required by February 23, 2012 at 2:00 pm, EDT. Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HubZone set aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HubZone Set-aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern. Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, FAR 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.</p>
<p>If two companies are planning to conduct business as a Joint Venture or any other type of teaming agreement they shall provide past performance on projects of similar scope that they have performed together, as a Joint Venture. Providing individual past performance documentation from each company on separate projects where the two did not work together is not considered to be sufficient past performance. A Joint Venture that cannot provide this requested information will not be considered to have sufficient documentation needed to evaluate past performance as an evaluation factor.</p>

1.0 	BACKGROUND
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Freight Transportation Program (VAFTP) manages and reports on the delivery, timeliness, and costs to transport goods throughout the national VA infrastructure.  The database applications (General Freight and Operation New Hope Application) for both the freight program and VA's Homeless Veterans Clothing Distribution Program require periodic upgrading, modifications, additional reporting capabilities, systems support, and repairs.  The application resides on a server currently located within the VA Central Office (VACO) network Washington, DC operations facility and is also accessed from remote locations in Chicago, IL and Hillsborough, NJ. Access to these applications is for 14 hours daily.

The VAFTP is functionally divided into two primary functions: (1) freight management and warehousing operations control, and (2) administrative support for network and client systems and database Maintenance.

The VAFTP users are VA transportation and warehousing professionals responsible for the timely and cost-effective transport of goods throughout the VA infrastructure and to other government agencies. Business functions associated with the Program include, but are not limited to:

"	Shipping and delivering goods employing Transportation Service Providers (TSPs). 
"	Tracking freight, booking ocean cargo, obtaining air transport, and negotiating/selecting "best value" carrier rates.  
"	Preparation of warehouse inventories and bills of lading and ocean shipment manifests.
"	Routing and monitoring shipments.
"	Uploading and managing freight rates.
"	Preparation of shipping documents and performing freight bill audits. 
"	Report generation, estimating freight charges.   


VAFTP Business Functions 

"	The receipt and upload of customer transportation service requests and notification of shipment status to customers.
"	Submission of electronic shipping requests, generation of reports on shipment records, creation of freight estimates, access to mileage information, access to truckload, ocean  and less-than-truckload freight rates.
"	Electronic submission of bills of lading to TSPs, customers, contractors, and electronic submission of rate quotation requests to TSPs.
"	Ability to search for and identify user's shipment requests, ensuring all shipment requests are sent to the central operations center and all bills of lading issued show the amount approved for payment during prepayment audit.
"	Tracking and maintaining warehouse receipts, inventories, and shipments, with emphasis on "odd-lot" controls due to differing original-pack units.
"	Preparation of ad-hoc reports in addition to standard reports for shipment manifests, current inventories, bills of lading, and rate quotation requests for distribution to selected users. 
"	Monitoring, deactivating, and notifying selected users when modifying rate files based on business rules; performing archiving functions.
"	Maintenance of archived shipment records, bills of lading, inventory records, and rates for 6 years prior to purging electronic files.

The application's present use is limited to VA's centralized transportation centers in Washington DC, Hillsborough, NJ, and Hines, IL, which covers transportation requests for the entire VA infrastructure and to other government agencies. 

VAFTP has been utilizing Lantica, Inc, Sesame software to provide database management capability to VAFTP Applications (General Freight and Operation New Hope Application).

<DESC>Request for Information
Office Productivity Suite Alternatives Pilot

	 
This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice issued in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) to conduct market research. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The VA is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

VA currently owns and operates Microsoft Office 2003, 2007,and 2010 based productivity suite of office software that includes Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.   This provides the VA interoperability across the enterprise between this productivity suite.   However to lower cost VA wishes to pilot alternatives to the desktop installed versions of the Microsoft Office productivity suite of applications.  VA Office of Information and Technology intends to solicit proposals for alternative architectures for providing an office productivity suite with similar functions that are offered in Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, and where available  Access, Visio, OneNote and Project.  The alternative architecture may be provided through an off-premises cloud system such as Office 365, Google Apps, LotusLive or others.  Or it could be provided through an on-premises cloud based terminal server or application virtualization system providing Microsoft Office 2010 as an example.  Or it could be provided through a desktop installed version of a lower cost office productivity suite such as OpenOffice as another example.  The purpose of the pilot is to understand the issues such as security, supportability,  interoperability, ease of use, end user satisfaction, speed, network requirements and compatibility with Microsoft based products over a diverse set of users within a large enterprise setting.  

In support of this effort, VA is soliciting white papers that address functional capabilities, per seat costs, security, and interoperability with current applications.

<DESC>Request for Information
Cloud Based Office Automation and Collaboration Pilot
	 
This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice issued in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) to conduct market research. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The VA is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

VA currently owns and operates Microsoft based office automation and collaboration products including Microsoft Office 2003, 2007, 2010, Office Communication server 2007 R2, and SharePoint Server 2007, and 2010.   This allows interoperability across the enterprise between these applications.  In support of the US Federal Chief information Officer's  Cloud First Policy as delineated in the 25 POINT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO REFORM FEDERAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT, VA Office of Information and Technology intends to solicit proposals for secure off-premise cloud based office automation and collaboration services  and tools that will be piloted in 2012/13.   Pilot efforts will be 6-12 months in nature. Cloud based office automation includes, email, word processing, presentation creation and delivery, data base, and spreadsheet.  Collaboration tools include real time instant messaging, endpoint to endpoint audio conferencing that includes screen sharing, collaborative writing or document editing.   Collaboration also includes user controlled web portals and information sharing web sites/web based applications similar to Microsoft SharePoint.
These tools should have : 
"	Off Premises Cloud services to the VA at FISMA High or FISMA Moderate with additional Mitigating Controls that are satisfactory to the VA
"	Off Premises Cloud services with the ability to limit the access to  only authorized VA personnel accessing through the VA's Citrix Access Gateway (CAG) or provide similar controls for limiting the download of files without requiring the use or expense of VA's Citrix Access gateway (CAG)
"	Single Sign-On (SSO) Solution that utilizes the VA's Active Directory for access control 
"	Allows VA access to additional licenses as needed at a flat monthly or yearly rate
"	Provides the VA administrative controls so the VA can, by site, individual, service type, document type, , and other granular options restrict data access and ability to download files
"	Enforce FIPS 140-2 certified  encryption of data transmission to users
The purpose of the pilot/s is to evaluate the potential architectures, understand the issues such as security, interoperability, ease of use, end user satisfaction, speed, Networking need and compatibility with Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 and 2010, Office communicator 2007 R2 and SharePoint 2007, 2010 based products, over a diverse set of users within a large enterprise setting. 

In support of this effort, VA is soliciting white papers that address capabilities, per seat costs, security, and interoperability with current applications.   The white papers should merely be focused on the per seat cost for services/tools provided, current state of the technology in terms of Office Automation and collaboration benefits, security, FIPS and FISMA compliance, ease of use, and interoperability with Microsoft based products.  Submit a white paper or related information via email to the Project Manager for this effort at (TBD) by 4:00 Eastern Standard Time on 15 March 2012.  Please limit the white papers to 20 pages.   All proprietary/company confidential material shall be clearly marked and every page that contains such.  White papers should also include a short summary of your company's business/developments in this area and current deployments. Also, please submit the name, phone number, and email address of the lead from your organization.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Specific Government Requirement for the Department of Defense only, following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-01-598-1946	<br />Name:		Ice Melt/De-Icer, 10 lbs.<br />Description:	Granular ice melt pre-coated with chemicals to create a corrosive deicing compound. UoI is BX. BX = 10 lbs.</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-01-598-1926<br />Name:		Ice Melt/De-Icer, 20 lbs.<br />Description:	Granular ice melt pre-coated with chemicals to create a corrosive deicing compound. UoI is BX. BX = 20 lbs.</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-01-598-1933<br />Name:		Ice Melt/De-Icer, 40 lbs.<br />Description:	Granular ice melt pre-coated with chemicals to create a corrosive deicing compound. UoI is BX. BX = 40 lbs.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Richmond, VA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-01-598-1946	<br />Similar Items:	None Reported</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-01-598-1926<br />Similar Items:	None Reported</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-01-598-1933<br />Similar Items:	None Reported</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 5, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>Notice Type: Special NoticeJ&A Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1 ? Only one responsible sourceModification Award Date: June 4, 2012Contract Number:	DE-AC05-07OR23193
Classification Code: S?Utilities and housekeeping servicesNAICS Code: 561 ? Administrative and Support Services 561612 ? Security Guards and Patrol Services
NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE MODIFICATION
The United States Department of Energy (DOE), Oak Ridge Office, intends to award a sole source modification to existing contract number DE-AC05-07OR23193 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, 41 USC 253(c)(1), to G4S Government Solutions, 7121 Fairway Drive, Suite 301, Palm Beach Gardens, FL  33418-3766 for continued protective force support services across the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR).  The current contract with G4S is scheduled to expire on June 3, 2012.  The proposed modification will be for a 180-day extension and will include an option to incrementally extend services up to six months thereafter, if needed.  The modification will ensure the continuation of vital services under the existing contract until a new competitively sourced five-year contract is awarded.  The DOE National Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA) Business Services Division (BSD) is currently soliciting proposals for a new five year contract.  The BSD anticipates an award of the follow-on contract by Septem ber 30, 2012, plus a two-month transition period.  These dates, however, are subject to change.
G4S, by virtue of being the incumbent contractor, is the only responsible source for the modification to extend the current contract.  The execution of the modification will prevent any potentially adverse impact to the mission of the agency, which would occur in the event of interruption or disruption of the work presently being performed.  The mission of the ORR requires the maintenance and administration of a highly specialized, extremely focused, intensive, efficient, and effective security protection program.  G4S currently provides highly trained Security Police Officers and Special Response Teams to protect the ORR and has the appropriate high level security clearances to perform this work.  To attempt to do a stop-gap short-term contract to cover these requirements, pending the award of the follow-on five-year contract, is not feasible because the three-tiered transition (from incumbent to short-term contractor to follow-on contractor) within a span of a six to twelve  month period would potentially disrupt the protection of the ORR to an extent that would put national security at risk.
The statement of work for the modification is to remain the same as under the current contract.  G4S will continue to provide mission critical protective force support services for the ORR.  Continuous protective services are required 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  The applicable NAICS code is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services, with a size standard of $18.5 million.
This is a notice of intent to award a modification under an existing contract and is not a request for quotes or proposals, and no solicitation is forthcoming.  The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement by March 5, 2012, 2:00 PM Eastern Time, to Mary Lou Crow, Contracting Officer, Oak Ridge Operations, P. O. Box 2001, Oak Ridge Tennessee or by e-mail at crowml@oro.doe.gov.  Responses to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government and would not jeopardize the security interests of the ORR.  DOE will not be responsible for any costs incurred from responding to this Notice.  This Notice in no way obligates the Government to award any modifications to the existing contract.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network 23 Contracting Office, Minneapolis, Minnesota intends to award a brand name requirements contract in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 17.   The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 325413, In-Vitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing and the size standard is 500 employees

VISN 23 has a requirement for Vitek identification and susceptibility cards. This testing is performed on the Vitek Compact instrumentation. Test cards are proprietary to the equipment; however, this will be a brand name solicitation since the cards are proprietary to the analyzers that they will be used with.   The Government intends to award a firm fixed price requirements contract for a period of one base year and four option years.  Identification and susceptibility cards will be obtained to perform clinical testing for each of the clinical laboratories located at the following VA facilities: 

"	Black Hills Health Care System, Hot Springs, SD
"	Black Hills Health Care System, Fort Meade, SD
"	Central Iowa Health Care System, Des Moines, IA
"	VA Medical Center, Iowa City, IA
"	VA Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN
"	Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System, Omaha, NE
"	VA Medical Center, St. Cloud, MN
"	Royal C. Johnson VA Medical Center, Sioux Falls, SD

 The identification and susceptibility cards must be compatible with and FDA approved to operate on the Vitek Compact instrumentation platform.  Orders received must be the same lot number per shipment per site for reasonable QC purposes. When used according to manufacturer's specifications must meet the performance characteristics and quality assessments as defined by the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act.  

All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by The Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO23, Minneapolis, Minnesota.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. 

Any company that feels they have items that meet the needs of the Government must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim. The information must explain the company's ability to overcome propriety information and compatibility with existing instrumentation.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

All questions should be addressed to Jim McDavitt via email at james.mcdavitt@va.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Omicron Nanotechnology USA of Eden Prairie, Minnesota for the purchase of replacement components for its Omicron Nanotechnology ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy system under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br />&nbsp;
<p>NIST currently owns an Omicron Nanotechnology ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy system in its Physical Measurement Laboratory. A direct replacement for the STM controller system and one of the three integrated microscopes is now required. Both the required STM control system and the UHV VT STM XA 650 microscope must be drop-in components completely compatible with NIST's extensive, existing equipment both from Omicron Nanotechnology (Omicron) and the custom hardware NIST designed to utilize sample handling specific to this Omicron system. In addition, since the system will retain two UHV STM microscopes manufactured by Omicron, the replacement of the control system with one from Omicron is essential to ensure compatibility.</p>
<p>Omicron Nanotechnology is the only contractor who can provide the STM controller and UHV VT STM XA 650 microscope required in order to meet NIST's requirements. Therefore, Omicron Nanotechnology is uniquely qualified to provide the required ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy system components.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (EST) on March 2, 2012. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with NRMP, Inc., of St. Louis, MO , for the development and certification of radioactivity standards reference materials (RSRMs) under other than full and open competition. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:
<p>***The (see excerpt below) primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br />1. Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -<br />(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or <br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. <br />***** This requirement is for the development and continued certification of radioactivity standard reference materials. These particular SRM's are unique as they are essential for calibration and measurement assurance programs in the field of nuclear medicine. NRMAP, inc. is the only company that can produce the SRMs in a timely manner. Any other company would necessitate significant research and development and cause undue difficulties and delays (which the Government estimates would be at least one year) for NIST.<br />As a result NRMAP, INC. is uniquely qualified to meet the Government's needs.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990, and the size standard is $12 M.<br />No solicitation package will be issued.

<SOLNBR>VCP1
<CONTACT>Ronald W. Backes, Ombudsman, Email acquisition@treasury.gov
<DESC>Access to current market information is critical for Treasury program managers as they define requirements and develop acquisition strategies. Treasury encourages productive interactions between federal agencies and our industry partners to ensure a solid understanding of the marketplace and to negotiate and award contracts for effective solutions at reasonable prices. Early, frequent, and constructive engagement with industry is a fundamental practice when planning Treasury's high impact acquisitions. Conversely, inadequate industry engagement in the acquisition planning process can impact the clarity of Treasury's needs and the effectiveness of Treasury's contracts. Artificial barriers to engagement often stem from an abbreviated planning horizon or from misconceptions among members of the acquisition community about appropriate vendor communications. <br /><br />The Treasury Vendor Communication and Outreach Plan identifies the steps Treasury has taken and will continue to take to reduce any unnecessary barriers to vendor engagement, publicize opportunities for Treasury to communicate with industry, and prioritize engagement opportunities for Treasury's high impact acquisitions. Implementation of this plan will enhance communication with and engagement of industry, including small businesses and businesses not previously engaged with Treasury contracts, through a campaign to optimize acquisition planning, community awareness, and vendor outreach. Treasury is committed to the principles of openness and fairness and will work together with our industry partners to increase the transparency of the acquisition process while protecting non-public information. By enhancing vendor communication and engagement, and increasing the level of involvement of small and emerging businesses in Treasury contracts, this plan is intended to promote efficient and effective Treasury operations and reinforce public trust.
<p>The plan can is available on the Treasury Website at: http://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-of-the-Procurement-Executive.aspx</p>

<DESC>This announcement is for information only.  The Syracuse VA Medical Center intends to award a contract for Architect/Engineer (A/E) Design Services to "Replace Sprinkler Shut-Off Valves".  The Medical Center will use the short selection process defined in FAR 36.602-5 (a).  As such, VA intends to evaluate the technical qualifications of all A/E firms on file who have responded to competitive solicitations over the past 12 months and identify the three most highly qualified to perform this work.  The geographic range being considered for this selection is 150 miles from 800 Irving Avenue, Syracuse NY, and only firms on file within that range will be considered.  Existing information on file indicates that the only potential socio-economic set-aside within this geographic radius is 100% small business set-aside.  If evidence of three service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB) or veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB) can be identified, however, a set-aside to these socio-economic categories will be considered.  Firms wishing to be considered who are within the 150 mile radius but have not submitted a technical qualifications package within the past 12 calendar months may submit a package to the attention of Duane Schumacher, Contract Specialist, Syracuse VA Medical Center, 800 Irving Avenue, Syracuse, NY  13210.  Firms who have previously submitted qualifications need not resubmit.  SDVOSB and VOSB A/E firms, with a working office within a 150 mile radius of Syracuse New York are encouraged to submit  Standard Form (SF) 330's for consideration, listing qualifications.  SF 330's must be received at the Syracuse VA Medical Center by close of business, March 5, 2012.

To design a project to replace all sprinkler shut-off valves throughout the Syracuse VA Medical Center (SCI addition excluded).  This will require the replacement of approximately 200 valves ranging in various sizes. This design will identify and replace all sprinkler valves that are currently in use. Some inaccessible valves replacement will require but not limited to the relocation and replacement of plumbing lines, duct work, electrical conduit, and masonry block and gypsum walls. Many of the valves were installed over twenty and even fifty years ago and do not operate or operate at best only marginally and unreliable. 
Of great consideration and one of the largest obstacles the designer must overcome in the replacement of the valves is how this work can be done with minimal impact to safety and the overall operation of the medical center. 

All work shall be done in strict compliance with applicable NFPA codes.
A.	   Investigative services shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
1.	Review VA program requirements and project scope to determine the equipment and construction criteria and provide preliminary plans, drawings, and estimates.
2.	Prepare measured drawings for area of work.
3.	Perform mechanical, electrical, structural, civil, architectural and asbestos abatement investigation of the existing facility as necessary including full on site investigation to verify existing conditions as it pertains to this project.
4.	Provide for approval a detailed plan of the proposed concept for replacement of the valves with minimal impact to the medical center.

B.	Design services shall include, but not be limited to, providing complete working drawings, specifications, and detailed cost estimates.  Numerous and extensive meetings with various VA employees, in order to fully understand the functional needs, carefully review the space selected for this project, then prepare construction cost estimates, designs and construction contract documents as described herein.  Design services for asbestos abatement, if found to be required at any time during the project shall be included.  Asbestos Monitoring services during construction if required will be required of the A/E.  Additional fees for asbestos design and monitoring will be added to this contract by amendment, if required.  Design services shall include infection control design in order to be in compliance with the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) Environment of Care Standards

<CONTACT>Patricia A. Watson, Contract Specialist , Email patricia.watson@whs.mil - David L. Price, Contracting Officer, Email David.Price@whs.mil
<DESC><p>This is not a request for quote - This is a notice of the Government's intent to extend the period of performance of contract HQ0034-11-C-0063 for the continuation of mission critical Information Technology (IT) services for the Office of General Counsel (OGC) and the Defense Legal Services Agency (DLSA).</p>
<p>Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) Acquisition Directorate intends to exercise Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52-217-8, Option to Extend Services to extend the performance period of contract HQ0034-11-C-0063 issued to Advanced Systems Development Inc. (ASD), on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>The current period of performance, with no additional services added to the Performance Work Statement (PWS), will be extended from 22 March 2012 through 22 July 2012. The scope of the services include Enterprise IT Policy and Planning, Integrated Solutions Management, Product Integration, Security Engineering Certification and Accreditation, Operations Support, software and Managed Services.</p>
<p>Actions are underway to award a new task order under the Net-Centric Integrated Enterprise Information Technology Solutions (NIEITS) Multiple Award Contract (MAC) solicitation, HQ0034-10-R-0046. WHS AD has established a milestone of completing the follow on task order award within three (3) months of the extension.</p>
<p>ASD, Inc. is the only source that can provide uninterrupted service with no degradation in support within the timeframes discussed in this memorandum as they hold critical knowledge and expertise, which are vital to the continued operations of the IT infrastructure, business applications, and processes, while the Government completes the awards for the follow-on acquisition. If this extension is awarded to a new contractor, major disruptions will occur as the new contractor learns to operate and maintain the numerous unique and specialized applications within a very short period of time and for a very short period (i.e., three months). <br />This extension is necessary in order to maintain continuity of vital mission essential recurring services for information technology systems and business applications, affecting operations of OGC/DLSA pending the competition and award of the follow-on services via the NIEITS MAC.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition pending award of the follow-on contract would be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be extended without further notice. Interested parties may identify their capabilities with respect to this requirement by Friday, 2 March 2012, at 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. All information received will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541513 with a size standard of $25.0 million.</p>

USGS scientists in the Pacific Coastal and Marine Program perform studies of bottom sediment transport. A significant part of this work requires the accurate and proper sampling of wave and current data in a wide variety of environmental settings. To achieve this goal, the USGS ? PCMSC uses acoustic doppler current profilers (ADCP) in all of its field studies. Upcoming projects will require an instrument capable of making extremely highly accurate measurements at a high data rate for studies of turbulence in the coastal ocean. In order to make these measurements of turbulence using an ADCP the instrument must be configured with four acoustic beams in an orthogonal, or ?Janus? arrangement, with a 5th beam oriented vertically. The instrument must also be able to provide a single-ping accuracy of 13cm/s or less while collecting data in 25cm vertical bins at a rate of 1Hz or better. In addition, the instrument must be able to be upgraded to provide higher resolution pulse-coherent measurements, thus providing single ping accuracies up to 1cm/s with 7cm vertical bins at a 1Hz or better rate.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman - Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman - Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

   (s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:
 
     (1) The schedule of supplies/services.

     (3) The clause at 52.212-5.
 
     (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
 
     (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
 
     (6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
 
     (7) The Standard Form 1449.
 
     (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments
 
     (9) The specification.
 
   (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
 
     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<SUBJECT>Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Requesting Rapid Fielding Proposals
<SOLNBR>DAC-FY12-BAA0001
<RESPDATE>032312
<CONTACT>Dan Cundiff, Email defensechallenge@osd.mil - Paul Frichtl, Email defensechallenge@osd.mil
<DESC>The Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program was established by Congress (Chapter 139 of Title 10 USC, 2359b) to increase the introduction of innovative and cost-saving technologies and products into existing Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs. The DAC Program is managed through the Office of Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology &amp; Logistics), Rapid Fielding, Comparative Testing Office. DAC provides any person or activity within or outside the DoD the opportunity to propose alternative technologies and product improvements. Opportunities known as "Challenge Proposals" proposed at the component, subsystem, or system level of an existing DoD acquisition program, will be evaluated for resulting improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program. DAC Proposals will be evaluated under the guidelines and criteria outlined in Title 10 USC Section 2359b, Defense Acquisition Challenge Program. <br /><br />This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is open to any technologies, products, or processes demonstrating a near-term potential to improve existing DoD acquisition programs that address the specific operational areas outlined below. Preference will be given to those technologies and products that "challenge" an incumbent and have the potential to be applied within 6-12 months after contract award, with highest priority given to proposals that demonstrate near-immediate transition to operations/production at the completion of evaluation. To meet this time-line the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of technologies or processes proposed must be TRL 7 (a working prototype demonstrated in a relevant or operational environment), TRL 8 or 9 (qualified through testing or ready for production) by completion of DAC testing. The following operational areas (not listed in priority) are focus areas for US Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, Special Operations Command, or other Defense Agency activities engaged in Overseas Contingency Operations: Hostile Fire/Aircrew Protection (small arms &amp; man-portable air-defense systems); Extended Range Small Arms; Improved Unmanned Systems &amp; Sensors (Autonomous, Portable, Air, Ground, and Underwater); Tactical Unit Field Medical Capabilities; Decision Support/Cognitive Assistance for Operational Planning; Enhanced/Lightweight Soldier Protection &amp; Cooling; Space &amp; Situational Awareness; Improved Efficiencies/Alternative Power Sources &amp; Synthetic Fuels; Trusted Cell Phones with Improved Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP); Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) turrets with improved SWaP; Live, Virtual, Immersive, Mobile and Adaptable Training; Non-Lethal Weapons; Fast Craft "Swarm" Protection; Underwater Craft Detection; Sea-Mine Neutralization; Man-Portable Electronic Countermeasures; Low to No-Metal Signature Mine/Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Detection/Defeat; Expeditionary Forensics; Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Robotics; Personal Small Arms Fire Detection; Standoff Suicide Bomber Detection; Tunnel Detection; Composite and Alloy Structures; Aircraft Sensor Fusion; Blue Force/Red Force Battlefield Tracking; Proactive Information Assurance; Vehicle Restraint &amp; Occupant Protection Systems; Affordable Precision Munitions; Scalable Effects Munitions; Extended Range Munitions; Parasitic Weight Reduction; Infrared Signature Reduction; Detection of Low Observables; Improved Hearing Protection; Cyber Defense; Counter Anti-Access and Area Denial; Counter-Proliferation; Ordnance/Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) Detection, Identification, Safing, and Disposal; Urban/Cultural Geospatial Situational Awareness; Frequency Spectrum Management and Optimization; and Chemical-Biological Protection/Detection Capabilities. Proposals that specifically address solutions for acquisition programs experiencing a Nunn-McCurdy breach will be given consideration if they address any design, engineering, manufacturing or technology integration issue causing said breach and satisfy all other DAC legislative requirements identified in Title 10. Additionally, appropriate priorities will be given to those proposals from businesses that are not major contractors with the DoD. <br /><br />The full review and evaluation of proposals will be conducted in two phases. In the FIRST PHASE, any person or activity within or outside the DoD interested in participating must submit an Initial Proposal via the website: https://cto.acqcenter.com and attach a Quad Chart using the most current Quad Chart format under "Reference Materials" on the website. Although not required in this first phase, a letter of support/endorsement from the Service/USSOCOM Program Management Office or Program Executive Office responsible for the acquisition program can be electronically submitted with the proposal. All correctly completed proposals will undergo a panel review. Evaluation criteria for selection in this phase include at a minimum: (A) whether the proposal has merit; (B) whether the proposal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposal could be implemented in the existing acquisition program rapidly, at acceptable cost and minimal disruption. Initial Proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above, and any additional evaluation criteria deemed appropriate for project selection, will be prioritized based on potential for providing innovative and cost-saving technologies or products into existing DoD acquisition programs and ability to meet warfighter needs. The DoD program manager of the acquisition program of record (POR) identified as the most likely to benefit from the proposed technology or product will be asked to conduct a technical review of the proposal. The DoD Program Manager, with input from the prime system contractor on the program, as appropriate, will decide whether to accept the proposal and further refine/develop the proposal for submittal as a Full Proposal for the SECOND PHASE. The DoD Program Manager will determine the scope of the DAC project to include validation/qualitative or comparative testing based on market evaluation, acquisition best practices and program need. In this second phase the Proposals submitted by Program Managers are prioritized and compete for DAC funding to test the proposed technology. In addition to the required areas completed on the initial DAC proposal submission, the Full Proposal must include: key performance parameters (technology/product/process objectives); test concept and schedule for the test planning, administration, and data analysis; a plan for integration (to include cost and schedule) of the technology or product into the acquisition program; estimated vendor support costs; test article cost; projected facility/laboratory/test range costs; Quad Chart and a Project Chart (using the most current formats under "Reference Materials" on the website), with cost category summary for the test and evaluation of the technology/product/process for the intended application. The integration plan must include all applicable certifications (safety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technology/process into the acquisition program. Letter(s) from the DoD acquisition authority expressing intent to procure, or the weapon system prime expressing intent to incorporate, pending successful testing, are required for the Full Proposal. By law, DAC funds can be used to purchase test articles and related test costs only, and cannot be used for full rate production. At the completion of the Second Phase a Government-led evaluation team will review all competing proposals and assess each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b and those criteria deemed appropriate for project selection. The Second Phase Government review of the Proposals will include all criteria listed above, as well as: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likelihood of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in an acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with the challenge proposal. Proposals will be selected for funding based on their assessment rating and the availability of Government funding. Selection for funding is highly competitive. Every attempt will be made to ensure that all submitters are notified of the outcome of their challenge proposal(s). <br /><br />Although selections may be made at any time after the close of the BAA, we anticipate complete the deliberate proposal review and selection for the FY 2012 funding by 1 June 2012. All submissions into the Defense Acquisition Challenge website must be UNCLASSIFIED. Classified submissions, up to SECRET, can be accepted through the mail. Classified responses must be appropriately marked, sealed and mailed in accordance with classified handling procedures. Classified proposals must adhere to the same proposal and Quad Chart formats provided on the website. Email defensechallenge@osd.mil for mailing instructions. Classified documents must be mailed and received by the applicable due date and time. Classification does not in any way eliminate the offeror requirement to comply with all instructions in the BAA. Notification of rejections will be emailed to the proposal submitter. It should be assumed that the reason a proposal was not considered for further review was due to failure to meet the requirements for DAC. <br /><br />This should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. Persons submitting proposals are advised that only a contracting officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds. This BAA and two-phased evaluation process meets the requirements for fair and open competition. However, the final determination for contract award resides with the DoD contracting officer from the sponsoring organization. Proposals must be received at the DAC website NLT 1700 hours EST, 23 March 2012. Proposals submitted after the deadline will have to be submitted as an UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL and may result in the proposal not being considered for funding during the initial selection cycle. All proposal submissions must comply with the submission guidelines and use the templates provided on the website. Failure to comply with the above instructions may result in the rejection of the proposal during the administrative review. The agency posting this announcement, Washington Headquarters Services / Acquisition Directorate / Enterprise, Technology, Logistics &amp; Research Division, is not responsible for the DAC program and therefore cannot answer submitter questions or accept proposals.

Army Contracting Command, Natick Contracting Division in support of Product Manager Force Protection Systems (PdM FPS) has a requirement for Systems Engineering and TechnicalAssistance (SETA) contract to provide personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services. The objective is to provide SETA support to PdM FPS during all phases of pre-acquisition, technology development (TD), engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) production and deployment, and operations and support for Force Protection/Physical Security Equipment (FP/PSE) development/non-development programs and projects to assure the development process is fully integrated with respect to design, test and evaluation, production, operation and logistic support. The primary mission of PdM FPS is research, development, acquisition (RDA), and the commercial product evaluation of FP/PSE under purview of the Army pursuant to DoDI 3224.03. In addition, PdM FPS is responsible for: centralized management of PF/PSE for US Army users, joint service applications, and actions required to type classify such equipment developed by other services or Federal agencies for which a stated U.S. Army requirement exists; and assistance to other Services and Federal Agencies in the development and acquisition of FP/PSE systems. This includes support to the DoD Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG) and its associated working groups such as the Interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG). The following Technology Development (TD), Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Other Procurement Army (OPA) funded programs/products are currently being managed or supported by PdM FPS to meet DoD specific requirements: Integrated Commercial Intrusion Detection System (ICIDS); Mobile Detection Assessment Response System (MDARS); Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System(BAIS)(AN/PRS-9); Lighting Kit, Motion Detector (LKMD)(AN/GAR-s); Force Protection Suite Project; Entry Control Point (ECP) Project; Non-Intrusive Inspection System (NIIS) Project; Rapid Deployment Integrated Surveillance System (RDISS) Project; Automated Installation Entry (AIE) Project and planning and execution of DoD Force Protection Equipment Demonstrations (FPED). Emerging requirements for which SETA support would be required include Integrated Ground Security Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C); Tactical Security System (TSS); and Tunneling Detection. The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) in which Task Orders may be issued and will be for a one year base period, a first option period of one year and a second option period of three months. The Government will award to the Offeror whose proposal offers the best value in terms of Technical Ability, Past Performance, and Price.<br>The Government envisions Firm Fixed Price task orders. The guarantee minimum is anticipated to be $2,500.00 for the length of each task order (base year) and the cumulative total of all Task Orders awarded will not exceed $49,062,064.65 over the life of the contract. The Government envisions that a single award will be made; however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make multiple awards, if in the best interest of the Government. If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or only one successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to reopen the solicitation. This will be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside. NAICS Code 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, applies with a small business size standard of $7,000,000. Proposals shall be due no later than 2:00 pm on 2 March 2012.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br><br><br>The solicitation number is W911QY-12-R-0006 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-53, effective July 5, 2011. This will be a full and open competition to provide a Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW) that will be used to decontaminate sensitive equipment (such as weapons system optics and electronics) and non-sensitive equipment under NAICS code 325998 -- All Other Miscellaneous Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing. <br><br>The small business size standard is 500 employees. Multiple awards are anticipated. The number of awards will be dependent upon the number of Offerors with qualifying products and available funds. Any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 12. Funds are not presently available for this acquisition. No contract award will be made until appropriated funds are made available. Contract award(s) resulting from this solicitation are subject to availability of funds. <br><br>The Attachments listed in this solicitation may be downloaded from the ASFI website: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi and from the Natick Contracting Division website https://www3.natick.army.mil. The Government intends to award a contract(s) WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS with Offerors, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be necessary in the best interests of the Government. <br><br>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:<br><br>This solicitation is for the provision of all labor and expertise necessary to provide a Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW) in accordance with the requirements of this solicitation. The JSEW concept represents an individual product or kit (e.g., wipe, gel, spray, and ancillary equipment such as glove(s), sponge(s), towel, etc) intended to decontaminate sensitive and non-sensitive equipment, which can be easily carried by the warfighter during decontamination operations and/or while conducting missions that may require decontamination to be performed. The following product characteristics are desired: <br><br>- Commercial products with the ability to decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination from 10 g/m2 to 1 g/m2 in support of thorough decontamination on sensitive and non-sensitive equipment. <br>- Commercial products that can be applied directly to equipment surfaces and capable of removing gross contamination within five minutes following application. <br>- Commercial products that are available in durable packaging that can be easily opened by a Warfighter wearing Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 4. <br>- Products that are non-hazardous, non-flammable and inherently safe, minimizing hazards to both personnel and the environment, and that do not produce uncontrollable residual hazards during the decontamination process. <br>- Products that do not cause material/equipment degradation when used to decontaminate sensitive and non-sensitive equipment. <br>- Products that do not cause false positives/negatives for fielded tactical detectors. <br>- Products that do not degrade military relevant Individual Protection Equipment (IPE) or the effectiveness or ability of fielded decontamination products.<br><br>Each JSEW, in its designed configuration of components, must perform the functions necessary for successful completion of the JSEW mission, meet all of the physical characteristic requirements in the Performance Specification (PSPEC) (Attachment 4) and decontaminate chemical agents on sensitive and non-sensitive equipment to the efficacy levels specified in the PSPEC. Potential solutions for JSEW include, but are not limited to, a wipe impregnated with a decontaminant; a dry wipe; a decontaminant applied via a wipe and removed with a second wipe; multiple wipes contained in a single package; a spray bottle of decontaminant with some form of removal media; a gel applied to the surface and peeled off, or other configuration that meets the requirements of the PSPEC. The unit of measure in this solicitation is each (EA).

<DESC>EXTENDED TO 2/21/2012 AT 9:00 A.M.<br /><br />PART I-SECTION C&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Section C of Solicitation for complete details)<br />DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT
<p>C.1 PREFACE TO DESCRIPTION, SPECIFICATIONS, AND WORK STATEMENT</p>
<p>C.1.1 Background<br />As mandated by Public Law 89-522 dated July 30, 1966, The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS/BPH), Library of Congress (LOC), provides reading materials in recorded and braille formats to U.S. residents and U.S. citizens living abroad who are unable to use conventional print materials because of visual and physical limitations. Each year, more than 24 million books and magazines are circulated to these groups. Reading materials (books and magazines) are produced by contractors for NLS/BPH, and are distributed to a readership in excess of 500,000 through a network of 132 regional and sub-regional libraries for blind and physically handicapped individuals. States, municipalities, or other agencies operate these organizations. In addition, books are distributed to schools, multi-state centers, and veterans' hospitals throughout the nation and U.S. territories. All services and products are funded by the U.S. Congress through NLS/BPH and are provided to patrons free of charge including mail to and from patrons through the U.S. Postal Service.</p>
<p>NLS/BPH has about 130,000 titles in its collection and adds 2,700 titles (including music titles) annually. Books are circulated to patrons primarily through the mail from their network libraries located in their jurisdictions. Additionally, several magazines are distributed on a weekly, monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly schedule. Also, catalogs, bibliographies, and newsletters are typically distributed on an annual, quarterly or bi-monthly schedule.</p>
<p>C.1.2 User Materials<br />Contractors who produce books, equipment, or other products shall be cognizant of the consumer-responsive nature of the program and that the specifications for these products have been developed to meet the needs of program users. Materials are produced with the readers' needs foremost in mind and improved through constant monitoring and consumer input. Contractors are expected to familiarize themselves with the equipment-handling practices of blind and physically handicapped clientele and ensure that the supplies and equipment produced shall stand up under such use. A high degree of quality workmanship and product reliability is mandated by the product specification.</p>
<p>C.1.3 Policy<br />NLS follows the mandate of Public Law 89-522 for the purchase of books, either in raised characters or in sound reproduction recordings, by giving preference to nonprofit institutions whose activities are primarily concerned with the blind and other physically handicapped persons where bids submitted by such institutions are determined to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>To fulfill the intent of this mandate and in order to receive this preference, a contractor must perform a substantial portion of the work that is represented by the cost of producing the described items, or by making a significant contribution to the manufacture or production of the end item.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products.<BR><BR>(2) Certification.

(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.<BR><BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).

STATEMENT OF WORKSOLICITATION #: P12PS21070
Museum Management PlanKatmai National Park and PreserveAniakchak National MonumentAlagnak Wild River
1.GENERAL:RESPONSIBILITY:  In this one year project, the Contractor shall furnish sufficient technical, supervisory, and administrative skills to insure the expeditious accomplishment of the work specified in this Statement of Work (SOW).  Additionally, the Contractor shall furnish all services, personnel, materials, supplies, equipment, investigations, studies, and travel required in connection with this SOW.
2.PERSONNEL:The Contractor shall provide qualified personnel, equipment and time needed to complete the tasks identified under 'Description of Tasks' below.
3.PROJECT INFORMATION AND BACKGROUND:National Park Service (NPS) Museum Management Plans (MMP) for the Alaska Region are prepared by museum, archival, and preservation specialists, working in close cooperation with park staff and with the park Museum Curator and the Contracting Officer (CO).  The park Section 106 Coordinator will be the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). All plans are reviewed in draft and final form by the park staff.  After the review process is completed and upon recommendation by the Museum Curator and the Park Superintendent, the Regional Director approves the Museum Management Plan.
The museum management planning process and the MMP exists for the purpose of ensuring quality, efficiency, and consistency in museum management programs throughout the Alaska Region of the National Park Service. 
The MMP is a park-specific document that focuses on reviewing, assessing and developing a park's museum program, which must meet two purposes: making museum collections available to the public and preserving the collections. The MMP identifies problems and makes recommendations to improve a park's museum program. Issues that may be examined as part of the MMP include management and planning, care of the collections, documentation, archives and records management, growth and development of the collection, access and preservation. 
The main audience for the MMP includes individuals responsible for overseeing and carrying out the planning, development, and management of museum collections with a particular park.  The audience may include NPS personnel as well as staff from partnering organizations.  The MMP is also a primary document used by a park to describe their museum programs and to define short-and long-term development objectives. 
In the Alaska Region, the MMP replaces the Collections Management Plan (CMP) referred to in the National Park Service publications, Outline for Planning Requirements, Cultural Resource Management Guidelines, and the NPS Museum Handbook, Part I. A CMP generally concentrates on the technical aspects of archival and museum collection management and operations; the MMP typically focuses on larger issues or topics of concern within the park's operation and the museum program as a whole. 
A MMP, like any report, contains several required elements and sections. What makes these elements and sections unique to the MMP is the expert review of the park museum program by the facilitator, other team members, and staff, identifying the specific issues that the MMP will focus on, and the thoughtful review, revision, and the quality product. 

4.OBJECTIVES:
A.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />1.1 PROJECT OVERVIEW<br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Philadelphia District, has been tasked with providing support to U.S. Environmental Agency (USEPA) Region 2 during on-site remediation activity at the Lipari Landfill Superfund Site (Lipari) located on Route 322 in Mantua Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey. Included in the remedial activities at the Lipari site is a slurry wall surrounding a major portion of the landfill, as well as a soil vapor extraction (SVE) system to collect landfill gas. <br /><br />USACE Philadelphia District is in the process of expanding a portion of the slurry wall to encompass additional landfill materials that are presently outside of the slurry wall. As part of this construction work, USACE will need to perform borings and install additional SVE wells and monitor wells at Lipari. The location of the site is shown on Figure 1. <br /><br />This work will require the services of a drilling Contractor to drill borings, collect continuous core barrel soil samples using sonic drilling techniques, and install wells. The drilling Contractor is required to perform all work in accordance with the procedures and schedules approved by the government. All pilot borings and well installation, as well as all other work items in this contract shall be performed in accordance with all local, State/NJDEP, and Federal regulations and guidance.<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide qualified personnel to complete the following major work items under the base contract:<br /><br />Install 7 soil vapor extraction wells<br />Install 2 single cased monitor wells<br /><br /><br />Three options are also included in this contract. These options, if exercised, would require the Contractor to complete the following major work items:<br /><br />Option A - Install 2 single cased monitor wells<br />Option B - Install 1 double cased monitor well<br />Option C - Install 1 additional double cased monitor well<br /><br />The work under this contract consists of furnishing all plant, labor, materials, supplies, and accessories required to accomplish the pilot borings, obtain the required soil samples and install the monitoring wells, together with all other operations incidental to the work, which shall be performed in strict accordance with these specifications and the applicable plans and drawings, subject to the terms and conditions of the contract. The drillers shall have a copy of these specifications with them on the site at all times and shall be familiar with the applicable provisions of the specifications governing the contract work.<br /><br />Drilling and installation of all wells in this contract (7 SVE wells and up to 6 monitor wells) will be performed using sonic drilling techniques with soil samples collected directly from the sonic casing during drilling. <br /><br />Soil core barrel samples will be collected continuously in all borings for both SVE wells and monitor wells and the recovered soil samples will be transferred directly to USACE representatives for identification and processing. The soil samples obtained from the sonic borings will be produced by the driller in polyethylene tubes and properly sealed and labeled before transfer to the on-site USACE representative. These soil core samples will be used to determine the type, nature, and characteristics of the subsurface materials encountered and the extent and conditions of the various materials as they exist to the depths and at the locations specified. <br /><br />Cuttings from the borings and well installations shall be placed in 55-gallon drums provided by the drilling Contractor and sealed with secure lids overnight and when not in use. The drums will be transported by the Contractor to a designated rolloff container within the landfill site for subsequent disposal.<br />

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is issuing this Request for Offer (RFO) for an Enterprise Messaging System (EMS) through a Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Solution.  This notice is being posted in accordance with the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS), Section 3.2.1.3.11, Public Announcements. 
Description of Required Services:
The FAA's current messaging system is a client-server based solution that uses the IBM Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino product lines. Other DOT organizations use Microsoft Exchange.  Support for the FAA is provided under a ten-year contract, currently operating under negotiated extensions.  In conducting its budget, business case, and requirements analyses, the FAA has determined that the traditional client-server approach to its current messaging system does not meet the need to access any data, anywhere, anytime, using any device, in the most cost effective way.  As a result, the FAA is addressing this challenge with its first entry into the cloud by transitioning to a seamless enterprise-wide commercially available cloud messaging service for approximately 80,000 users (about 60,000 FAA users; 20,000 other DOT users).  This first entry point into the cloud will be carried out through a phased approach to assure smooth transitions from a current infrastructure environment to cloud services.  Other additional services, as described in this SOO, will be considered within this context.
Nature of the Procurement: 
This is a full and open competition in which the FAA will evaluate proposals in accordance with the provisions of Section M of the RFO.  Small Business entities must meet the size standard for the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210, "Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services" with a SBA size standard of $25 million for this solicitation.  The FAA is contemplating award of a single contract for a period of performance of seven years (one year base period and six one-year option periods).  
NAICS Code:
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services with a size standard of $25 Million.

<DESC>Z- AG-0356-S-12-0005 Blacktail Trails Construction <br /><strong>Project Location and Directions:</strong> The Blacktail Trails Construction Project is located in the Southern Snowcrests, a popular destination for hikers and stock users. Access is highly dependent on snowpack, and the trail might not melt out completely until mid-July. To get to the project from Dillon go east on the Blacktail Deer Creek Road. Follow the signs to East Fork Blacktail Campground. It&rsquo;s about 30 miles, and takes 1.5 hours. Park at the campground and follow the trail at the end of the campground. Hike up the BLM trail 1808 for approximately &frac12; mile to a creek crossing, ford the creek and continue on BLM until you reach a bear management sign. The Forest Service begins at the sign, and so does the trail work. Excavators may cross the Blacktail Deer Creek on BLM a maximum of 3 times per year. The BLM does not want dirt bikes or other motorized equipment crossing the creek for any reason. Fording Blacktail Deer Creek with a machine might be tricky early in the year. Excavators can also access the trail from the Notch. The Notch is a cabin located in the southern Snowcrests. To get to the Notch travel east from Dillon on Sweetwater Road. Kentucky Street turns into Sweetwater at the edge of town. Follow Sweetwater Road about 25 miles to a turnoff on your right. It is signed. Turn right towards the Notch and continue driving up to the cabin, almost 20 more miles. After the Notch cabin continue on the 2-track &ldquo;road&rdquo; to the actual Notch in the rocks and park. Hike &frac34; of a mile south to the end of the work at Honeymoon Park. Call the Madison Ranger District for directions. There are three trails in this project. Trail #1 is the mainline East Fork of Blacktail Deer Creek from the boundary to the junction with the Snowcrest Trail at Honeymoon Park. Trail #2 is the Two Meadows Trail. Two Meadows can be accessed off of the East Fork Trail approximately 5 miles from the beginning of the work. Trail #3 is the Lodgepole Trail. Lodgepole is signed at one of the creek crossings about 2 miles from the start of the project. The work on Lodgepole is very minimal. <br /><strong>Description of Work.</strong> The project consists of constructing almost 3 miles of new trail, reconditioning of 4 miles of existing trail, and one mile of route location of existing trail. Construction items include clearing and grubbing, turns, drainage structures, sign installation and puncheon construction. Stake refreshing and cleanup are required in this contract. The project is located mostly through sagebrush meadows. The main objective of this project is to pull the existing trail up onto sidehills and away from the creek.<br /><strong>Construction Magnitude</strong>&nbsp;is between $100,000 and $250,000.<br /><strong>Performance Period</strong> is 150 days from the issuance of the Notice to Proceed<strong>.</strong><br />

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center, Housekeeping and Fabric Care Department (HFCD) has a requirement to acquire linen for clinical care. The Statement of Work shall include, but not be limited to, the following: bed linens; patient wear; scrub uniforms; and various other items that are needed in the care of patients. The linens shall be purchased through the issuance of individual Delivery/Task Orders throughout the year, usually monthly, to replace worn and missing linen.
<p>A Firm Fixed- Price, Indefinite- Delivery Indefinite- Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order type contract is contemplated. The Government anticipates the total life of the Contract shall not to exceed 60 months. The base period of performance will be twelve months from the date of award. Thereafter, the contract shall be renewable as provided in FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (MAR 2000).</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Invitation for bid is being issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside and will contain the following North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and Size Standard: NAICS code for this requirement is 313210 and the size standard is 1000 employees or less.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health anticipates that the formal Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be available on or about February 7, 2012 and the pricing shall be provided as part of an on-line Reverse Auction. The IFB will be available under the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site at www.fbo.gov. The Government will not issue a hard copy of the IFB. All interested vendors must obtain the solicitation documents via the FBO web portal.</p>
<p>The IFB requires interested vendors to provide bid samples that meet or exceed the salient characteristics as specified in the statement of work. These samples will be evaluated by the Governments Technical Evaluation Committee and only those vendors whose bid samples are determined to meet or exceed all of the salient characteristics contained in the IFB will be invited to participate in an online reverse auction. In the event a vendor's bid sample fails to satisfy all of the salient requirements, the vendor's bid will be determined non-responsive and shall be eliminated for further consideration.</p>
<p>A reverse auction is a pricing mechanism used by the federal government. The reverse auction will be conducted by a firm that specializes in facilitating reverse auctions. Those vendors who are invited to participate in the reverse auction are then contacted by an enabler who the Government has contracted with to facilitate the reverse auction. The enabler ensures that the vendor's computer equipment is sufficient and then trains each vendor how to participate in the reverse auction. A mock auction shall be is held the day before the actual auction to assure that all participants are fully familiar with the procedures. The enabler shall address all technical questions concerning the reverse auction.</p>
<p>During the auction, the government sets a maximum price to start the bidding. Vendors place their bids electronically and are able to see the current lowest bid. Vendors continue to place lower and lower bids throughout the auction. Vendors will not know the name of the Vendor who has placed a bid but will only see the bid itself.</p>
<p>The reverse auction will be held on or about March 19, 2012. The auction will continue until such time that the bidding stops and a final price is determined. The winning bid will be the lowest overall price for the specified linens and quantities.<br />Any question concerning this pre-solicitation should be submitted via email to the attention of the contract specialist Mr. Brian Lind at lindbj@cc.nih.gov.</p>

In the event that a reasonable, technically acceptable offer is not received in a timely manner from a responsible small business in response to this solicitation, automatic dissolution of the Small Business Set-Aside will occur and proposals for the entire requirement will then be considered. Should set-aside dissolution occur, proposals that exclude the set-aside portion of the requirement may be deemed deficient, and then be excluded from further consideration. Therefore, all offerors are encouraged to submit proposals for both lots, including the lot set aside for small business (Dixon NRTF).
 
LOT 1:  Operations & Maintenance of the Naval Radio Transmitter Facility (NRTF) at Dixon, CA. 
-	Small Business Set-Aside
-	NAICS Code 517919, All Other Telecommunications
-	Size Standard: $25,000,000 

LOT 2:  Facility Operations and Telecommunication Services at locations other than Dixon, CA
-	Unrestricted (Full and Open Competition)
-	NAICS Code 517919, All Other Telecommunications

Total contract duration, including up to five (5) option periods, shall not exceed 60 months. The government reserves the right to extend services for up to an additional six months under FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. In either case, the Government will not synopsize the options when exercised as all options will be evaluated at time of initial award in accordance with FAR 17.206(a).
 

The selection process will be conducted in accordance with FAR Parts 15 and 19. Due to the critical nature of the services to be provided, offers will be evaluated in terms of the Technical Submission (Factor A, including 4 subfactors of equal importance), Past Performance (Factor B), Small Business Utilization (Factor C) and Cost/Price (Factor D). The Non-Cost/Price factors (A, B, & C) are listed in descending order of importance. Non-Cost/Price Factors, when combined, are approximately equal to Cost/Price (Factor D).

It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about March 16th, 2012. The RFP closing date and time will be specified on the RFP and will be no less than 30 days after the issuance of the RFP package.
 The date, time, location, and requirements for any pre-proposal conferences and site visits will be specified in the RFP and conducted during the RFP period. The site visits are projected to occur within two (2) weeks of the issuance of the RFP. 

The RFP including any amendments will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) web site at https://www.neco.navy.mil and will also be available for download at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Offerors wishing to submit an offer are responsible for downloading their own copy of the RFP from these websites and to frequently monitor the sites for any amendments to the RFP. An offerors list will not be maintained by this office. No telephone, facsimile, or paper requests for the RFP package will be accepted.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to incorporate the following:


1.	Request concept papers for Mali and Burkina Faso as described below by 21 March 2012 for first round consideration:  

Mali:
HBHC  $55,000
Proposals are requested to train Malian Armed Forces members and their families on the development and preparation for personal or communal garden projects.  The TBD Partner will engage the community on their roles and responsibility from the projects inception to hand-over. Using community and family gardens to increase nutritional intake of military families infected or affected by HIV can provide military service members not only with the necessary nutrients to support ART regimes, but also significant income generation possibilities.
  Urban and micro  gardening is a low cost sustainable activity that can be replicated in almost any setting with consistent access to water.  Providing patients on ART with nutritional support is crucial for their bodies to adequately support the consumption of their regimens and properly hinder viral replication. 
Development and implementation of the gardens will include but are not limited to: planning the garden with the community, plotting the garden, nursery for transplant, direct seeding, cuttings for transplant, transplant planting, fertilization techniques, micro-gardening techniques, weeding, pest maintenance, harvest, soil prep and maintenance, table gardening. 
All materials used for the creation and cultivation of these gardens will be purchased by the TBD Partner, and handed-over to the community at the completion of the partners intervention.
 The TBD Partner will conduct trainings for community members involved in the gardening project concerning nutrition, income generation, proper storage and preparation of vegetables and small enterprise development.  A minimum of three (5) trainings will be conducted throughout the project with specific attention being paid to nutrition and which vegetables best support proper nutrition.
The program will be monitored by the TBD partner throughout the project from start to finish.  Strategic monitoring and evaluation systems will be put in place by the TBD partner in order to adequately allow for the projects completion and subsequent transition of all project materials to the community in a state at which the community can sufficiently sustain the garden and yields to be consumed and sold.
  
The TBD partner will work with local military officials to coordinate the project placement and execution.  The TBD partner will also collaborate with DHAPP, US Government Agencies, and other implementing partners in their efforts to execute prevention activities and techniques. 
Upon completion of the project the TBD partner will provide a report of the activities completed, the achievements and constraints of the program, and ways forward for future intervention with this program and possible areas of improvement.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

Questions and Answers - Round 1
12/7/2011
1.	Of the items being shipped, are any of them classified as hazardous materials?  If so, is the customer looking to also incorporate the capability of creating electronically validated shipping documents based on mode of transport for the Hazardous Materials to ensure regulatory compliance?    These shipping documents would include Bill of Ladings, International Maritime Declarations of Dangerous Goods, Shippers Declarations of dangerous goods, FedEx and UPS specific Documents, MSDS, Emergency Response forms, Federal and International Permits and Letters, etc.
        A:  Yes, hazardous materials are transported but at a very low frequency and very limited 	  	variety.  No hazardous materials functionality enhancements are envisioned at this time.  	Additional capabilities for accommodating hazardous materials are not required.

<DESC><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has non-competitively increased the maximum task order ceiling by $490,050.00. This notice is posted to meet FAR 8-405-6(a)(2).</p>
<p>Task Order GS-35F-0306J/EP103 to provide Financial Support Services to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer&iquest;s (OCFO) Office of Technology Solutions (OTS) was awarded to Booz Allen Hamilton, Incorporated (BAH) after the contracting officer conducted a fair opportunity competition among EPA&iquest;s 4 Blanket Purchase Agreement awardees and has a 3-year period of performance. The total estimated ceiling value of the task order was $2,397,235.67 and it is incrementally funded. This sole source ceiling increase raises the estimated value of the task order to $2,887,290.67. The additional cost was caused for the most part by Government delays in implementing its new financial management system, and, to a lesser extent, by a change to the EPA&iquest;s time, attendance and payroll system project (TAPM). The contractor&iquest;s continued support services are vital to the Agency&iquest;s functions.</p>
<p>Task Order GS-35F-0306J/EP103 expires on June 24, 2012 and the OCFO OTS support services requirements will be continued under a new competitive task order award.</p>
<p>OCFO OTS submitted a Justification for Other Than full and Open Competition (JOFOC) and the contracting officer approved the JOFOC. In 2009, the CO determined that BAH&iquest;s quoted labor rates were competitive, fair and reasonable prior to task order award. The CO has determined that BAH&iquest;s submitted price quotation for the ceiling increase resulting from the Government delay and OCFO OTS changes to its TAPM project are fair and reasonable for personnel possessing similar education and experience, as well as other Agency contract rates and GSA Schedules.</p>
