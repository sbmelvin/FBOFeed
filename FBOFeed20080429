When requested, the ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above.

The program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Governments inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares and product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1.

Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.

<DESC>Tasks
1.	Accounting Model Enhancements - Support to be provided for continued enhancements to the URGWOM Accounting Model to further improve the efficiency for creating accounting tables and to assist Reclamation with addressing comments from the Interstate Stream Commission (ISC) and other stakeholders.  Further enhancements may also entail improving the efficiency for using the Accounting Model with the Water Operations Module of URGWOM for preparing Annual Operating Plans (AOP).  Enhancements must be made as needed to facilitate development of the Hydrologic Database (HDB) and the use of the Accounting Model with HDB and Crystal Reports for generating accounting reports.  The new RiverWare capabilities for the direct connection with HDB and DSS data files must be used to improve data management for providing inputs to the Accounting Model and post-processing output.2.	Database Work - Support must be provided for updating and maintaining the current URGWOM database with most recent data and data needed for new model development.  This work must be completed in close coordination with the URGWOM Technical Team and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that currently maintains the DSS files that contain model inputs.  This task must include continued database work required with the incorporation of the Middle Valley Rework into URGWOM.  Support for the movement from Solaris RiverWare to PC RiverWare with associated data source DMI changes is also required.3.	Technical Team Meeting Participation - Monthly URGWOM Technical Team meetings must be periodically attended to provide update presentations on completed work and coordinate tasks with the Team.4.	Water Operations Reference Manual - A Pecos Hydrology and Water Operations Reference Manual must be developed that provides a detailed description of: policy for operations, basin water rights, environmental issues, and political constraints.  Issues for different water stakeholders in the basin must be summarized, and available data and modeling tools must be documented.5.	Update Rules and Cleanup Ruleset - This task entails cleaning up the ruleset for the Pecos River RiverWare model to simplify the code and improve the efficiency for simulations.  Specific tasks must include adjusting the rules to fire in reverse order such that flood control rules are not continuously placed back on the agenda to fire during rulebased simulation.  Rules used to identify the flow needed to meet the targets must be cleaned up, and the algorithm for setting CID allotments must be reviewed to determine the need to include water in the river as part of the available supply.  The rating curve for the Avalon outlet works must be updated, and the representation of the 20,000 acre-ft of additional storage in the winter must be reviewed and adjusted as needed.6.	Update Base Inflows and Diversion Data - The historical series for base inflows for the reach from Santa Rosa Dam to Puerto de Luna (PDL) must be updated to extend the series to the present, and the Roswell artesian basin groundwater (RABGW) model must be used to update computed base inflows for the reach from Acme to Artesia through coordination with the Interstate Stream Commission.  The historical record for diversion data must be updated including updates to FSID irrigated acreage as needed for the FSID return flow method in the Pecos River RiverWare model.7.	Develop Model User Manual - A user manual for the Pecos River RiverWare model must be developed that describes all the needed inputs for running the model and key parameters that may need to be adjusted for a simulation.  Instructions for using existing Excel files for post-processing data to create flow duration curves and complete net depletions calculations must be included.

The U.S. Postal Service, (USPS) Supply Management Facilities Portfolio Office is issuing a Qualification Statement for a specific project for Design/Build Contractor firms.  The objectives of the pre qualification are as follows:  (1) Pre qualify design/build contractors on a specific project and identify a sufficient number of highly qualified firms to achieve adequate required competition.

Interested Design/Build Contractor firms must submit a Qualification Statement that clearly demonstrating the following:  (1) Similar and like work performed in the designated area, (2) Contract vehicle and project dollar threshold is established as $70 to $115 million.  The USPS seeks to pre qualify the most highly qualified design/build firms for the stated project or geographical area.

Note:  Contractors currently designated as “Pre Qualified” for the designated area and dollar amounts are not required to submit a qualification package.  Contractor who desire to add this area and or dollar amounts are required to submit a qualification application.


The US Postal Service will select the most qualified Design/Build Contractor firms utilizing the information provided by the contractor in accordance with the Pre Qualification application.  Prequalification is a competitive process, therefore satisfying the minimum requirements contained within the Qualification Application may not guarantee prequalification. Design/Build firms providing verifiable documentation demonstrating superior capabilities in project performance, and experience will receive the greater number of possible points.   US Postal Service, Facilitates Contracting Officer will appoint a committee to evaluate Qualification Statements received by the due date. 

Respondents must have a minimum of five (5) years experience as a Design/Build entity and completion or ongoing of two (2) comparable construction projects within the past five (5) years for projects of $75 million or greater.

In addition to the typical types mentioned, new construction, expansion, major repair, alteration and, phased construction in occupied facilities maybe deemed comparable. Projects that include mechanization and or automation installed by the design builder are preferred and may receive a higher rating. Projects that most closely resemble a USPS mail processing distribution facility in function, structure, systems, etc may also receive a higher rating.

Design/Build firms deemed qualified will be notified for the specified project stated above.   The USPS does not guarantee a specific number of solicitations will be issued during the prequalification period. The USPS at its sole discretion reserves the right to conduct project specific prequalification at any time. Prequalified firms will not be required to re-apply for prequalification. Firms shall be Prequalified for a period of 5 years from the date of notification. Renewal: The USPS, at its sole discretion, may extend a firms prequalification term for an additional 3 years.

<a href="mailto:connie.m.houpt@faa.gov">connie.m.houpt@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is issuing this market survey to initiate industry involvement, to determine if and how many available new DDS-2 Read/Write Compatible (DDS-2, DDS-3, DDS-4) Internal SCSI DAT Drives With 3.5" Faceplates exist (refurbished or used condition will not be considered), obtain price information, and determine the level of competition.
The FAA has a requirement for up to approximately 1,500 new DDS-2 Read/Write Compatible (DDS-2, DDS-3, DDS-4) Internal SCSI DAT Drives With 3.5" Faceplates.  These drives are required for the Digital Voice Recorder System (DVRS) and Digital Voice Recorder Series 2 (DVR2) systems that record Air Traffic voice conversations.  DDS-2 Read/Write capability is required because Air Traffic utilizes DDS-2 tapes in the DVRS/DVR2 program.  Use of DDS-2 Read/Write capability will avoid a required change in recording media before it's projected end of service life of 2013.  These drives are obsolete.  In the past these items have been available from Sony, Hewlett Packard, Quantum, Seagate and Maxell; however, they have discontinued manufacturing of these drives.
Responses to this market survey will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or the 8(a) program in lieu of opening the acquisition up for full and open competition.
The NAICS Code for this requirement is 334112, Computer Storage Device Manufacturing, with a Small Business Size Standard of 1,000 employees.
Interested vendors should respond with the following:
1)	A list identifying quantities and price (incremental pricing encouraged) of currently available DDS-2 Read/Write Compatible (DDS-2, DDS-3, DDS-4) Internal SCSI DAT Drives With 3.5" Faceplates.  The list must identify each specific manufacturer with their manufacturer's part number.2)	DDS-2 Read/Write Compatible (DDS-2, DDS-3, DDS-4) Internal SCSI DAT Drives without 3.5" faceplates (new condition only) may be considered if the responder can offer compatible 3.5" faceplates for particular manufacturers' part numbers of DDS-2 Read/Write Compatible (DDS-2, DDS-3, DDS-4) Internal SCSI DAT Drives.  A list identifying quantities and price (incremental pricing encouraged) of currently available faceplates.  List must specify compatibility with specific manufacturers' part numbers.  3)	Provide a description of the terms and conditions of warranties and the processes and procedures (for each specific manufacturer and manufacturer's part number).  This information is required in order for the FAA to obtain warranty repair service, if required.4)	Complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.   The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
Note:  Multiply awards may be made, as the FAA realizes the number of drives are limited and may not be available from only one vendor.
The FAA prefers that all response submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following address: Connie.M.Houpt@faa.gov   Responses should be submitted in a Microsoft Word (preferred); however, portable document format (i.e. .pdf file) is acceptable.  The FAA will not respond to telephonic inquiries.  Vendors must respond by 4:00 p.m. (CST), May 13, 2008.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these products.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial response.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.
This Notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.

<DESC>The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute seeks an Echocardiography Reading Center (Echo RC) for the Coronary Artery Disease Risk Development in Young Adult (CARDIA) Study renewal project. The CARDIA renewal involves a Year 25 clinical examination (Year 25 Exam) of the cohort that includes repeat and new measures to be performed June 2010 through May 2011; and continued follow-up contact and clinical events surveillance of the cohort through September 30, 2013.  All surviving and willing members of the CARDIA cohort will be followed up by the Field Centers and included in the Year 25 Exam; it is estimated that approximately 3600 participants will be examined. The CARDIA Echo RC’s effort is expected to begin on March 1, 2009 and to end September 30, 2013. The Echo RC contractor will be responsible for the various aspects related to the echocardiographic measurements to be collected and assessed in the Year 25 Exam.
	
The CARDIA Study started as a study of the distribution and evolution of risk factors for cardiovascular disease during young adulthood in black and white men and women.  The Study began recruitment in 1985 in a cohort of 5,115 men and women aged 18-30 years in four communities.  The original cohort had approximately equal representation by blacks and whites, men and women, those aged 18-24 and 25-30 years, and those with no more than and more than a high school education.  The baseline examination (Year 0) was conducted over a 14-month period during 1985-86.  The examination consisted of questionnaires on sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, and psychological factors; an exercise treadmill test; resting electrocardiography; a diet history assessment; anthropometry; pulmonary function testing; and resting blood pressure.  Fasting blood measurements included total cholesterol and its subfractions, insulin, glucose, liver enzymes and other serum chemistry measurements, and hematology.  
	
Six additional examinations have been completed every 2-5 years, including a Year 20 examination completed in 2006. Repeat measurements on traditional risk factors, including plasma lipids, blood pressure, anthropometry, smoking behavior, physical activity, and pulmonary function testing (except Years 7 and 15) have used the same methods at each examination to assess age and secular trends in these factors during young adulthood. In selected years, additional measurements have been made, including a treadmill exercise test at baseline and Year 7; diet history at baseline, Year 7, and Year 20; cardiovascular reactivity measurements in Year 2; echocardiography at Year 5 and in a subset at Year 10; ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (in a subset) at Year 5; skin reflectance and assessment of the experience of discrimination and other psychosocial measures and urine sodium and creatinine in Year 7; glucose tolerance testing and microalbuminuria in Year 10 and Year 20; coronary CT scan in Year 15 and Year 20; and carotid intima media thickness in Year 20.
	
Retention of the surviving cohort was 90, 86, 81, 79, 74, and 72 percent at each of the respective follow-up examinations.  Cohort members are contacted every six months to obtain information on vital status and current residence.  Every other six month contact also includes speaking with the participant to ascertain information on current smoking status, major illness or injury, and hospitalizations.	
	
At the Year 25 Exam (to be conducted from June 2010 through May 2011), participants will be 43-55 years old, when risk factors and subclinical abnormalities become more prevalent and clinical events begin to emerge.  CARDIA offers the opportunity to address aspects of the development and progression of subclinical vascular, ventricular, and pulmonary function abnormalities that cannot be addressed in older cohorts.  The renewal of the CARDIA study will address five objectives: 1) Assess the impact of timing and varying levels of risk factors throughout young adulthood on the development of subclinical ventricular, vascular, and pulmonary function abnormalities in mid-life; 2) Examine young adult antecedents and consequences of obesity and the longitudinal relationships and interactions among adiposity, insulin resistance, and inflammation; 3) Identify determinants and trajectories of subclinical disease development in women during menopause transition compared to men of similar age; 4) Further assess the basis for racial differences in subclinical disease development; 5) Provide a platform for in-depth ancillary studies in cardiovascular and other areas.
	
The technical requirements associated with this acquisition for the CARDIA Echo RC include the following:
1.	Participate in the CARDIA Steering Committee, the Imaging Committee and Quality Control Committee, as appropriate.
2.	Develop the protocol for the acquisition and reading/information abstraction of the echocardiograms to be performed as part of the CARDIA Year 25 Exam.  
3.	Determine comparability of the proposed CARDIA Year 25 echocardiographic measurement to that from the Year 5 Exam by performing repeat measures of about 200 videotaped Year 5 echocardiographic studies plus 10% blind duplicates of the Year 5 echocardiographic studies.  
4.	Propose a plan to assess 20-year changes in echocardiographic measurements, particularly left ventricular structure and function, in the CARDIA cohort.
5.	Convert the videotaped echocardiograms obtained from the CARDIA Y5 and Y10 Exams into digital electronic files and copy onto DVDs for secure archival storage.
6.	Train and certify Field Centers’ echocardiography technicians according to protocol.
7.	Train and certify echocardiography readers at the Reading Center according to protocol, as well as orient professional staff from the Coordinating Center and NHLBI Project Office who have quality assurance responsibilities 
8.	Conduct a pretest of the Year 25 echocardiography protocol, including quality assurance activities, during the pilot testing phase of the Year 25 Exam, in collaboration with the CARDIA Coordinating and Field Centers.
9.	Perform readings/information abstractions of echocardiograms in a timely manner during the pilot phase and throughout the Year 25 Exam period.
10.	In collaboration with the Steering Committee, provide advice on the development of clinical alert values for reporting results to participants. 
11.	In collaboration with the Coordinating Center and Field Centers, provide timely reporting of clinically significant results to participants.
12.	Track the receipt, reading, and storage of echocardiograms
13.	Develop and implement long-term archiving and storage of echocardiograms and timely creation of backup copies.
14.	Visit CARDIA Field Centers during the early phase of the Year 25 Exam and as needed, in support of quality assurance efforts of the study.
15.	Participate actively in data analysis, presentation, and publication using the echocardiographic data.
16.	Prepare and submit technical and financial reports as specified herein.

<SUBJECT>Technical Assistance in support of Design Certification, Early Site Permit, Combined License, Environmental and new reactor pre-application activities related to USAPWR
<SOLNBR>42-08-064
<RESPDATE>061208
<CONTACT>Kala Shankar, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone 301-415-6310, Fax 301-415-5761, Email kala.shankar@nrc.gov - Jeffrey R. Mitchell, Phone (301) 415-6465, Email jeffrey.mitchell@nrc.gov
<DESC>U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates the construction and operation of new commercial nuclear power facilities.  Office of New Reactors (NRO) serves the public interest by enabling the safe, secure, and environmentally responsible use of nuclear power in meeting the nation's future energy needs.  The NRO’s Division of New Reactor Licensing (DNRL) supports the mission to protect public health, safety, and the environment by leading and managing the activities associated with licensing of new nuclear power plants.  Together, NRO/DNRL implements regulations and develops and implements policies, programs, and procedures pertaining to all aspects of licensing and inspection of these facilities.  The NRO/DNRL activities for new reactor licensing will include reviews of U.S. Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor (USAPWR) applications for reactor design certifications (DCs), early site permits (ESP), combined license (COL) applications, environmental reviews, and new reactor pre-application activities.

NRO anticipates the filing of more than 20 COL applications in the next several years and the number is growing.  Included in these applications will be at least one USAPWR design certification and one COL application.  Given this increased workload in new reactor licensing and importance of meeting the schedule of new reactor licensing activities, NRC is seeking Contractor assistance in the preparation and review of these simultaneous applications.   The Contractor(s) shall provide qualified, competent, and fully trained personnel to perform the required technical support activities.

The NRC has developed a strategy, referred to as the Design-Centered Review Approach (DCRA) and referenced in the Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS-07-08), AUpdated Licensing Submittal Information to Support the Design-Centered Licensing Review Approach,@ dated April 16, 2007.  The DCRA is based on a concept of industry standardization of COL applications referencing a particular reactor design such as the U.S. Advance Pressurized Water Reactor (USAPWR).  This approach uses, to the maximum extent practical, a Aone issue, one review, one position@ strategy in order to optimize the review effort, the resources needed to perform these reviews, and the review schedules.  One technical review will be conducted for each reactor design issue and use of this one decision to will support the decision on a DC and on multiple COL applications.  In order for the DCRA to be fully effective, it is paramount that the DC and COL applicants achieve a consistent level of standardization among related COLs.  

Further for the DCRA to be fully effective, it is essential that applicants referencing a particular design standardize their applications to the maximum extent practicable (standardize design features, analyses, assumptions, and methods) such that the technical review and decisions are made against a standard application, known as the reference COL (R-COL) application.  If this is done, those decisions will be applicable to subsequent COL (S-COL) applications that reference the standard.  The NRC=s DCRA uses the DC review or the review of the R-COL as the basis for acceptance.  The DC or R-COL application review will identify those technical areas to be considered standard for a given design.  S-COL applicants who use the standard application and actively work with the R-COL applicant to standardize will significantly benefit from the DCRA and the goal of having Aone issue, one review, one position@ for multiple COL applications.   In order for the DCRA to be fully effective, it is paramount that the Design Certification and COL applicants achieve a consistent level of standardization among related COLs.  The purpose of this solicitation is to seek contractor support for the USAPWR design center. 

The Contractor shall provide support in a wide range of technical and scientific disciplines in accomplishing work related activities aimed at ensuring the overall safety and adequacy of nuclear power plant design, construction, and operations.  Work related activities include design certification, early site permits, combined operating license and pre-application activity.    The scope of work involves placement of task orders in program areas such as DCs, ESPs, COLs and pre-application activity.  
 
NUREG-0800, AStandard Review Plan for the Review of Safety Analysis Report for Nuclear Power Plants,@ and NUREG-1555, “Standard Review Plans for Environmental Reviews for Nuclear Power Plants,” exist for the guidance of staff reviewers. 

It is anticipated that this requirement will result in one contract award.  It is anticipated that the contract will be cost reimbursement type contract.   

The period of performance of the resultant contract will be five (5) years. 
The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about May 15, 2008, and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Government anticipates a single competitive award for a CSD development and production contract.  The contract will consist of a Cost-Plus Incentive Fee/Award Fee (CPIF/AF) development effort (with an estimated period of performance of two years), as well as Firm Fixed Price option line items for CSD production hardware and Cost Plus Fixed Fee option line items for engineering services.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Wayne State University (WSU), 656 West Kirby, 4001 Faculty Administration Building, Detroit, MI 48202-3622. WSU is the only known qualified source to perform this effort. US Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) desires to procure Low Temperature Research services in the study of diesel engine performance under extreme cold ambient conditions. The detailed efforts required include but are not limited to (1) simultaneous chemiluminescence and visible range imaging to study diesel fuel spray behavior during the cold starting events; (2) investigation of potential cold start engine control options toward addressing the various transient combustion regimes that occur during start-up events; (3) examinination of the solid/fluid interaction between the piston assembly and associated lubricating oil film at low temperature operating conditions; and (4) study of the impact of low temperature conditions on the cold starting of a high power density military diesel engine. Market research indicated that WSU is uniquely capable and facilitized to meet TARDEC's research requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. Projected period of performance is eighteen (18) months. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>Request for Information: Subject to final approval, The Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center, Division of Procurement, intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, to Bloomberg Financial L.P., 731 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10022 for the Renewal of Bloomberg On-Line Financial Information Service, for a Base and four Option Years. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  

Nature and Description of Action: The Bureau of Public Debt (BPD) is currently utilizing the Bloomberg On-line financial Information System, and is in need of the renewal of this service for 2008 in order to ensure continued performance. A sole source is intended for this order; no other known source is know that is fully capable and available to provide the required services.

Bloomberg is the online service that Treasury Auction participants and U.S. Treasury policymakers and debt managers use to access historical and prevailing data on U.S. Treasury securities such as real-time pricing, issue information, and WI rates.  The data provided by Bloomberg is proprietary data.  It is absolutely critical that BPD have access to this specific service so that we may monitor and verify the information provided by Bloomberg to auction participants and to ensure the integrity and efficiency of our auction process.   
Bloomberg also provides news and historical data used by offices at BPD to analyze and monitor fixed-income markets.  BPD’s staff have been trained by Bloomberg personnel on the use of the Bloomberg terminal.  Any response should also demonstrate the capability to provide the same level of service and provide user training as cost effectively as renewing services with Bloomberg. 
 
No solicitation document is available. The Bureau of Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 7 days after publication of this notice.  
Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show how it would be advantageous to the government to switch providers for this requirement, etc. software cost, training for employees, contingencies, professional environment, and government securities regulations, (GSRS). A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. 

If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Bloomberg Financial.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The intended period of performance for this requirement is 12 months from Date of Award, plus 4 option years.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), INVITATION FOR BID (IFB), REQUEST FOR QUOTES (RFQ), REQUEST FOR APPLICATION (RFA) OR AN ANNOUNCEMNT OF A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT ASSUME THE GOVERNMENT WILL AWARD A CONTRACT OR PROCEED WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE SOLICITATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS NOTICE IS ONLY FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES.
<p>Based on capability statements received from SMALL BUSINESSES ONLY from this announcement, this acquisition may be solicited as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside or as a full and open competition. The NAICS Code is 541690. All Small Business Concerns, including 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women owned small business are encouraged to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>HHS is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. The Department oversees more than 300 programs covering a wide spectrum of activities.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in the near future on behalf of the, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).</p>
<p>The CDC intends to re-compete the Technical Support for the Advisory Board on Radiation and <br />Worker Health's Review of NIOSH Dose Reconstruction Program contract, CDC contract number 200-2004-03805. Firms that have Conflicts of Interests while perfroming work under the NIOSH ORAU Dose Reconstruction Contract or other inherit Conflict of Interest will not be considered. The draft Statement of Work is attached. Interested parties may view a full spectrum of documents on the program at the NIOSH internet site - http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/.</p>
<p>The CDC Office of Compensation Analysis and Support (OCAS) is responsible for conducting individual dose reconstructions on employees of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies, its contractors and subcontractors, and Atomic Weapons Employers (AWEs) under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA). To support NIOSH's role under EEOICPA, OCAS has retained the services of a contractor to assist in the implementation of a number of major program elements. Under EEOICPA, the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health (Advisory Board), is required to review a reasonable sample of dose reconstructions for scientific validity and quality, assess the methods for dose reconstruction, and review Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) petitions. To support the Advisory Board, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requires the services of a contractor to assist in the implementation of a number of tasks related to independent review of the dose reconstruction process.</p>
<p>Please note that failure to specifically address each of the items below in your capability statement may affect further consideration of your capability to successfully perform the requirement. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail so that the Government can determine the capability of your firm. The capability statement must specifically address ALL of the following information; otherwise no further evaluation of your capability statement will be performed. The capability statement must demonstrate that your organization/company has the skills/qualifications for the following general requirements:</p>
<p>A. Individual dose reconstructions review</p>
<p>The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the reconstruction of dose provides a reasonable estimate of the dose (as needed to adjudicate the claim). The contractor shall evaluate and recommend whether or not the assumptions (individual case assumptions and assumptions applicable to multiple cases) made for dose reconstruction are appropriate and defensible for purposes of this program. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the data from DOE or other sources is of sufficient quality necessary to obtain a reasonable estimate of dose. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the dose reconstruction was performed fairly using NIOSH guidelines and in a manner consistent with other cases.</p>
<p>The contractor shall review all relevant dose reconstruction methodologies and/or procedures employed by NIOSH / NIOSH contractors in conducting individual dose reconstructions and SEC petitions. The contractor shall evaluate whether methodologies and procedures are consistent with requirements under 42 CFR 82 and whether there are sufficient procedures to achieve consistent application of the requirements in 42 CFR 82.</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct one of three different levels of review on the selected cases: 1) Basic Review, 2) Advanced Review, or 3) Blind Review. The method of review will be determined by the Advisory Board. The number of individual dose reconstruction reviews is estimated to be approximately 62 in the first year. It is expected that there will be approximately 30 Basic Review cases, 30 Advanced Review cases and 2 Blind Review cases. The next four years will also involve a review of approximately 62 cases per year. The breakdown of cases will be the same as described for the first year. The Advisory Board shall determine the cases to be reviewed and the level of review. These percentages are subject to change by the Advisory Board based on experience with the review process.</p>
<p>The elements of each type of review are detailed below:</p>
<p>1. Basic Review</p>
<p>A. Review Data Collection</p>
<p>Evaluate whether NIOSH received all requested data for the DOE or AWE site from any relevant data source or repository<br />Evaluate whether the data used by NIOSH for the case was adequate to make a determination with regard to probability of causation.</p>
<p>B. Review Interview and Documentation provided by claimant</p>
<p>Evaluate whether NIOSH appropriately addressed all of the reported work history and events represented by the claimant including but not limited to a) incidents or occurrences, b) actual monitoring practices, c) personal protection practices, and d) work practices</p>
<p>Assure that interview information is consistent with data used for the dose estimate, and if not, evaluate whether reasonable justification is provided.</p>
<p>Review Internal and External Dose Estimates</p>
<p>Evaluate whether all assumptions used in the dose determination are appropriate for a remedial compensation program and whether the benefit of the doubt was resolved in favor of the claimant</p>
<p>Verify dose calculations are appropriate for purposes of determination of Probability of Causation (POC)</p>
<p>Evaluate whether the data were consistent with site radiological monitoring protocols of the time period.</p>
<p>Evaluate the treatment of &lsquo;missed dose' and/or &lsquo;unmonitored dose' if relevant to the case.</p>
<p>The review of each dose reconstruction shall include an evaluation of all relevant portions of the methods and/or procedures used by NIOSH. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>Review the internal and external radiation dose reconstruction technical basis documents,<br />Review of methods for estimating &lsquo;missed dose' and &lsquo;un-monitored dose' (for cases related to monitoring technology and for cases where monitoring was not performed, monitoring data is not available or incomplete or otherwise inadequate), <br />Review of the statistical approaches developed for multiple dose reconstructions,<br />Review procedures used for determining whether data are sufficient to make a reasonable dose estimate, <br />Review methods or procedures used for substituting exposure information for unavailable or incomplete information, <br />Review methods for estimating uncertainty in dose and uncertainty distributions surrounding internal and external dose reconstructions on a facility and time specific basis and evaluate whether the benefit of the doubt was resolved in favor of the claimant where there were uncertainties,<br />Review procedures and questionnaire used for work history phone interview, and<br />Review the NIOSH methods, procedures and performance in evaluating, analyzing and validating all contractor work products.</p>
<p>2. Advanced Review</p>
<p>The Advanced Review will include all task items in the Basic Review along with the additional tasks listed below:</p>
<p>Review Data Gathering</p>
<p>Review the entire administrative record to evaluate if relevant information exists which was not considered by NIOSH.</p>
<p>Review the relevant aspects of the Site Profile as they apply to the individual case and evaluate the adequacy and completeness of the site profile and evaluate whether the information from the site profile is consistent with the information used for the individual dose estimate.</p>
<p>Evaluate whether, to the extent practicable, all relevant sources of data (e.g., DOE, AWE, CDC, Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML), Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC) , Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), External Health and Safety Regulators, Government Accounting Office (GAO) , Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB), Congressional Hearing Records, other research programs, research publications, publications regarding the history of the DOE complex, or administrative/court records) were identified, evaluated and where appropriate, included within the Site Profile database and where appropriate were used in the assessment of the individual dose reconstruction case.</p>
<p>Review Work History Interview and Documentation provided by claimant</p>
<p>Evaluate the effectiveness of the phone interview in ascertaining relevant work history information.</p>
<p>Evaluate whether, for the cases involving survivors, there has been an adequate effort to research co-located workers and other historical records to characterize the individual's work history.</p>
<p>Review Internal and External Dose Estimates</p>
<p>Evaluate whether the dose estimate is consistent with relevant radiological information within the NIOSH site profile (e.g. air monitoring, wipe data are consistent with bioassay results)</p>
<p>Compare case information and assumptions with relevant co-worker case information and assumptions for consistency</p>
<p>3. Blind Dose Reconstruction</p>
<p>Using all raw data available to NIOSH, the independent expert will develop an Interactive RadioEpidemiological Program ( IREP) dose input file that they feel is sufficient to make a determination with regard to POC.</p>
<p>B. NIOSH OCAS &lsquo;Site Profile' and &lsquo;Worker Profile' Review</p>
<p>As part of NIOSH's effort in completing individual dose reconstructions, NIOSH is establishing a &lsquo;Site Profile' database for all covered sites. This database includes records relevant to dose reconstruction other than the personnel dosimetry records (e.g. - process information, characterization information, incident or occurrence reports, summary dosimetric information, etc.). The contractor shall review selected site profiles established by NIOSH to evaluate the quality and completeness of the profiles and the adequacy of the data for purposes of individual dose reconstructions.</p>
<p>The contractor shall review the conditions, processes, practices and incidents at selected DOE and AWE facilities covered under EEOICPA to evaluate the adequacy of the information available in the NIOSH Site Profile. The review should focus on whether the approach used by NIOSH assured completeness of data necessary for purposes of determining individual eligibility for compensation. The review should include a evaluation of whether NIOSH identified, evaluated and where appropriate incorporated all relevant data sources (e.g., DOE, AWE, CDC, EML, NRC, EPA, External Health and Safety Regulators, GAO, DNFSB, Congressional Hearing Records, other research programs, research publications, publications regarding the history of the DOE complex, or administrative/court records) within the site profile. One task in evaluating that the data identification and collection process were adequate may require the contractor to conduct interviews (one-on-one or group) with, employees, employee representatives, advocacy organizations, health and academic researchers and site &lsquo;experts' (those with long standing knowledge of processes, materials, events, and exposures). The contractor may be required to conduct meetings with these individuals or groups at locations near the facilities of interest.</p>
<p>As part of NIOSH's effort in completing individual dose reconstructions and SEC Petition evaluations, NIOSH is establishing a &lsquo;Procedures' database to assist in the performance of such efforts. The contractor shall review selected "Procedures" established by NIOSH to evaluate the quality and completeness of the "Procedures" and the adequacy of the "Procedures" for purposes of individual dose reconstructions and SEC Petition evaluations.</p>
<p>It is expected that there will be 30 "Procedures" Reviews and 6 Site Profile Reviews in the first year and in each subsequent year of the contract</p>
<p>C. Review of SEC Petitions<br />42 CFR Part 83, Procedures for Designating Classes of Employees as Members of the Special Exposure Cohort under EEOICPA of 2000, describes the general procedures to be followed in the review of SEC Petitions. Section 83.15 describes how the Board will consider and advise the Secretary of HHS on a petition.<br />The contractor shall evaluate Special Exposure Cohort petitions as requested consistent with the provisions of 83.14 and 83.15. Such reviews may focus on the availability and reliability of documents and monitoring data as well as an analysis of the methods proposed by NIOSH to accomplish individual dose reconstructions for members of a considered class. In cases where a site profile is available for a site in question the contractor will make use of such a document. In cases where no site profile is available the contractor will need to develop the basic information needed to evaluate the SEC Petition.<br />In some cases it may be necessary for the contractor to interview workers and/or site experts to accomplish this task.<br />At the recommendation of the Board, the contractor may be asked to review either the complete SEC Petition or just an aspect of the petition as designated by the Board.<br />In a given year of contract performance, it is anticipated that the contractor will review three complete SEC Petitions and an aspect or aspects of three other petitions.<br />The Contractor shall note if any staff have current Q Type Security clearances.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance for this contract is 60 months.</p>
<p>Interested organizations should submit their written capability statements by 10:00 a.m. on May 16, 2008 to the Contracting Officer at the following e-mail address: dstaudt@cdc.gov. Any questions must be submitted to the Contracting Officer in writing to the email address listed.</p>
<p>Capability statements will not be accepted after the due date. Page Limit is 25 pages. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE. Capability statements must also include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, and business size and status (e.g., small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women owned small business).</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE NOR OTHERWISE PAY FOR PREPARING ANY INFORMATION SENT OR THE GOVERNMENTS USE OF THE INFORMATION.</p>
<p>Any proprietary information should be so marked. No solicitation is available at this time.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this sources sought is to locate firms that can provide full service maintenance  for Xerox Copier equipment as stated in the SOW
Vendors must possess the capabiity of providing services nationwide.  To respond to this sources sought, please provide your corporate capability statement that specifically addresses this requirement, and provide information that reflects your experience in supporting nationwide maintenance requirements.

BACKGROUND

USDA/FSA, utilizing state-of-the-art Electronic Distribution System (EDS) technology, delivers quality printed products to nationwide customers.  The EDS network is a recognized leader in meeting customer needs by providing high quality, timely, and dependable service.  

FSA operates EDS production centers in 29 locations within the United States and Washington, DC to generate and distribute Federal Farm Program information via the Internet, email and hard copy throughout the United States.  All 29 EDS sites download, store, assemble, and print documents daily, keeping County and State Office information current with Federal regulations and laws.  EDS sites also archive information for reference and easy retrieval.

State and County Offices submit work requests to the EDS locations for a wide variety of information available through the FSA.  Jobs range from PDF documents to most any MS Windows XP or newer version based software format or print file.  This work accounts for a large majority of the information processed at the EDS locations.  EDS is expanding the relationship among other Federal Offices, not only to draw in more work but also to alleviate County and State Office workloads resulting from staff reduction and budget cuts.  These job streams vary greatly as there are no set job-submission standards for State or County Offices.

This Statement of Work (SOW) defines requirements for USDA-FSA’s EDS organization to establish a maintenance contract including supplies on Xerox copier equipment.

<DESC>Support Services To Advance Highway Safety Potential Sources Sought
Potential Sources Sought. This is not a RFP

The Federal highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for an anticipated award to advance highway safety by engaging, partnering with, and obtaining the support of State Departments of Transportation (DOTs), Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), and their staffs to significantly improve the capabilities of the safety community to develop and effectively deliver a national highway safety program, especially within State DOTs but also addressing the needs of non-State owned roadways. 

The specific objectives are to:

• Advance strategic highway safety plans;

•Create strategies to improve the safety of roadway users, especially in those areas where the greatest numbers of traffic fatalities occur (in particular, focusing on strategies relating to infrastructure design and operational improvements in the areas of roadway departure, intersections, pedestrians and speed management);

• Enhance public information and communications sources;

• Advance safety professional training; and

• Improve partnering efforts with other governmental and public safety organizations who work closely with State DOTs and FHWA.

The awardee selected will be expected to have:

• Knowledge of State transportation organizations, their organizational structures, functions and highway safety capabilities;

• Developed and continue to maintain relationships with chief executive officers of State DOTs to provide improved safety benefits to the traveling public;

• Management and technical skills to effectively deliver national safety programs;

• Knowledge of State transportation organizations and programs in support of the FHWA Office of Safety objectives.

A national organization may be in the best position to establish and engage in relationships with State Departments of Transportation and their CEOs. FHWA would, however, like to identify all sources that feel their capabilities are commensurate with the range of qualities and tasks needed and stated in this Notice.

The estimated period of performance for this project is five years. FHWA anticipates a level of effort one full-time professional and 2 part-time staff members per year for the duration of the project.

<DESC>“Initiative for Maximizing the benefit of Passive Adverse event Collection Throughout a product’s life cycle” (IMPACT)

2. INTRODUCTION
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is soliciting information to identify potential approaches to assess the impact of spontaneous adverse event reports on regulatory decision-making throughout the product life cycle.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to identify and learn more about potential research organizations that would be interested in and have the appropriate capabilities to conduct research described below.  This information will then be used to assist the FDA in developing a more targeted and structured Request for Proposal (RFP).

The FDA wishes to express its appreciation in advance to all organizations that choose to provide information in accordance with this announcement.

3. BACKGROUND
A crucial part of FDA’s mission is to perform pre-market and post-market safety and efficacy assessments of human drugs and therapeutic biologics (pharmaceutical products). Clinical trials that lead to formal marketing approval only begin to characterize the safety of a given pharmaceutical product. The collection and analysis of safety data by FDA staff must occur throughout the entire life cycle of the product in order to identify undesirable occurrences associated with the use of pharmaceutical products in humans that could not have been predicted by clinical trial data prior to approval. These undesirable occurrences, called adverse events, must be reported to FDA in order for the agency to carry out its mission of performing post-marketing safety surveillance. 
The 1962 Harrison-Kefauver Amendment to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act required approval of the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and reporting of adverse events to the FDA by the applicants.  The regulations for postmarketing reporting of adverse events are stated under 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulation) 314.80 & 81 for Drugs and 600.80 & 81 for Biologics.  This established the basis for the current system, which is a passive surveillance system. This passive surveillance system is one in which FDA receives adverse event reports from manufacturers, health care professionals and patients.  Most of the reports received by FDA are submitted by the manufacturers and fewer are reported directly by consumers and healthcare professionals. 
Monitoring spontaneous reports to identify early safety signals is a critical part of the FDA’s postmarket pharmaceutical product surveillance program to assure the safety of all U.S. marketed products.   Information received through FDA’s passive surveillance system has also been an important source for other FDA centers and federal agencies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, medical community and stakeholders, and national and international health organizations such as the WHO. 
The FDA has been using passive surveillance as the cornerstone for pharmacovigilance for many years.  In order to fully understand the role of passive surveillance in supporting postmarketing safety evaluation throughout the life cycle of a product, FDA is interested in conducting a formal evaluation of its current passive surveillance system. The results of such an evaluation will be used to determine the most appropriate and effective role for passive surveillance within the armamentarium of postmarketing safety assessment tools. 

4. DESCRIPTION
FDA is launching an “Initiative for Maximizing the benefit of Passive Adverse event Collection Throughout a product’s life cycle” (IMPACT) The first step in this public health initiative is to evaluate the impact of collecting and using spontaneous adverse event reports throughout the product life cycle for detection and characterization of drug safety risks supporting regulatory decisions to protect patient safety.

The FDA held a public meeting on January 29, 2008 to obtain broad input from public and private organizations on the scope, goals, and available methodologies to evaluate the utility of spontaneous adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the Agency.  

At this meeting, panel members reiterated that spontaneous reporting provides valuable information for detecting adverse events, particularly those that are rare.  However, under-reporting, the often poor quality of reports, and the lack of systematic feedback to healthcare providers and consumers limit the full utility of the information.  The panel also discussed that now is a timely opportunity to evaluate the impact of passive surveillance on patient safety as the FDA begins to explore and develop new strategies for surveillance.  In addition, FDA presented preliminary work (see docket) that demonstrated safety-related regulatory actions occur throughout the life cycle of new drug products. This research, however, was not able to address the source of data and/or the evidence (e.g. spontaneous reports and clinical trial data) on which the FDA takes regulatory action.  

This preliminary work has begun to provide some answers.  At the same time, much more work needs to be done.  In order to fully understand the role of passive surveillance in supporting postmarketing safety evaluation throughout the life cycle of a product, FDA is interested in conducting a formal evaluation of its current passive surveillance system. The scope of IMPACT includes, but is not limited to, the following research questions:   

1.	What is the value to patient safety of collecting AEs through a passive surveillance system over the marketed life cycle of a product?
a.	How are these data best used in regulatory decision-making?

2.	How can safety issue identification and subsequent regulatory action be characterized in relation to time elapsed following product approval?
a.	Is this influenced by the type of regulatory action and /or the nature of the safety signal?

3.	What is the role of serious and non-serious outcome reports in safety issue identification and subsequent regulatory action?
a.	How does the role of these report types change over the product’s marketed life cycle?

4.	What is the role of reports by health care professional and consumers in safety signal detection?

5.	Are there any types of AE reports that are not helpful to safety signal detection?

6.	What do we know about non-reported AEs or characteristics associated with non-reporting?


Government responsibilities to support this project will be as follows: 

•	FDA will provide project oversight to facilitate information gathering and coordination of interviews with FDA personnel. Any information supplied by the FDA must all be returned to the FDA at the end of the project.

•	In conjunction with PhRMA, FDA will facilitate access to industry records.

The objective of this RFI is to identify appropriate sources capable of performing this evaluation.

http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/07n0480/07n0480.htm
Docket No. 2007N-0480

After considering all input, the FDA will issue an RFP from outside organizations.

5. ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITY STATEMENT

Hence, the Government is requesting information pertaining to existingsubsystems and/or other component elements that are capable of transporting anddelivering science instrument packages to the lunar surface.  The term existing refersto hardware development levels equivalent to flight spares, engineering units, and/orhigh technology readiness level (TRL3 or greater) hardware that could be flight qualifiedand flown as part of the ILN, anticipated for launch in the 2012-2014 time-frame.  In theevent that flight spares or engineering units are not available, the Government is alsointerested in build to print or scaleable possibilities from existing flighthardware.  Hardware that would deliver science instrument packages to the lunar surface,hereafter referred to as landers, would include such things as penetrators and hard orsoft landers.  The Government is also interested in other innovative existing hardwaresolutions extensible to the placement of science instrument packages on the lunarsurface.The short development schedule and limited budget preclude extensive lander or technologydevelopment.  Hence, NASA mission planners must focus on mature, functioning hardware,including flight spares from other missions, engineering units of existing flighthardware, or high TRL hardware that can easily be flight qualified, built to print, orthat require limited additional development.  Please see the document (NPR 7120.8 App J -TRL Definitions.pdf) accompanying this RFI on FedBizOpps for definitions of hardware andtechnology readiness levels.The ILN represents a series of US and International Partner provided surface packages(sensing nodes), which act as common science nodes in a lunar geophysical network thatwill address Agency science goals. The NASA SMD expects that each node in ILN willprovide a minimum core suite of two instruments and will include a lander to deliverthese nodes to the lunar surface.  Additional measurements and/or instruments may beaccommodated provided adequate mass, power and budget margins exist.  The missionaddressed by this RFI encompasses two landers (i.e., anchor nodes).  These first twonodes of the ILN will likely be placed at high lunar latitudes.The landers are expected to be small.  For planning and RFI purposes, the followingrepresent approximate anticipated payload/instrument accommodation considerations andconstraints that will be used to assess lander capability and sizing applicability.Mass: 25-50 kgPower: 1 W continuous, 2 W peakG-Load: 40 gData Rate: 100 Mbits per Earth day (transmitted or stored)Note: This RFI ONLY pertains to delivery/lander hardware.  Information on potentialscience instruments is NOT requested.The total life cycle budget for this ILN mission, through phase E, is based on a low costsmall class launch vehicle.  However, the specific launch vehicle for this mission hasnot yet been determined.  Therefore, the precise mass available for landers and payloadsis not yet known, as this will depend on specific launch vehicle capabilities. Tradestudies of payload delivery options are currently underway.The NASA/MSFC has issued this RFI to survey the planetary science community and othercommercial or government interests for existing flight or near flight subsystem and/orcomponent hardware that can support the science objectives of the ILN mission.It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose proprietary information obtained during thisRFI.  To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Actand other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as Proprietary orConfidential will be treated as such.	Personnel from the Applied Physics Laboratory(APL) at Johns Hopkins University may be involved in activities related to this RFI.  AnyAPL personnel given access to information provided to NASA in response to this RFI willbe bound by Non-Disclosure Agreement.This RFI is for information and acquisition planning purposes only and is not to beconstrued as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, norwill the Government pay for information solicited.  This is NOT a request for proposalsor notice of solicitation - no solicitation related to this RFI currently exists.  If asolicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service.Depending on the response, NASA may consider a one-day workshop for responders to presentand discuss their submissions both in an open forum and, potentially, in a confidentialsetting.Requested InformationResponses to this RFI shall be in the form of a PDF document that is emailed tomelinda.e.dodson@nasa.gov.

<DESC>Introduction:   The National Park Service Competitive Sourcing Office, is located in the NPS Headquarters Organization, Office of the Assistant Director, Business Services.   Their primary mission is to manage the National Park Service Competitive Sourcing program and implement OMB Circular A-76, (dated 30 September 2005) and the Office of Management and Budget Circular Number A-76 (Revised May 29, 2003). 
Market research is being conducted as part of the preliminary planning phase (prior to formal public announcement) in accordance with OMB Circular A 76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. The purpose of the market research is to validate the scope and grouping of functions, determine the appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, and confirm whether potential sources are available to satisfy agency requirements allowing standard public-private competition.  Small business sources will be considered in this research.  A contract may or may not result depending on the outcome of the market research and any subsequent public-private competition.  
The purpose of conducting a public-private competition is to determine the most efficient and cost effective method for providing the services required. If conducted, a public-private competition will determine whether the services will be performed under contract from a single source or continue to be provided by a Most Efficient Organization (MEO) of the federal workforce.  The government contemplates the issuance of a solicitation for the service requirements defined below. 
Research Method:   The attached questionnaire has been specifically designed to focus on the scope of requirements of this competition. NAICS codes include, but are not limited to: 323115, 519120, 541990, 712110, and 712120.  Please provide responses by May 9, 2008 via email to JoAnne Grove, Contracting Officer.
Information provided as part of this market research process will be protected.  This information is being collected solely to assist the government in making the determination whether or not to proceed to competition.  Information obtained will not be used later as part of the evaluation process should your firm choose to submit a proposal under any solicitation which may result.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center  Carderock Division (NSWCCD) is conducting a market survey from all potential sources who may be interested in the development and manufacture of electric power generators in the 30 to 1,000 kilowatt (kW) power range for use on Naval Vessels.  The resulting generators will need to be capable of being in production by 2011.  This survey in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies.  This effort has potential for an estimated procurement of 175 generators over ten to twenty years.  The information provided will assist NSWCCD in understanding current generator technologies.  Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  However, respondents must be able to demonstrate that they currently produce electric power generators in the power ranges specified for commercial or other military applications.

<DESC>(1) General Statement of Research Need
 
The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) are interested in demonstrating an off-board sensing reconnaissance role using a lightweight sensor on a small air-launched Unmanned Aerial System (UAS).     This vehicle will be used for low level tactical target finding and tracking during night time operations.     

The UAS is currently configured with a Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) gimbaled sensor payload. To improve sensor performance in extreme low light (new moon, starless) conditions, NRL wishes to investigate a SWIR Illuminator.  

(2) Technical Detail 
a.   To easily integrate onto the UAS, it is desired that the sensor meet the following size, weight and power targets:

•	Size: Complete Illuminator package should not exceed volume of 2.4x2.5x1.3 inches
•	Weight:
•	Power: 
o	Illuminator will receive 20W at 24V – 28V input power

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice (Market Survey) - Computed Radiography System
The Government is interested in obtaining information regarding state-of-the-art, radiographic inspection equipment (Computed Radiography System).  Traditionally, x-ray images have been captured using x-ray film. The film is then processed using developer and fixer chemicals and dried before it can be viewed. This entire process is time consuming, labor intensive, and generates environmental effluents. Computed Radiography (CR) uses an imaging plate, instead of film. The imaging plate contains photosensitive storage phosphors, which retain the latent image. When the imaging plate is scanned with a laser beam in the digitizer, the latent image information is released as visible light. This light is captured and converted into a digital image. The benefits of a CR system over traditional film-based radiography is lower costs over time (one imaging plate can be reused thousands of times and no chemicals to purchase), no environmental concerns, greater archiving capability and image portability (thousands of images can be stored on a single DVD and images can be sent via email in popular image formats), and lower equipment footprint size.
The Government is interested in any vendor that can deliver the Computed Radiography System, and train up to 10 Government personnel in its operation with the following specifications:
1.  The unit must either be a table-top or tower system equipped with a means to erase images on the imaging plates after the latent image is scanned. 
2.  The reader and digitizer shall be able to accept flexible imaging plates directly without the use of a loading cassette. The system must be able to accept imaging plates with a width of 14 inches and a length of 17 inches.
3.  The system must be capable of cycling a minimum of (56) 14 x 17 imaging plates per hour.  
4.  The system shall feature an image reader, system controller/workstation consisting of a CPU with minimum 500GB hard drive, keyboard, mouse, and a minimum sized 19 inch flat panel LCD monitor with a minimum of 3 megapixels resolution and an internal dual format DVD/CD writer where copied data on a DVD/CD may be viewed on other DVD-R/RW drives.  
5.  The digitizer of the CR system must have an attainable laser spot size of 50 microns with a 16 pixel bit depth.  
6. The software of the CR system must provide image file storage on the systems hard drive with the ability to burn and archive to CD and DVD formats. The viewing software must be in a non-proprietary format so that it can export images in .TIFF format. The viewing software must also allow third party viewing of images, without the requirement of having a system workstation or any special, proprietary software. Viewing software and file formats need not be DICONDE compliant but it is preferred. Viewing software shall be lifetime licensed.
7. The controller/workstation shall have image manipulation tools such as gray scale manipulation, contrast manipulation, selective contrast application, and edge enhancement, selective region of interest (ROI) zoom magnification, measurement tools, and image display controls. 
8. The CR system shall be delivered with (20) flexible 14 x 17 imaging plates, each with flexible cassettes. 
9. Training shall be provided on site and shall include system operation and maintenance instruction.

The fronting protection will become the new line of hurricane protection and consist of new pile founded walls and sluice gate structures in front of the existing pumping station and walls that tie-into the adjacent levees.  The current acquisition plan has all or most fronting protection projects being advertised at approximately the same time and all construction activities are scheduled to be completed prior to the 2011 hurricane season.   Each contract, if bid separately, may range between 10-40 million dollars. However, we are currently investigating combining multiple pumping station fronting protection projects into large contracts that could potentially have a contract value range between 100-200 million dollars.   For instance, the four pumping stations along the lakefront in Jefferson Parish, Bonnabel, Suburban, Elmwood and Duncan Pumping Stations fronting protection contracts could be lumped into one large contract.  The responses to this Sources Sought will help determine the appropriate acquisition decisions regarding the type of procurement, size of contracts and the number of contracts to be utilized to obtain construction services for improving Louisianas Hurricane Protection System.    <BR><BR>These projects include performing construction activities in front of operating pumping stations where only a small percentage (if any) of the station can be shut down at anytime.  The construction of a cofferdam will be required to complete certain parts of this project.  Pile founded reinforced concrete T-walls and gate monoliths will be required to be constructed to provide the actual line of protection.  For most sites, the walls will be founded on steel pilings with a steel sheet pile cut-off wall below the base slab.  A representative drawing of a typical fronting protection project is available by email request.  All fronting protection projects will require the placement of rock within the discharge basin in front of the new hurricane protection.  <BR><BR>Access to the jobsite may consist of both land and water access depending on the station in question.  To perform most of the duties associated with these projects (i.e. pile driving, concrete placement, etc.) it  may be necessary to construct a temporary work platform over/within the discharge basin.<BR><BR>Non-Structural features will include the installation of operational sluice gates and motor driven electric actuators.  Controls for these features shall be both local and remote push button controls.  The remote push button controls will be located in the actual pumping station and adjacent safe houses where applicable.  <BR><BR>All interested companies are invited to submit a Capability Statement consisting of appropriate documentation, literature and brochures and should include: 1) Firm name, address, telephone, and fax numbers, 2) Past experience with heavy construction work. 3) Letter from bonding agency indication your performance and payment bond capacity. 4) Indicate whether your interest/capability is in smaller separate contracts, larger combined contracts or both 5) List of existing teaming agreements in place with other businesses. <BR><BR>IMPORTANT:  Responses must be limited to no more than 10 pages.  Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Corps in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Statements that do not meet all requirements or submitted within the allotted time will not be considered.  Electronic submissions will be accepted.  The responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis may be e-mailed to Aline.L.Smith@usace.army.mil or Kelly.M.Gele@usace.army.mil or faxed to 504-862-2892, Attn: Aline Smith.  Responses must be received no later than: 5:00 pm Central Time Zone, Tuesday, May 13, 2008.<BR>

Services will be used at Civil Works and/or Hazardous, Toxic, Radiological Waste (HTRW) sites within the Sacramento District Corps of Engineers boundaries (California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona). <BR><BR>PROJECT TITLE:  SOURCES SOUGHT  Geotechnical and HTRW sites within the Sacramento District boundaries.   The purpose of this synopsis is to conduct market research on the potential for a future acquisition of an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity task order contract for geotechnical and/or HTRW exploration services.   This is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations.  This contract would require exploration services at more complex sites or at sites that require a larger exploration program.  These sites could have multiple exploration activities being performed simultaneously and/or where a large project requires an accelerated schedule.  It is anticipated that the following services will be required:  exploratory drilling of all types for geologic and geotechnical sampling of soil or rock; exploratory trenching with backhoes or track hoes; monitoring well, observation well, relief well, water well or piezometer drilling, installation, development and redevelopment.  Variable exploration depths should be anticipated; 100-200 feet below ground surface (bgs) is typical, depths to 500 feet bgs should be anticipated; depths over 1,000 feet bgs are considered possible but rare.  Services may be required at remote locations.  Work at these larger and more complex sites may require equipment that can perform under unique conditions (i.e., angle drilling) or in such number as to require multiple drill rigs to support a larger drilling effort.  Angle drilling to as much as 45 degrees from vertical should also be anticipated. The contract will require that the work be performed with all necessary equipment and experienced and knowledgeable operators. The company must also maintain a sufficient staff of competent, licensed drillers, skilled at deep drilling in all mentioned media.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS GINNY SLAYTON, 706-787-2019 Vorgomoa.slayton @us.army.mil   A.	General Information.<BR><BR>     The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in countries of Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Cuba announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Sterilization Indicators & Tape.   <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>   The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR><BR>     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Anticipated selection date is October 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for the Sterilization Indicators & Tape product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Sterilization Indicators & Tape product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR><BR>Point of Contact (Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil (706) 787-2094/2019)<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Sterilization Indicators & Tape, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $195,185.40.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional (3 & 4) MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR>     This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no cost samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.  <BR><BR>  The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:     <BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Sterilization Indicators & Tape products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.<BR>a.	At a minimum this includes biological indicators, chemical indicators and indicator tape for a variety of sterilization processes: biological indicators for steam sterilization processes (i.e., flash, vacuum assisted, gravity, gravity displacement), and ethylene oxide (EO)  process; available as  indicator strips, enzyme based early read-out ampoules and self contained vials with a range of response /read-out times(i.e., 1hr, 3hrs, 24hrs, and 48 hrs); chemical indicators for steam processes (i.e., flash, vacuum assisted , gravity, gravity displacement), dry heat process and ethylene oxide process;  available as strips with a range of monitoring parameters; chemical integrator indicators for steam processes(i.e., flash, vacuum assisted, gravity, gravity displacement) and ethylene oxide process; available as indicator strips in a variety of sizes ( 8 1 / 2 x 5/8, 7 1 / 2 x  3 / 8, 2 x 3 / 4, 9 x 3 / 8); indicator tape for steam and ethylene oxide processes;  available in several sizes (1 / 2 x 60yds, 1 x 60yds, 2 x 60yds), with and without tape dispenser; bowie-dick type test pack for sterilizer testing.  <BR>b.	Vendor MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes, indicator types, tape, and test pack listed above.  (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I). <BR>c.	Vendors MUST provide supporting documentation that all Sterilization Indicators & Tape that are manufactured and/or distributed are FDA approved and provide literature to support this requirement with the initial submittal<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for Sterilization Indicators & Tape product line.  Provide the DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor) for distribution of Sterilization Indicators & Tape in the Southeast Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I).  Provide supporting documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. <BR>4.	Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFQ.     Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified. <BR>5.	Vendor MUST have a local vendor representative for the Southeast Region Medical Treatment facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendors MUST provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with initial submittal.  <BR>6.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Sterilization Indicators & Tape products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deem relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.	Vendor MUST provide products that are Latex safe/free.  Vendor MUST provide a complete list indicating their latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc,) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.<BR>8.	Vendor MUST provide manufacturing guideline/instructions for testing, safety, and end-point values for all monitoring indicators.  Provide manufacturing guidelines/instructions with initial submittal.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process <BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request literature and product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the no cost literature and samples to the designated MTFs.  Literature and product samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the literature and samples will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. <BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting using a Likert scale format with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-most acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 15 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.  The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>1.	Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0  <BR>2.  Chemical process indicator will display a visual color change (per manufacture guidelines) when exposed to a sterilization process cycle. (Patient Safety) <BR>a. The chemical process indicator should clearly differentiate between processed and unprocessed products by color change (per manufacture guidelines.)<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by ten (10) trials in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.<BR>c. Before package is sterilized, a chemical process indicator strip is placed on the exterior of the package and placed in a sterilizing process cycle. Evaluator will visually inspect the indicator strip post process cycle for manufacture suggested color change.<BR>3.  Steam Integrator indicator placed in a package for sterilization (according to manufactures instructions) will confirm package sterility with a color change (per manufacture guidelines) to all monitoring areas on the indicator strip. (Patient Safety)<BR>a. Exposure to steam penetration, temperature and time (critical parameters for sterility), the integrator strip color change confirms that sterilization conditions have been met.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by five (5) trials in the non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.<BR>c. Steam Integrator indicators will be placed in package/pouch for processing using a steam process cycle. The evaluator will visually inspect the integrator strip for manufacture suggested color change post steam process cycle. <BR>4.  Designate area on the surface of Indicator Tape for steam displays a specific color change (per manufacture guidelines) when exposed to a steam process cycle. (Patient Safety)<BR>a. If there is no color change to the indicator tape sealing the package for sterilization, the item has not been exposed to a sterilization process.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by five (5) trials in the nonclinical (non-patient care) setting.<BR>c. Indicator tape will be used to seal pre-sterilized packaging and place in a steam process cycle.  Post process cycle, the evaluator will visually inspect the tape for manufacture suggested color change to indicate exposure to a steam sterilization process.<BR>5.  A biological indicator read-out/result of negative growth post a sterilization process indicates sterility has been achieved which allows sterilized package item to be released for use. (Patient Safety)<BR>a. The biological indicator challenge the sterilization process with a known quantity    of microorganisms impregnated in the indicator to be killed demonstrating the effectiveness of the sterilization process by the inability of the organisms to continue growth.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by ten (10) trials in a non-clinical (non- patient care) setting<BR>c. The evaluator will place the biological indicator for steam processes in a package to be sterilized (per the manufacture instructions) and place the package in a steam sterilization process cycle.  Post sterilization cycle the evaluator will incubate the indicator (per manufacture guidelines) and obtain the results from the incubator read-out.    <BR>	<BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold (--at or near 3.0  depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores) as determined by the CPT will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Southeast Region.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Those vendors that fail to respond as required by 5:00PM EST on the 14th calendar day will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFQ.   Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products will be disqualified.      <BR>       Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.    <BR>     The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix. (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 27 MAY 2008 AT 1600 HOURS (4:00 PM EDT)<BR><BR>

The system will include a trailer capable of being towed by a pickup truck or being airlifted; a pneumatic mast capable of providing antenna service to a height of fifty (50) feet in the air; a generator capable of sustaining the system operation, with a fuel tank capacity to maintain operation of the system for at least six (6) hours; battery backup with sufficient capacity to maintain the system operational for thirty (30) minutes in order for the system to be powered down without ruthless loss of power; seven (7) each combiners compatible with the on-hand IntelliRepeaters; all hardware, software and peripheral equipment needed to provide a functional trunked radio system.  The system will operate in the 406-420MHz bandwidth.<BR>The basis for restricting competition is because the infrastructure to be used for this requirement is reclaimed components from the old trunked radio system, which was engineered and maintained by Motorola.

Technical Support for the Advisory Board on Radiation and
Worker Health?s Review of NIOSH Dose Reconstruction Program

Draft Statement of Work dated September, 2007

C.1. Purpose of Contract

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) , National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Office of Compensation Analysis and Support (OCAS) is responsible for conducting individual dose reconstructions on employees of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies, its contractors and subcontractors, and Atomic Weapons Employers (AWEs) under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA). To support NIOSH?s role under EEOICPA, OCAS has retained the services of a contractor to assist in the implementation of a number of major program elements. Under EEOICPA, the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health (Advisory Board), is required to review a reasonable sample of dose reconstructions for scientific validity and quality, assess the methods for dose reconstruction, and review Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) petitions. To support the Advisory Board, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requires the services of a contractor to assist in the implementation of a number of tasks related to independent review of the dose reconstruction process.

C.2. Background and Need

In October 2000, Congress and the President enacted EEOICPA, establishing a federal compensation program for employees of the DOE, its contractors and subcontractors, and Atomic Weapons Employers (AWEs). On July 31, 2001, covered employees with cancer, beryllium disease, or silicosis that may be related to work at nuclear weapons production programs of DOE and its predecessor agencies began applying to the Department of Labor (DOL) under the procedures and requirements of 20 CFR Part 30 for lump sum cash benefits of $150,000 and medical benefits. Also, EEOICPA establishes a SEC consisting of employees with 22 specific cancers who worked at three named DOE facilities or participated in certain nuclear tests and who meet certain other requirements. These employees? cancers are presumed to be radiation related. The EEOICPA permits other groups of employees to petition NIOSH to be added to the SEC.
For most employees with cancer, EEOICPA and the DOL?s regulation require a determination by DOL that the cancer was ?at least as likely as not? related to the occupational radiation dose incurred by the employee at a facility covered by EEOICPA. Criteria and guidelines for making this determination are established by EEOICPA. On May 2, 2002, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published 42 C.F.R. Part 81, Guidelines for Determining the Probability of Causation. This rule will be used to determine the probability that an employee?s cancer was ?at least as likely as not? related to employment at a DOE or AWE facility. To make this determination, DOL will refer cases to NIOSH for an estimation of the radiation dose received by the employee.
EEOICPA also established a federal advisory board, The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health (Advisory Board) which has among its charges the task of reviewing a reasonable sample of the dose reconstructions for scientific validity and quality, assess the methods and procedures for dose reconstruction, review Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) petitions, and advise the Secretary of HHS in these matters.
NIOSH and DOL expect a large number of cancer claims under EEOICPA in the initial five to ten years, many of which will require NIOSH dose estimates. More than 650,000 workers have been employed by DOE and its contractors and subcontractors, not including the employees of the AWEs. To date DOL has forwarded to NIOSH approximately 27,000 claims that require dose reconstructions. While the rate of claims receipt varies, about 200 claims each month are referred to NIOSH by the Department of Labor.
On May 2, 2002, HHS issued 42 C.F.R. Part 82, The Methods for Radiation Dose Reconstruction, that describes the general methods that NIOSH is using to reconstruct occupational radiation doses under EEOICPA (Federal Register Vol. 67 No. 85). These methods are designed to provide fair and efficient processing of a high volume of dose reconstructions. NIOSH will also seek to obtain dosimetry and relevant records and information on a facility or site-wide basis for DOE sites as well as for AWE sites to reduce the volume of records and information that would need to be collected (at greater expense of time and resources) for each individual claim. NIOSH is establishing a Microsoft SQL Server 2000 relational database management system to house these records. The database will include individual claimant data, ?site profile? data and ?worker profile? data.
NIOSH will have a Dose Reconstruction contractor to provide technical support for dose estimation, dose reconstruction and evaluation of SEC petitions submitted in accordance with EEOICPA . The awarded contract will be available on the NIOSH OCAS web site (www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas) prior to the issuance of the formal Request for Proposals for this procurement.
HHS requires technical consultative support for the Advisory Board to conduct the review of the dose reconstruction process. The purpose of this procurement is to continue the services of a contractor to assist the Advisory Board in the review of the NIOSH OCAS dose reconstruction program.

C.3. Contract Tasks

The Contractor shall provide project staff to direct and manage project activities, document work performed by Contractor personnel, prepare reports documenting progress and problems and interface with the Advisory Board.
The Contractor shall document all of the individual steps for each task order performed so that any aspect of a technical review can be evaluated at any point during the course of
performance. The Contractor shall maintain a filing system of all material relevant to each technical review undertaken. The filing system shall be cross-referenced in a manner that allows all material to be easily accessed.
At the conclusion of a contract task, the Contractor may be required to duplicate all records pertaining to the task order not already held by NIOSH.
As an independent organization performing work on behalf of the Government, the Contractor shall provide the support services required to conduct task orders that may include, but not be limited to, the activities listed below.

A. Individual dose reconstruction reviews
B. NIOSH OCAS ?Site Profile? and ?Procedures? Review
C. Review of SEC Petitions

The work associated with each of the Government?s anticipated requirements are set forth in general terms as specified below.

A. Individual dose reconstructions review
The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the reconstruction of dose provides a reasonable estimate of the dose (as needed to adjudicate the claim). The contractor shall evaluate and recommend whether or not the assumptions (individual case assumptions and assumptions applicable to multiple cases) made for dose reconstruction are appropriate and defensible for purposes of this program. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the data from DOE or other sources is of sufficient quality necessary to obtain a reasonable estimate of dose. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the dose reconstruction was performed fairly using NIOSH guidelines and in a manner consistent with other cases.
The contractor shall review all relevant dose reconstruction methodologies and/or procedures employed by NIOSH / NIOSH contractors in conducting individual dose reconstructions and SEC petitions. The contractor shall evaluate whether methodologies and procedures are consistent with requirements under 42 CFR 82 and whether there are sufficient procedures to achieve consistent application of the requirements in 42 CFR 82.
The contractor shall conduct one of three different levels of review on the selected cases: 1) Basic Review, 2) Advanced Review, or 3) Blind Review. The method of review will be determined by the Advisory Board. The number of individual dose reconstruction reviews is estimated to be approximately 62 in the first year. It is expected that there will be approximately 30 Basic Review cases, 30 Advanced Review cases and 2 Blind Review cases. The next four years will also involve a review of approximately 62 cases per year. The breakdown of cases will be the same as described for the first year. The Advisory Board shall determine the cases to be reviewed and the level of review. These
percentages are subject to change by the Advisory Board based on experience with the review process.
The elements of each type of review are detailed below:

1. Basic Review

A. Review Data Collection
Evaluate whether NIOSH received all requested data for the DOE or AWE site from any relevant data source or repository
Evaluate whether the data used by NIOSH for the case was adequate to make a determination with regard to probability of causation.

B. Review Interview and Documentation provided by claimant
Evaluate whether NIOSH appropriately addressed all of the reported work history and events represented by the claimant including but not limited to a) incidents or occurrences, b) actual monitoring practices, c) personal protection practices, and d) work practices
Assure that interview information is consistent with data used for the dose estimate, and if not, evaluate whether reasonable justification is provided.
Review Internal and External Dose Estimates
Evaluate whether all assumptions used in the dose determination are appropriate for a remedial compensation program and whether the benefit of the doubt was resolved in favor of the claimant
Verify dose calculations are appropriate for purposes of determination of Probability of Causation (POC)
Evaluate whether the data were consistent with site radiological monitoring protocols of the time period.
Evaluate the treatment of ?missed dose? and/or ?unmonitored dose? if relevant to the case.
The review of each dose reconstruction shall include an evaluation of all relevant portions of the methods and/or procedures used by NIOSH. This includes, but is not limited to:
Review the internal and external radiation dose reconstruction technical basis documents,
Review of methods for estimating ?missed dose? and ?un-monitored dose? (for cases related to monitoring technology and for cases where monitoring was not performed, monitoring data is not available or incomplete or otherwise inadequate),
Review of the statistical approaches developed for multiple dose reconstructions,
Review procedures used for determining whether data are sufficient to make a reasonable dose estimate,
Review methods or procedures used for substituting exposure information for unavailable or incomplete information,
Review methods for estimating uncertainty in dose and uncertainty distributions surrounding internal and external dose reconstructions on a facility and time specific basis and evaluate whether the benefit of the doubt was resolved in favor of the claimant where there were uncertainties,
Review procedures and questionnaire used for work history phone interview, and
Review the NIOSH methods, procedures and performance in evaluating, analyzing and validating all contractor work products.

2. Advanced Review
The Advanced Review will include all task items in the Basic Review along with the additional tasks listed below:
Review Data Gathering
Review the entire administrative record to evaluate if relevant information exists which was not considered by NIOSH.
Review the relevant aspects of the Site Profile as they apply to the individual case and evaluate the adequacy and completeness of the site profile and evaluate whether the information from the site profile is consistent with the information used for the individual dose estimate.
Evaluate whether, to the extent practicable, all relevant sources of data (e.g., DOE, AWE, CDC, Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML), Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC) , Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), External Health and Safety Regulators, Government Accounting Office (GAO) , Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB), Congressional Hearing Records, other research programs, research publications, publications regarding the history of the DOE complex, or administrative/court records) were identified, evaluated and where appropriate, included within the Site Profile database and where appropriate were used in the assessment of the individual dose reconstruction case.
Review Work History Interview and Documentation provided by claimant
Evaluate the effectiveness of the phone interview in ascertaining relevant work history information.
Evaluate whether, for the cases involving survivors, there has been an adequate effort to research co-located workers and other historical records to characterize the individual?s work history.
Review Internal and External Dose Estimates
Evaluate whether the dose estimate is consistent with relevant radiological information within the NIOSH site profile (e.g. air monitoring, wipe data are consistent with bioassay results)
Compare case information and assumptions with relevant co-worker case information and assumptions for consistency

3. Blind Dose Reconstruction
Using all raw data available to NIOSH, the independent expert will develop an Interactive RadioEpidemiological Program ( IREP) dose input file that they feel is sufficient to make a determination with regard to POC.

B. NIOSH OCAS ?Site Profile? and ?Worker Profile? Review

As part of NIOSH?s effort in completing individual dose reconstructions, NIOSH is establishing a ?Site Profile? database for all covered sites. This database includes records relevant to dose reconstruction other than the personnel dosimetry records (e.g. ? process information, characterization information, incident or occurrence reports, summary dosimetric information, etc.). The contractor shall review selected site profiles established by NIOSH to evaluate the quality and completeness of the profiles and the adequacy of the data for purposes of individual dose reconstructions.
The contractor shall review the conditions, processes, practices and incidents at selected DOE and AWE facilities covered under EEOICPA to evaluate the adequacy of the information available in the NIOSH Site Profile. The review should focus on whether the approach used by NIOSH assured completeness of data necessary for purposes of determining individual eligibility for compensation. The review should include a evaluation of whether NIOSH identified, evaluated and where appropriate incorporated all relevant data sources (e.g., DOE, AWE, CDC, EML, NRC, EPA, External Health and Safety Regulators, GAO, DNFSB, Congressional Hearing Records, other research programs, research publications, publications regarding the history of the DOE complex, or administrative/court records) within the site profile. One task in evaluating that the data identification and collection process were adequate may require the contractor to conduct interviews (one-on-one or group) with, employees, employee representatives, advocacy organizations, health and academic researchers and site ?experts? (those with long standing knowledge of processes, materials, events, and exposures). The contractor may be required to conduct meetings with these individuals or groups at locations near the facilities of interest.
As part of NIOSH?s effort in completing individual dose reconstructions and SEC Petition evaluations, NIOSH is establishing a ?Procedures? database to assist in the performance of such efforts. The contractor shall review selected ?Procedures?
established by NIOSH to evaluate the quality and completeness of the ?Procedures? and the adequacy of the ?Procedures? for purposes of individual dose reconstructions and SEC Petition evaluations.
It is expected that there will be 30 ?Procedures? Reviews and 6 Site Profile Reviews in the first year and in each subsequent year of the contract

C. Review of SEC Petitions

42 CFR Part 83, Procedures for Designating Classes of Employees as Members of the Special Exposure Cohort under EEOICPA of 2000, describes the general procedures to be followed in the review of SEC Petitions. Section 83.15 describes how the Board will consider and advise the Secretary of HHS on a petition.
The contractor shall evaluate Special Exposure Cohort petitions as requested consistent with the provisions of 83.14 and 83.15. Such reviews may focus on the availability and reliability of documents and monitoring data as well as an analysis of the methods proposed by NIOSH to accomplish individual dose reconstructions for members of a considered class. In cases where a site profile is available for a site in question the contractor will make use of such a document. In cases where no site profile is available the contractor will need to develop the basic information needed to evaluate the SEC Petition.
In some cases it may be necessary for the contractor to interview workers and/or site experts to accomplish this task.
At the recommendation of the Board, the contractor may be asked to review either the complete SEC Petition or just an aspect of the petition as designated by the Board.
In a given year of contract performance, it is anticipated that the contractor will review three complete SEC Petitions and an aspect or aspects of three other petitions.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The vision of a digital system that makes information readily
available to an individual has evolved from Vannevar Bush&rsquo;s Memex concept to
the revolutionary realities of the World Wide Web and millions of smaller
digital collections. <span>&nbsp;</span>Today, search
engines can recall thousands of potentially relevant documents in milliseconds
from digital storehouses that swell by petabytes each year. <span>&nbsp;</span>Preserving, securing, analyzing, and accessing
the contents of this digital ocean is essential to national security, commerce,
and daily life. <span>&nbsp;</span>Current systems are
divided into those that provide a query or aggregation layer on top of variably
restricted and implemented systems, and those that serve the specialized needs
of an enterprise, group, or individual. <span>&nbsp;</span>Major
challenges still exist in creating systems that can secure, organize,
characterize, search, and distribute digital information, in its many
encapsulations, across a unified framework. <span>&nbsp;</span>In many ways, the management of digital
information is still where computer systems were before the invention of
internetworking.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For military organizations, secure access to resilient,
reliable information is absolutely essential as it can be, literally, a matter
of life and death. <span>&nbsp;</span>Military operations
involve a multitude of networks and systems operating under various degrees of
duress, with a wide variety of information needs, objectives, and constraints.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In order to further explore these areas, the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency&rsquo;s (DARPA) Information Processing Techniques
Office (IPTO) invites submission of whitepapers from all those engaged in
related research activities. <span>&nbsp;</span>In
addition, a DARPA-sponsored workshop has been planned for 15-16 July 2008 in Northern Virginia, for the purpose of reviewing on-going
research in the implementation of distributed, resilient, and secure, digital
object storage and retrieval (including analysis, query, and dissemination).<span>&nbsp; </span>Information presented at the DOSR workshop
will contribute to the formulation of future areas of DARPA research, such as
creating a prototype system capable of experimental deployment in an
incompletely trusted network.</p>

<DESC>The United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Central Regional Resources Office manages facilities and is responsible for the Bureau's overall environmental compliance.  USGS is required to remove a scientific feature, a set of well logging calibration silos, from the Denver Federal Center property to allow for the transfer of title of such property as necessary for the Denver Regional Transportation District to complete its West Corridor Light Rail System.  Specially configured rock within the silos with a known geophysical response can be removed and relocated in new calibration units.  USGS is proposing to use the Technology Transfer Authority 15 USC 3710 a as amended, to relocate this capability to a new institutional home with the ability to construct or integrate this capability into a silo system that can utilize the granite formations contained in the current silos.  A draft Statement of Work outlining the major steps necessary to accomplish the collaborative effort has been prepared and is attached to this notice.  USGS estimates that a partner or partners will need to provide funds and or services with an estimated value of $250,000 to $300,000.
This is not a procurement; the partner in a Technology Transfer effort contributes funds, equipment and /or in-kind services to the research effort. For more information on the science effort contact Marshall Fischer, 303-236-9338; email mpfischer@usgs.gov. For information on Technology Transfer mechanisms contact Julia M. Giller, Technology Transfer Office, (352) 399-2133 or jgiller@usgs.gov. 
Contracting Office Address: U S GEOLOGICAL SURVEY, MANAGEMENT SERVICES BRANCH, P.O. BOX 25046, MS 205, DENVER, CO 80225  Appendix A \
Illustrative Statement of Work
1.	Plan, design and construct a geophysical tool calibration facility which incorporates the granite material provided by USGS as part of its design and operation at a location identified and under the management control of the Collaborator.
2.	Transport granite material from the Denver Federal Center to Collaborator's designated calibration site for installation. The parties recognize that it may be necessary to utilize construction staging areas for interim periods between phased construction of the calibration facilities.
3.	Provide a project schedule for identifying benchmarks or milestones related to the completion of the reestablished calibration facility and commencement of its operations as a scientific venture.
4.	Provide a calibration facility operations plan which articulates relevant operations information about the facility including, but not limited to:a.	Illustrative examples of the anticipated users of the facility as well as illustrative examples of the types of organizations expected to access this resource,
b.	Anticipated conditions, requirements, restrictions, etc. deemed necessary to safeguard the facility's integrity as a scientific unit and protect the operational environment, and
c.	Policy and procedure to ensure reasonable and generally open access to qualified users of the calibration facilities.  USGS recognizes that facility user fees may be necessary to provide for the sustained operations of the facility.  However, the Bureau anticipates that fee decisions will fully consider the opportunity to maximize the scientific benefits of this facility and consequently provide, as might be necessary, reduced fees for small businesses, government entities, and non profit organizations.  As indicated in the text of the Agreement, for two years following the date of execution of this Agreement, no fees will be assessed for US Government Agencies or Departments to access the reestablished calibration facility.

INTRODUCTION.<br />1.1. The mission of the Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA) South is to support Department of Defense (DoD) health professionals in optimizing the health and wellness of their populations through appropriate, effective and efficient healthcare practices and service delivery. The United States Air Force (USAF) is committed to taking care of its own. Our Air Force (AF) members and their families deserve the best support possible. AF readiness targets combat stress reactions, deployment environment and deployment-related stressors. Tailored support of the base helping agencies targets deployment challenges and engages the services of base helping agencies. The AF community is represented by several agencies, one of which is the Office of the Surgeon General (SG), Community Behavioral Health Division (CBHD).<br />1.2. The USAF SG CBHD provides military readiness support through management of various programs engaged in individual, family and community health initiatives. These programs include Family Advocacy; Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment/Demand Reduction; Education and Development Intervention Services/ Special Needs; and Suicide Prevention. Their objective is to address intervention and prevention strategies for common modifiable behavioral risk factors.<br />1.3. The challenge is recognizing the stressful situations of military members, specifically behaviors and concerns related to deployment stress. Congress has provided funding through the Department of Defense to the USAF to make available tailored support for pre-deployment, deployment, post-deployment, integration and combat stress reactions. There is an ongoing and urgent need to provide early psychological intervention as part of the first response to the traumatic events of pre- and post- deployment.<br />2.0. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES.<br />2.1. Summary of Services Required. This contract will involve the implementation of Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) three-day clinical training workshops, Continental United States (CONUS) two-day and three-day entry level clinical training workshops and four-day master clinician training workshops for military mental health provider (MHP), which include psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, mental health nurses, and mental health technicians. The goal of these workshops is to train military MHP to provide prolonged exposure therapy (PET) and Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) in both deployed locations and in garrison for active duty military members with combat-related anxiety stress disorder (ASD) and PTSD. In addition, the programs will be evaluated to monitor training effectiveness (e.g., pre/post testing for knowledge), use of PE/CPT by clinicians (survey active duty clinicians who have been trained), and other outcome measures (e.g., providing consultation on use of the PCL-M). Authorization for delivering continuing education (CE) credits should be gained by the contractor and CE offered to all eligible workshop participants. The contractors will provide their own equipment for the presentations, including a laptop and projector for running slides, as well as audio support, wires and cables as needed to put on a workshop as described above. The contractors chosen for the delivery of these services will have had deployment training and experience in treating active duty service members returning from OIF/OEF. Contractors with experience treating exclusively retirees or those discharged from the military will not meet the requirements of this contract.<br />2.2. Workshop Materials will be updated and specifically tailored for the PET/CPT treatment of combat-related ASD and PTSD in United States (U. S.) military personnel in both deployed and garrison settings. This will include the creation and updates of workshop handouts, reprints of scientific publications, clinical assessment materials, psychological measures and a provider's treatment manual. The contractor will provide clinical training workshop and consultation materials during training to each attendee in hard copy and/or electronic media form.<br />2.3. CONUS PET/CPT Clinical Training Workshops: The contractor will conduct 8 PET three-day CONUS clinical training workshops and 1 PET four-day CONUS master clinical development workshop at the following locations and dates. The contractor will also conduct 3 CPT two-day CONUS clinical training workshops and 1CPT four-day CONUS master clinician development workshop. All costs associated with travel, food, lodging, creating and transporting the manual or handouts, and miscellaneous expenditures are to be borne by the contractor and are assumed to be covered in the agreed upon cost per workshop. The workshops will include a review of evidence-based interventions for ASD and PTSD with a specific emphasis on PET. Approximately twenty-five to fifty military providers will attend each workshop and attendees will receive workshop type training in the assessment and PET treatment of ASD and PTSD in CONUS and deployed locations. Clinical case examples, including audiotapes and video of treatment sessions of active-duty military patients with ASD and PTSD who were treated in Iraq, will be reviewed. Portions of the training will also target non-provider positions such as mental health technicians in order to give them some idea about what their role might be in the delivery of care in a deployed setting. Attendees will be provided copies of assessment tools and a treatment manual for PET treatment of combat-related ASD and PTSD. The Government reserves the right to readjust the workshop dates in accordance with military and ops tempo demands</p>

The medical facilities of the military services and the DOD health plans are specifically listed as covered by HIPAA. Currently, HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, are in effect for all MTFs. The specific implementation of HIPAA Privacy for DOD medical facilities is set forth in DOD 6025.18-R, and for HIPAA Security, the requirements for AF MTFs are contained in DOD 8580.02-R and AFI 41-217, which also contains additional Information Assurance requirements for all AF MTFs. DOD 6025.18-R, DOD 8580.02-R and AFI 41-217 are incorporated herein by reference. MTFs are responsible to insure overall compliance with HIPAA requirements, which includes incorporation of certain requirements in contracts entered or amended after the respective implementation dates.<br /><br />IAW these regulations, the Contractor and its employees meet the definition of Business Associates. Therefore, a Business Associate Agreement is required by law to comply with both the HIPAA Privacy and Security regulations. This clause serves as that agreement for each MTF, whereby the Contractor and its employees agree to abide by all HIPAA Privacy and Security requirements regarding health information as defined in this clause, DoD 6025-18-R, DOD 8520.02-R and AFI 41-217. Additional HIPAA requirements will be addressed when implemented.</p>

<p>APPENDIX C. HQ USAF/SGR ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST</p>
<p>ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST<br />Revised: 30 Aug 2007</p>
<p>The purpose of this clause is to accomplish the following three objectives: (1) to inform prospective Offerors that AF/SGR presumes that award of this contract or task order may give rise to real or apparent OCIs with respect to other requirements or contracts within AF/SGR or the AFMS; (2) to assist current contractors and prospective Offerors in developing their own business strategies regarding participation in AF/SGR or AFMS requirements and in identifying and, where possible, avoiding or mitigating against OCIs; and (3) to ensure that all current contractors and prospective Offerors are afforded the maximum practicable opportunity to compete for all AF/SGR and AFMS requirements consistent with the restrictions required under FAR Subpart 9.5, Government Accountability Office (GAO) or Court of Federal Claims (COFC) decisions, and sound business practices.</p>
<p>The Contractor and all of its agents (including officers, managers, employees, consultants, and subcontractors) will fully comply with the Special Terms and Conditions Organizational Conflict of interest (OCI) required for efforts in support of AF/SGR activities. Contractor will ensure that all confidential and sensitive information will be fully protected. Such information will include, but not be limited to, all source selection sensitive information, government plans or strategies, and all proprietary information of other companies during contract performance. The disclosure of information shall not constitute a grant of any species of right, title, interest, or property in or to said information.</p>
<p>The Contractor understands and appreciates the absolute need to prevent conflicting roles that could or may bias its support to the AF/SGR office and its AF-wide responsibilities. To ensure that any support provided by the Contractor, its personnel, or its agents, is free of any bias in judgment or objectivity and to preclude the Contractor, its personnel, or its agents, from any unfair competitive advantage in current or future acquisitions, the Contractor will implement the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Organizational Isolation<br />&bull; Company Wide Policy Implementation<br />&bull; Non-Disclosure Agreements</p>
<p>Contractor participation in a requirement or contract with AF/SGR programs may give rise to an unfair competitive advantage in other AF/SGR procurement actions because of access to advance acquisition planning, source selection sensitive or proprietary information. Furthermore, contractor participation in one area may give rise to a real or apparent loss of contractor impartiality and objectivity where its advisory or planning assistance in one area potentially affects its present or future participation in another area.</p>
<p>For purposes of identifying, avoiding and/or mitigating against OCIs, AF/SGR will examine all its requirements and acquisitions for potential OCI or ethical problems, regardless of the cognizant contracting activity (e.g., AFDW, VA, GSA, other agency Multiple Award Schedules, etc.) or the type of contract vehicle used (e.g., FSS order, Multiple Award ID/IQ Contracts, BPAs, FAR Part 15 competitively awards, etc.).<br />An Offeror/Contractor wishing to submit an offer for this procurement, or any Offeror/Contractor which provides or previously has provided support to AF/SGR, must include the following as pan of its offer:</p>
<p>&bull; Perform a comparative analysis of the potential new work against all current and previous work performed in support of AF/SGR. The comparative analysis must be included in the proposal for the new work, and must include a statement certifying whether the contractor believes that its performance of the proposed new work would create a real or apparent OCI. If the contractor believes that no real or perceived OCI will result from an award of the proposed work, no additional action by the contractor is required.</p>
<p>&bull; If the Offeror/Contractor believes that a real or apparent OCI may exist as a result of an award, the contractor shall also submit an OCI Avoidance or Mitigation Plan with its proposal.</p>
<p>Inclusion of the comparative analysis and OCI Avoidance or Mitigation Plan will not be counted against any offer page limitations otherwise stated in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer (and when applicable the appropriate program office, acquisition manager, and legal counsel) will review the comparative analysis and, if provided, the Avoidance or Mitigation Plan, in accordance with the requirements of FAR Subpart 9.5 (Organizational Conflict of Interest) to make an independent determination of whether award to that Offeror would be consistent with those requirements. If it is unilaterally determined by the Contracting Officer that no OCI would arise or that the OCI Avoidance or Mitigation Plan adequately protects the interests of the government in the event of award to that Offeror, the Offeror will be determined, for purposes of this clause, to be eligible for award.</p>
<p>If the Offeror/Contractor knows of no OCI in accepting work under this contract, it shall certify its OCI status and submit the certification at the end of this clause with its proposal and any later award, if awarded the contract. The Contractor shall also obtain a similar certification of OCI status from all subcontractors, teaming partners or consultants prior to tasking any such party under this contract. The Contractor shall appropriately modify and include this clause, including this paragraph, in all consulting agreements and subcontracts of any tier to preserve the rights of the Government.</p>
<p>For breach of any of the above restrictions or for nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant facts required to be disclosed concerning this contract, the Government may terminate this contract, disqualify the Contractor from subsequent related contractual efforts, and pursue any remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>Prior to a contract modification involving a change to the Performance Work Statement, or an increase in the level of effort or extension of the term of the contract, the Contractor shall submit any applicable organizational conflict of interest disclosure or an update of the previously submitted disclosure or representation.</p>
<p>The Offeror/Contractor should review the considerations below in determining whether or not a conflict of interest exists.</p>
<p>&bull; Does the Offeror or any intended subcontractors, teaming partners, proposed employees, or affiliates have Unequal Access to Information? Would award to the Offeror result in the Offeror having the opportunity to access nonpublic information that may give the Offeror a competitive advantage in a later competition for a government contract? Specifically, will the Offeror/Contractor have access to any of the following information:<br />o Budget(s), or Budget Information?<br />o Acquisition Sensitive Information related to the procurement process to include, but not limited to Acquisition Plans, Requirements, Statements of Work, or Evaluation Criteria?<br />&bull; Does the Offeror or any intended subcontractors, teaming partners, proposed employees, or affiliates have "impaired objectivity" because the Offeror's ability to render impartial judgments may be compromised because of its conflicting role(s) on this effort and other government contracts?<br />&bull; Do "biased ground rules" exist? Most commonly, this would include a situation where the Offeror has, as a government contractor, written specifications or a statement of work for this effort, which could skew competition in favor of itself?<br />&bull; Is the Offeror aware of any other information relating to this proposed contract/order, which could reasonably be construed as creating an OCI?</p>
<p>The Offeror/Contractor hereby certifies to the best of its knowledge its OCI status below:</p>
<p>(Offeror: Choose one of the following two statements. Delete the statement that does not apply.)</p>
<p>No real or perceived OCI, as defined in FAR 2.1 and discussed in FAR 9.5, will result from an award of the proposed work (there are no &lsquo;Yes' responses to the questions above).</p>
<p>A real or apparent OCI may exist as a result of an award and therefore an appropriate OCI Avoidance or Mitigation Plan is attached (Offeror shall include an appropriate OCI Avoidance or Mitigation Plan, as required by this clause, with its proposal to the Contracting Officer. [NOTE: Either delete statement #2, or delete the last phrase allowing them to submit it, or include following statement re Mitigation Plan f related to the AFDW BAA: Mitigation Plans are not permitted in order to resolve OCI issues involving contracts awarded under the AFDW A&amp;AS contract and the AFDW BAA.).</p>

<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) <br />Marine Corps Forces Central Command (MARCENT) currently has 4 Riverbed Steelhead 3020 systems connected to the MARCENT network. These systems were purchased to optimize traffic flow throughout the MARCENT data network. The current warranty will lapse on May 16, 2008. A substantial monetary investment was made to acquire an optimization system. Riverbed was the hardware which was purchased for MARCENT. Since the systems have been placed into production, it has been fully integrated into our network and every Marine and civilian employee has been trained on the system. This familiarization constitutes over 200 man-hours of training for the MARCENT G-6 staff. Given that the system is only a year old and still in prime working order, it is more cost effective for MARCENT to continue the current warranty. By continuing with the current Riverbed system, the only cost associated with the purchase would be the extended warranty itself. Purchasing a new system would require the initial cost of the system which would be in excess of $100,000.00 and the additional cost of training and installation. Furthermore, an extended warranty would still be required. By staying with Riverbed and just purchasing the extended warranty, there is no additional cost and there would be no impact to the network.</p>

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)

I. Background
The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) is an independent regulatory agency responsible for the regulation of ocean borne transportation in the foreign commerce of the United States.  The FMC administers the Shipping Act of 1984, as amended by Public Law 105-258 (The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998), Section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988 and Public Law No. 89-777.  All of these statutes were amended and modified by the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which took effect on May 1, 1999.  To achieve its statutory mandates, the FMC relies on technology to support its mission.

II.  Objectives and Scope
The objective is to obtain a COOP site to host hot back-ups of all FMC databases and to manage the FMC offsite backup tape storage.  
  
III.  Deliverables
COOP Site
The FMC needs a secure site with no public access.  The site must also be independently certified in writing by a licensed Professional Engineer (“PE”) who is also a qualified Blast Engineer/Consultant as having been designed to meet the Level C or higher design criteria for physical security protection for leased spaces in new federal office buildings and major modernization projects, as published by the Interagency Security Committee of the General Services Administration, edition 2003 or later.  A qualified Blast Engineer/Consultant is (i) a licensed PE with a minimum of 10 years of demonstrated experience in the design and assessment of similar facilities subjected to blast loads, such as Federal Courthouse and US Embassies, (ii) included in the BMAG list of blast consulting firms (https://bmag.usace.army.mil) and (iii) in possession of and has been approved to retain the full version of the ISC blast criteria. 

The COOP site must be located at least 25 miles, but no more than 50 miles, from the FMC headquarters in Washington, DC.

The COOP site must also provide the ability to allow select FMC personnel access to the equipment seven days a week, Monday through Sunday, from 7:00am to 6:00pm.  The  access will be coordinated with the facility prior to the visit.

Due to the sensitivity of the data within the databases, the FMC requires a secure environment in which only FMC personnel will maintain the systems.  

The FMC requires the following:
	One Half (1/2) rack of 24 “U”s
	10/100 Internet Connection
	10/100 Management Ethernet Connection
	Basic Monitoring
	Remote Power Control at the Plug Level
	Power allocations via redundant feeds
	IP Addressing
	Dual isolated power feeds to the rack level

The FMC will provide and install the servers, switch, and firewall.  FMC personnel are solely responsible for the installation and the maintenance of the FMC owned equipment.

Off-site Back-up Tape Storage
Off-site data storage in tape storage facilities certified to GSA standards (AA-V-2737) of up to 300 cartridges.  
Includes one weekly round trip pickup and delivery approximately 7 LTO tapes in contractor owned vehicles by drivers with a minimum security clearance level of secret.

The FMC anticipates that it will require 4 emergency pickups per year.

IV. Period of Performance
June 15, 2008 through June 14, 2009

V. Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)
The Government will periodically evaluate the Contractor’s performance in accordance with the QASP. The purpose of the QASP is to ensure reliable, uninterrupted services are provided in accordance with the PWS.  The plan ensures unnecessary complaints and acceptable performance.

The Government’s QASP includes the following elements:
§ Periodic inspection of the Contractor’s work
§ Progress meetings with the Contractor

Methods of Surveillance:
Random Evaluation: This method employs a “spot check” style of evaluation and may be adjusted, based on quality and/or productivity trends.  The Government retains the right to inspect all requirements of the contract. Unacceptable performance will be recorded and the Contractor shall be required to correct the unacceptable condition within a 24-hour time period.  If the Contractor does not correct the unacceptable condition within 24-hours, the COTR will notify the Contracting Officer who will take appropriate administrative action for unacceptable performance.


PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY (PRS)

A PRS table will be added to the award for each task listed in the PWS.  
		Acceptable Quality Level – 100%
		Evaluation Method – Random Sampling. See QASP
		Incentive/Disincentive – Performance Rating

The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that “equal” products must meet are specified in the solicitation.
(b) To be considered for award, offers of “equal” products, including “equal” products of the brand name manufacturer, must—
Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation;
Clearly identify the item by—
(i) Brand name, if any; and
(ii) Make or model number;

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an “Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979.”  (Note:  DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer’s decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer).

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-24.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a High Power Laser System to be used in the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Electron Physics Group at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.

BACKGROUND:
The NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology has the mission of providing measurement methods, standards, and technology to support all phases of nanotechnology development from discovery to production.  As part of this mission, we have programs to carry out research on generation of low emittance, high-brightness ion beams.  To carry out this research, we require a high power laser to pump a tunable, near infrared laser used for ionizing neutral atoms.

The laser system we require must be suitable for use as a pump laser for either a solid state laser such as a Ti:Sapphire ring laser or a dye ring laser.  It must have high output power in order for the laser being pumped to have high output power.  In addition, it must have a narrow linewidth for future applications such as holography, where a long coherence length is required.

All interested Contractor’s shall provide a quote for the following line items(s):

Line Item 0001 – The contractor shall furnish one (1) each Higher Power Laser System.
 
The System shall meet or exceed the following minimum technical specifications:

1.	Must be 100% compatible with operation as a pump laser for an actively stabilized scanning single frequency ring Ti:sapphire laser such as the Coherent model MBR-110 or Spectra-Physics model Matisse.
2.	Must operate with a single longitudinal mode with linewidth at most 5 MHz.  While this is not strictly necessary for pumping a Ti:sapphire laser, it is a requirement for this purchase because the pump laser will also be used in stand-alone applications, such as holography, where long coherence length is required.
3.	Output power at least 18 W.
4.	Output wavelength 532 nm.
5.	Beam diameter 2.2 mm +/- 10%
6.	Pointing stability: no more than 2 urad/deg. C.
7.	Power stability: less than 1% deviations.
8.	Beam quality M2 less that 1.1.
9.	Optical noise less that 0.03% rms measured over 10 Hz to 1 GHz.
10.	Customer replaceable laser diode modules.
11.	Includes water riser and chiller.

Installation and Warranty:

1.  The contractor shall schedule and facilitate installation/set-up.  Installation, at a minimum, shall include uncrating/unpacking of all equipment, set-up and hook-up of the instrument, demonstration that the system is working properly, and removal of trash.  Onsite installation and demonstration shall be done at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, within 30 calendar days of delivery to NIST.

2.  The Contractor shall provide a minimum of a One (1) Year Warranty.  Quotation must include unlimited telephone/e-mail support, during the warranty period, for questions regarding operation.  This warranty must cover non-consumable parts and travel/labor on-site should this become necessary within the warranty period.

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:

1.  Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.
2.  The Contractor shall complete the performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications.  The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready (during installation or soon thereafter), as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor.

Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the contractor’s commercial schedule.

FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001.

EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF QUOTE:  Award shall be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor “Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement,” 2) Past Performance, 3) Past Experience, and 4) Price.  

Technical capability, past performance, and past experience, when combined, shall be more important than price.

Technical Capability:  Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Quotations shall include the make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature, which addresses all specifications & clearly documents that the product offered meets or exceeds the specifications identified herein.

Past Performance:  Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the products and services, provided by the Contractor.  Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/or information from other sources, including NIST.  Offerors shall provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar products have been sold.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum:  the name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer, if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed.

Past Experience:  Past Experience will be evaluated to determine the degree of vendors’ experience in successfully providing comparable systems for the types of applications described herein.  Evaluation of past experience may be based on contacts used for past performance; however, the vendor should provide additional references relating to its past experience information, if necessary.

Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable in accordance with the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

<p>Name Brand Justification for Miros SM-094 Microwave Range Finder</p>
<p>The Miros SM-094 Microwave Range Finders are the standard bridge clearance (air gap) monitoring sensors that support the CO-OPS environmental monitoring stations on the Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and throughout the Pacific. CO-OPS uses these monitoring stations for predicting and measuring water levels and currents, and disseminating this information to maintain safe maritime navigation and waterborne commerce. This information is also used for many practical purposes to include nautical charting, coastal engineering and tsunami and storm surge warnings. The procurement of these Miros microwave range finders is in support of the existing monitoring stations. The electronics, software and mounting of the monitoring stations are all designed to house the Miros SM-094 Microwave Range Finder whose technology is proprietary. Implementing different sensors in place of the current sensor will result in additional cost and resources. Also, there will be resulting delay for testing, training, and purchase of support equipment. <br />Under the current CO-OPS operating system any environmental monitoring sensor or system that has not previously been approved must be subjected to a series of tests to ensure the quality of the data produced by that sensor or system and the durability of that sensor or system for the intended use. These tests usually include bench testing using controlled conditions and physical measurement, controlled environmental testing to check a senor's or system's reliability under different conditions, and long term comparison testing with accepted sensors and systems at multiple real world locations. These tests and the analysis of the resulting data take a large amount of time, money, and resources to conduct.</p>
<p>CO-OPS monitoring stations are designed for optimal performance with the inclusion of this specific Miros sensor. A change of the sensor will result in a need to redesign the existing monitoring stations to accommodate the new or altered sensor.</p>
<p>CO-OPS cannot risk the possibility of new mounting hardware to be developed and purchased to mount a new or altered sensor.</p>
<p>The data collection platforms at the CO-OPS monitoring stations are programmed to collect data from this specific Miros sensor. If a different sensor is implemented additional cost for software development, programming, calibration and testing will be required with no certainty of their successful integration between all the existing sensors and systems. <br /><br />Using another type of sensor will require the purchase of additional equipment so that the field crews can support multiple sensor types in a given region.</p>
<p>CO-OPS also has the ability and equipment to calibrate and repair this Miros sensor. If a different sensor is implemented new calibration and repair equipment for that sensor will need to be developed and purchased. Additional training will also be required for those tasked with calibrating and repairing these Miros sensors.</p>

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

OFDA’s Office of the Director assists the Director and Deputy Director with tracking trends and policy developments in the humanitarian assistance field, recommends strategies for action, and maintains global relationships with OFDA implementing partners and other donors.  
 
INTRODUCTION

Created in 1947 by the United Nations Participation Act, the United States Mission to the United Nations (USUN) assists the President and the Department of State (DOS) in conducting United States (U.S.) policy at the United Nations (UN).  An important function of the USUN is to keep the DOS informed of events at the UN.  USUN officers report on meetings and make recommendations to DOS as to what course of action the U.S. should pursue.  This information is also relayed to overseas American Embassies which have an interest in particular items under UN consideration.  The USUN is also a link between the U.S. Government (USG) and the UN Secretariat.  The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) maintains a liaison at the USUN to represent USAID’s views and interests on humanitarian assistance issues and to report to USAID on the proceedings of UN activities.

OBJECTIVE

To assign a Humanitarian Advisor to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations (USUN) in New York as the senior advisor and USUN authority on humanitarian affairs.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Humanitarian Advisor serves as an authoritative source of information on humanitarian issues and humanitarian policy for USUN Ambassadors and staff.  He/She will help plan USUN strategies and responses to humanitarian crises, actively lobby members of UN delegations on U.S. positions on humanitarian issues, provide effective liaison with the UN Secretariat and the representational offices in New York of UN specialized agencies; negotiate resolutions in the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, and anticipate and prepare documents, briefing memos and statements for USUN Ambassadors for important meetings and events.

The assignment involves providing expert analytical and advisory support for the planning, development and execution of U.S. foreign policy within a broad and complex geographic or functional specialty area.  The work requires applying a rigorous analytical approach to data that is often vague, unsubstantiated or contradicts existing knowledge.

The work is complicated by the need to provide expert advice and guidance that influences the decisions and actions of senior policy officials and the need to quickly, accurately and decisively determine the relevance and significance of information to the policy interests of the USG.  It is further complicated by the need to produce widely disseminated analytical products that represent official assessments of complex issues and keep the policy-making and foreign affairs communities continuously informed of new issues and developments.

Contacts will be with DOS and USAID employees at all levels, both in New York and Washington, as well as personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in UN and other agencies, congressional staff, experts, and representatives of non-governmental organizations.  The role requires significant interaction with foreign delegates, demanding strong diplomatic and communication skills to represent U.S. positions in a complex multilateral setting.  Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings, including open meetings, conferences, and negotiating sessions, where the Humanitarian Advisor may be called upon to explain and defend U.S. positions.  The Humanitarian Advisor post is organizationally located within OFDA’s Office of the Director while physically located at the USUN offices in New York City.

The Humanitarian Advisor's duties and responsibilities will include the following:

• Serve as the authoritative USUN source of all humanitarian policy information for the Permanent Representative, other USUN Ambassadors and USUN staff;
• Serve as an active member of the USUN team and advise the U.S. Permanent Representative and the Representative and Deputy Representative to the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on the initiation, formulation and impact of policy positions and developments;
• Anticipate the needs of the Ambassadors regarding developments in the areas of humanitarian affairs and prepare analyses, briefings, documents and meetings;
• Prepare the Ambassadors to speak on critical subjects before the Security Council, UN General Assembly, ECOSOC and in other UN bodies;
• Analyze and critique UN proposals for the Ambassador and DOS and, as necessary, draft or negotiate alternative proposals;
• Provide leadership for the identification, research, analysis and development of recommendations on all issues and matters relating to humanitarian affairs and anticipate the need for such policy analysis;
• Develop recommendations for U.S. action and positions, including specific proposals to the U.S. Representative and other USG representatives for appropriate U.S. positions in the UN;
• Assist USUN and DOS Officers in the development of appropriate guidance and voting instructions and prepare major policy speeches, briefing/background papers and statements/talking points;
• Represent the U.S. in meetings of the UN General Assembly, ECOSOC and other UN bodies as directed; actively lobby members of other UN delegations and closely liaise with the UN Secretariat to develop consensus for U.S. positions; and negotiate resolutions, statements and agreements on relevant issues and matters under the guidance of the DOS’ Bureau for International Organizations;
• Attend various UN, USUN, UN Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) Donor Support Group (ODSG), Humanitarian Liaison Working Group (HLWG) and other meetings and provide authoritative information and views to formulate policies and coordinate strategies on policy issues;
• Enunciate USUN views and report on decisions taken;
• Initiate and maintain strong working relationships with other diplomatic missions in order to promote consensus for voting, report on positions of other delegations, negotiate positions and coordinate activities;
• Develop and maintain cooperative working relationships with other USUN components and relevant USG offices and serve as an expert point of contact for these groups in the area of humanitarian affairs;
• Answer relevant congressional and public inquiries and speak to various visiting groups through the USUN’s public affairs program; and
• Provide back-up representation for development and post-conflict issues, including transition from relief to development, during the absence of other USUN officers.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
Day-to-day supervision will come from the Deputy Representative to ECOSOC or his/her designee, and from the Humanitarian Coordination Specialist in OFDA’s Office of the Director.  The Humanitarian Advisor will receive general policy guidance from the U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN, the U.S. Representative to ECOSOC, and OFDA’s Deputy Director.  

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Overall assignments are made in terms of broadly defined functions emanating from OFDA.  Specific assignments frequently originate out of the liaison activities of the work and the Humanitarian Advisor will independently negotiate the scope and objective of projects under the general guidance of those listed above subject to general agency policies and operating requirements.  The Humanitarian Advisor will assume responsibility for planning, coordinating and carrying out projects and keeping all relevant stakeholders informed.  

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During site visits (if required), there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During site visits (if required), the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST/TI. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of EMC DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000 B 32-Port Switch. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for the Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IV&V has a need for equipment that will provide a small scale replica of the current Consular Consolidated Database configuration. This need is based on IV&Vs task to test all CA applications and systems prior to deployment. There are tools that this configuration (EMC Symmetrix DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000 B 32-Port Switch) offers that is unique to any other equipment that may be used to support Oracle 10g RAC because it offers the same technology as the DMX4 in production but in a very small and cost effective package. The DMX800 provides the same functionality including command line interface. Deployment strategies for the IV&V environment will therefore mirror the production environment, hence nothing will be missed during IV&V testing. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for the justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The EMS SAN and Brocade switch are required to effectively model the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) for purpose of testing database configuration and associated end-user software applications. This hardware is being evaluated as follow-on replacements for the current testing platform of IBM servers and backup solution. The EMC SAN and Brocade switch will allow timely shifting between database test configurations that other backup solutions cannot provide, through snapshots of the entire CCD Test Region (totaling close to 800 Gigabytes of data). The EMC Symmetrix DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000B 32-Port Switch have undergone test and assessment and will receive final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS WERE POSTED:
I was wondering if you could give a better description of the inner glass door with four operation ports (no outer window/light.

 I am not quite sure what exactly you are looking for, so if you could give clearer description, I would appreciate it.

 The inner glass door in the Espec chamber is provided in lieu of: a window in the door; a light in the chamber; and gloves.  The manufacturer’s information indicates the following: “Allows full-view of the workspace when the outer insulated door is opened. Two glove ports enable you to reach in and manipulate the test samples. The standard window is deleted.”
 
The window, light, and gloves are acceptable alternatives

1) Inner glass door with four operational ports (no outer window/light).

We presume this is requesting two doors - an outer door with no window and not light for the area between the doors,

and an inner door made of glass (or with a glass viewing area) as well two sets (total of four openings) of glove ports,

which only are accessible after opening the outer door.

Is this a correct interpretation ??? 

Does the window need to be made of glass ???

Or can it be made of Plexiglas ???
 
We need either the inner glass door with ports, per the Espec chamber (see http://www.espec.com/na/gallery/image_med/63/platinous), or a viewing window and gloves.

 2) Regards Specification 9. Facilities:  Does it require the humidity supply to be included in the system ???

or quoted as an available option ???

The humidity supply (plumbed or reservoir) needs to be included.
 
3) Regards Specification 12. Window: This seems to contradict the inner glass door requirement.

Please clarify.

 We need either the inner glass door with ports, per the Espec chamber (see http://www.espec.com/na/gallery/image_med/63/platinous), or a viewing window and gloves.

 4) Regards Specification 13. # of Access Ports: When standing in front of the door of the unit and facing the unit, 

should the access port be on the left hand side of the unit ???

or the right hand side ???

 Left side is preferred.

 5) Regards Specification 14. Gloves Port: Spec is asking for one set which would be two (2) holes.   Again, this seems to contradict

the inner glass door with four operation ports.   Please clarify.

 we need either the inner glass door with ports, per the Espec chamber (see http://www.espec.com/na/gallery/image_med/63/platinous), or a viewing window and gloves.

 6) Regards Specification 15. Shelves: does one set mean one (1) shelf ???

If not, how many shelves in a set ???

 One shelf is acceptable.

 Also, are there current units accomplishing these tests ???

Yes.

 and if so, what brand and or manufacturer ???
 
Tenney TH-27C.
 
. Are the test specimens energized during all of the tests?

Yes.

2. What are dimensions of the largest test specimen?

Undefined.  However, historically the largest has been per the specification. 

3. How many test specimens will be tested at any given time?

Up to four small handheld detectors in a subchamber (approximately 7 liters, see STPs) or one of the large specimens. 

4. Are the test specimens composed of primarily aluminum and electronic

   components? 

 Varies, but the largest specimens have been.

5. I need clarification of the four operation ports in the glass door? 

We need either the inner glass door with ports, per the Espec chamber (see http://www.espec.com/na/gallery/image_med/63/platinous), or a viewing window and gloves.
 
6. Are the glove ports to be mounted in the glass door?

We need either the inner glass door with ports, per the Espec chamber (see http://www.espec.com/na/gallery/image_med/63/platinous), or a viewing window and gloves in the outer door.

7. What electrical classifications does the chamber have to meet?

    Interior?

   Exterior?

No hazardous locations approvals required.

<DESC>THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL HSFEHQ-08R-0022 HAS BEEN AMENDED AS FOLLOWS:1.  EXTENDS THE DATE PROPOSALS ARE DUE FROM 1/25/08 TO 1/28/08, 2 PM, EST.
2.  MODIFIES THE RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS FROM ALL QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS OPERATING WITHIN THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA TO ALL QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS OPERATING WITHIN OTTAWA COUNTY.
3.  PROVIDING ANSWERS THAT WERE FURNISHED DURING THE SITE VISIT OF JANUARY 11, 2008 AND QUESTIONS QUERIED BY INTERESTED CONTRACTORS UP TO JANUARY 15, 2008.  THE ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED AS FOLLOWS:

QUESTIONS FROM CONTRACTORS

1.  I would like to use the format/forms that the contract office places on the solicitation so I can send them back electronically.  This one is in an adobe format and it?s protected.  Is there a way you can send it to me in a word or tell me how to unprotect this document?  Indeed the Form 1449 is protected.  Please print it out and sign Block 30b and date Block 30c.  You can then scan and send this to me via email at Linda.S.Jackson1@dhs.gov or via fax at (202) 646-1765.  

2.  You said that the solicitation was limited only to firms residing or doing business within Ottawa County.  Is this correct or will that requirement change?  The rationale for limiting the area is FAR 26.202(a)(2), which states:  The designated area need not include all the counties in the declared disaster/emergency area(s), but cannot go outside it.  Since the disaster declaration was limited to specific counties, the solicitation must also be limited to specific counties.

3.  Preventive monthly, is it done monthly on every unit?  Yes.  It is part of the monthly maintenance.

4.  For the monthly maintenance, what happens if the person is not there?   FEMA?s policy is to do an outside inspection.  Please notify FEMA and DHOPS if the applicant does not respond after the third time visit.  Appropriate action will then be taken at that time.  

5.  If the questions are going to be in writing, are you going to post them in writing as well?   Correct, they will be posted on the 18th.  

6.  Can we have a list of the sign-in sheet?   The contractor attendance sheet is attached.  

7.  When are proposals due?  This requirement has been extended to January 28, 2008.  

8.  The solicitation states it is exclusively for companies residing or operating within the state of Oklahoma (OK).  I represent a SDVOB, non-based company with significant experience with MH/TT maintenance and deactivation and we have identified several OK companies willing to enter a Joint Venture (JV) under 13 CFR 125.15 with us.  My questions are as follows:

a.  Can we enter into a JV pursuant with an OK concern and submit a viable proposal on the solicitation although we, a SDVOB, are not an OK based company?
The answer is yes however the OK company must primarily operate within the County of Ottowa (see explanation # 2).  
b.  Is there a document we have to submit to you as evidence of a JV under 13 CFR 125.15?  Please see FAR 19.1403  Status as a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern is as follows:
(a) Status as a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern is determined in accordance with 13 CFR Parts 125.8 through 125.13; also see 19.307. 
(b) At the time that a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern submits its offer, it must represent to the contracting officer that it is a? 
(1) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern; and 
(2) Small business concern under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to the procurement. 
(c) A joint venture may be considered a service-disabled veteran owned small business concern if? 
(1) At least one member of the joint venture is a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern, and makes the representations in paragraph (b) of this section; 
(2) Each other concern is small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the procurement; 
(3) The joint venture meets the requirements of paragraph 7 of the explanation of Affiliates in 19.101; and 
(4) The joint venture meets the requirements of 13 CFR 125.15(b). 
       (d) Any service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern (nonmanufacturer) must meet the requirements in 19.102(f) to receive a benefit under this program.

9.  Can this solicitation be sole sourced?  This is a competitive total set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses only.  This requirement will not be sole sourced.

Furnishing and placing concrete planks and jersey barriers (to serve as cut-off walls), and furnishing and placing riprap aprons in the stream channel.  Riprap may be gathered along the project road, considerable effort is necessary to gather and sort riprap.  The project road is difficult access for full size vehicles.  Selection of appropriate construction equipment may be limited by the road condition.  Only minimal improvements to the road are allowable to accommodate construction equipment access and subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.  Staging areas for equipment and materials is difficult since the road is located in a steep narrow canyon.  Opportunities to detour traffic are not available.  The project is located on the Fishlake National Forest.  A Forest Visitor/Travel Map may be helpful to determine the proximity of the project from a larger prospective.  A Forest Visitor/Travel Map may be acquired from the Fishlake National Forest.  This Project will be uploaded approximately May 7, 2008, and will be set aside for Total HUBZONE!!!
This project will be estimated between $25,000.00 to $100,000.00.
