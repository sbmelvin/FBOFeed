<DESC>NASA/SSC has a requirement for services to be performed by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality to Review Clean-Up Documentation under a Memorandum of Agreement between NASA and the Mississippi Department of Enviornmental Quality For Consolidation of Remediation Activities at NASA/SSC, dated September 11, 2003 in accordance with the attached Statement of Work: STATEMENT OF WORK FOR THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY TO REVIEW CLEAN UP DOCUMENTATION	    	    (Revised 10/28/03) BACKGROUND: The John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC) has been in operated since mid- 1960. As a part of historical operations various chemicals were utilized and improperly handled, which may have resulted in the release of contaminants into the environment. Therefore, SSC began a site identification and investigation process of clean up areas in 1990, which resulted in 40 potential sites. Of the 40 sites originally identified, 29 were found to be no further action sites (NFA), 8 will require long term clean up activities, 2 will become NFA sites, and one site will be a long-term monitoring site. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) entered into a Domestic Reimbursable Space Act Agreement for the implementation of a consolidated remediation program for the 40 potential locations to ensure compliance with applicable state and federal environmental regulations.  SCOPE OF WORK: The MDEQ shall: 1.	 Perform regulatory review and provide comments on all documents and data provided in a time frame that is agreed on by both parties. 2. Conduct site visits as deemed appropriate to review SSC’s response actions and to ensure consistency with appropriate state requirements and mutually agreed upon site-specific requirements    3.      If deemed necessary, collect and perform analyses at NASA’s request that are deemed appropriate.  4.    Attend public information type forums used to inform those external to SSC steps being taken to remove contaminants from the clean up areas. NASA shall provide: 1.     Submit to MDEQ all documents and data required to meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. 2.  Accommodate MDEQ requests for site visits to conduct inspections, sampling, and/or meetings as deemed necessary. 3.     Provide reimbursement for all MDEQ activities performed in accordance with the Space Act Agreement. DELIVERABLES: The MDEQ shall submit to NASA comments for submitted documents either electronically or hard copy for incorporation into a final document that leads to a NFA notice or clean up remedy.   PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The period of performance of this requirement shall be the date of the order and continue through two (2) years. NASA/SSC intends to purchase the services from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.	 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on February 27, 2004.   Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement to have a on-site Lindgren RF Enclosure disassembled, relocated, and re-assembled from NASA building 4655 to building 4205. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services from ETS-Lindgren on a sole source basis. These services are required to disassemble, relocate, re-assemble and recertify an existing Lindgren R.F.  "screen room". Lindgren R.F. is experienced in the assembly and test verification of this specific hardware. Performance of this assembly and test procedures by another provider would result in increased risk to the government, and the validity of the performance certification would be in question. Development of this enclosure by another source would require an inordinate delay and adversely affect project schedules at MSFC.  The cost of such a development would also more than likely exceed that of this procurement due to the specialized nature of the hardware involved, and the associated "start-up" costs that would be incurred by another manufacturer. The Government intends to acquire a commercial service using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Janet Appleton at janet.appleton@msfc.nasa.gov  no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 2/21/2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

The concession will operate and maintain a passenger ferry service between St. Marys, Georgia and Cumberland Island National Seashore and provide limited refreshments and sundry sales onboard the vessel. Gross revenues over the past three years have averaged approximately $462,000 annually. The term of this contract is expected to be ten years, and will require a minimum franchise fee to be paid to the National Park Service of 10% of gross revenue per year. The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR 51, has determined that this is a qualified contract, within the meaning regarding determination of a preferred offeror, because gross receipts are expected not to be greater than $500,000 in the first year of the contract. Therefore, there is a preferred offeror for this contract and all offers will be evaluated according to the terms set forth in the Prospectus.  Offers must be received by close of business at 4:00 p.m. on April 12, 2004. The Prospectus will explain the business opportunity, the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract, the proposal instructions, and the proposal package (including the selection factors). There will be an administrative charge to recoup printing cost of $30.00 plus a $5.00 mailing fee for each prospectus. Please make checks for $35.00 payable to the National Park Service. Include a physical address (not post office box) and telephone number. A site visit will be scheduled in the near future as an opportunity for interested parties to visit the business and view the existing operation first hand.

All requests for prospectuses should be made in writing to Henry Benedetti, Chief, Commercial Services, National Park Service, AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street, S.W., Atlanta, GA  30303.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION FOR THREE CONTRACTS, AND POTENTIAL AWARD FOR ONE 8A OR HUBZONE ELIGIBLE CONCERN. This procurement will result in the award of up to four separate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity, IDIQ, Design-Build Construction Contracts for general building type projects- new construction and renovation-roofing, demolition, repair of facilities and infrastructure including but not limited to 1-barracks and personnel housing facilities, 2-administrative facilities, 3-warehouses and supply facilities, 4-medical and dental facilities; 5-abatement and handling of hazardous-regulated materials-including but not limited to asbestos, lead paint and PCBs; 6-the civil, sanitary, stormwater, mechanical and electrical systems  This Area Includes But Is Not Limited To: Naval Suppport Activity Mid-South, Millington, TN; Marine Corps Reserve Center, Memphis TN; Large Cavitation Channel, President’s Island, Memphis, TN; Navy Marine Corps Reserve Center-NMCRC, Nashville, TN; NMCRC Bessemer, AL; NMCRC, Huntsville, AL; and NMCRC Little Rock, AR. Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request For Proposal, RFP, source selection procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Each contract will be for one base year with four one-year options.  The total 5 year, base year and 4 option years, estimated cost for all four IDIQ Contracts is NTE $30,000,000.  The anticipated cost for each task order is between $100,000 and $3,000,000.  This range is for information purposes only and may vary.  Proposers will be required to submit a bid bond for the seed project and for each task order. This procurement will include potential award for one 8a or one HubZone eligible contractor. These proposers will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I.  If the 8a or the HubZone proposers are not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the solicitation will be reverted to unrestricted and awarded as such.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government. The successful offerors will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders.  Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract. Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects will require incorporation of sustainable design features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven  proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, Management Approach and Small Business Subcontracting Effort. Phase I design factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects described above. Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed to Phase II. An 8a or HubZone contractor, only 1, who receives an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8a or HubZone contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HubZone contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  This successful 8a or HubZone contractor will compete on the seed project and all future task orders.  If the successful 8a or HubZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.   In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  The selected Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for award. The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of design-construction.  Price proposal may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options or additives with the Governments published budget for award. The offeror with the best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  The other IDIQ contract,s, will be awarded to the design-build offeror,s, who provide the best overall proposal for the seed project after the offeror who has been awarded a seed project has been removed from further competition.  A minimum guarantee of $25,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract,s, where a seed project was not awarded. After award of the initial contracts, the four successful contractors will compete for task orders based on either best value using the trade off process or low price technically acceptable to the government.  Task order statements of work may be written based on a Government-Contractor Team cooperative scoping of the work.  Some statements of work will include 100 percent plans and specifications and some will include Design-Build RFPs.  On-site walk-throughs will be conducted with the IDIQ contractors and appropriate government personnel to jointly access and determine a statement of work, to-do list, thereby developing a performance specification for the work. If the government issues the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest price; to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous  BEST VALUE to the Government. OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify, certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation. FOR SPECIFICATIONS-The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about February 26, 2004.  Phase I proposals will be due around March 27, 2004.  PHASE II WILL BE ISSUED AT A LATER DATE.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) intends to acquire from Ultra Electronics Ocean Systems of Braintree, Massachusetts 10 radio transmitter T-1630-SRT-SEPIRB buoys, PN 120624-5.  It would be prohibitively expensive for the Government to procure the SEPIRB buoy from a source other than Ultra Electronics Ocean Systems, Inc.  This is because an entirely new buoy package would have to be designed and built to meet the extensive requirements specified in the government’s SEPIRB functional requirements document.  The device would then have to pass all first article testing, which would include an at sea test aboard a submarine.  It would have to be pass the 9310 battery safety testing and would have to receive Type Approval from the COSPAS/SARSAT Secretariat for use as an emergency beacon.  Delivery is required 4 months after award of contract.  A firm-fixed-price contract under FAR Part 13 procedures is anticipated.  No formal solicitation will be issued.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Tumor Immunology & Biology (LTIB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with 
Biocon, Inc., 15801 Crabbs Branch Way, Rockville, Maryland 20855, services for animal care and maintenance, breeding, molecular testing and expansion of the MTAG Transgenic Mouse Model Colony of Mammary Carcinoma.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 112990 and the business size standard is $0.75M.  The Laboratory of Tumor Immunology at the National Cancer Institute, NIH has long been involved in the development and analysis of immunotherapy strategies against solid tumors, including recombinant viral-based vaccines and adoptive T cell transfer.  The ongoing evaluation of these strategies requires the production of more relevant preclinical animal models.  The model under investigation has a number of important characteristics that support that goal.  Biocon has provided animal care and maintenance for approximately 200 mice per month and the necessary breeding colonies.   Contractor Requirements:  Contractor shall be responsible for:  (1) the expansion and molecular testing of the colony for the identification of both transgene-positive and transgene-negative female mice; (2) monitoring primary tumor growth over time in specified experiments; (3) administering biologics and other reagents or compounds in anticancer therapy protocols; and (4) drawing blood for serum and CBC/differential determinations as potential diagnostic or prognostic markers of disease progression and/or regression.  It is also important to point out that transgene-negative female mice will be retained and used as age-matched controls where requested.  Period of Performance:  One year from date of award.  This requirement will be processed as an Indefinite-Delivery type order.   This procurement represents a continuation of work done through a prior contract (N02RC27014A), under which Laboratory of Tumor Immunology & Biology (LTIB) has been receiving professional services from Biocon for this particular mouse colony.    Biocon, Inc. is the only source known to the NCI that can provide female hemizygous mice that contain molecular characteristics that are required for continuity of experiments in progress and offspring.  The purpose of this acquisition with Biocon is to maintain and expand the transgenic breeding colony to investigate mechanistic questions in both tumor progression and antitumor therapy.  Because the female transgenic mouse of interest will be hemizygous, it will be necessary for Biocon to screen the offspring via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify the appropriate transgene-positive mice.  It is imperative to future research data and studies to obtain and continue current experiment in progress.  Failure to do so could invalidate the cornerstone of these important research projects, i.e., the accurate, timely and reliable assignment of transgenic mice for experimental studies focused on the development and analysis of immune-based therapeutic approaches to potentially intervene with malignant progression.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, February 26, 2004.

<DESC>The discovery, development, and evaluation of promising HIV microbicides is a high priority for the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH).  To augment the microbicide product pipeline, we are seeking opportunities to advance microbicide concepts toward the product stage via a focused, product development-based approach.  Specifically, the long-range goal of this solicitation is the development of new safe and effective microbicide candidates that merit further evaluation in large human trials. The HIV Microbicide Design and Development Teams (HMDDT) solicitation seeks to fund consortia of scientists with product development experience from industry and/or academia that have 1) identified a promising microbicide concept, and 2) devised a plan for its targeted development into a product testable in humans.  A microbicide product is defined here to be a material and its manner of administration that could reasonably provide protection against the sexual transmission of HIV safely, even when used repeatedly.  The expectation is that the Teams advance their microbicide concepts along a well-defined development path in a timely manner to a microbicide product and into clinical testing within the five-year period of the award.  Offerors are encouraged, but not required to conduct phase I/II trials in collaboration with the NIH/NIAID/DAIDS-supported HIV Prevention Trials Network (the HPTN; http://www.hptn.org). Support for Phase III studies will not be funded under this solicitation.  

Because the goal of this effort is the development of microbicide products, each Team will be required to demonstrate proven scientific and development expertise, and provide a comprehensive plan that lays out clearly defined objectives and milestones for the project’s duration.  Because the design and development path for any microbicide product cannot be entirely anticipated, the Team must articulate its vision of how new scientific findings will be integrated into the proposed goals and milestones.  Offerors will be required to articulate and implement a strategic research plan that includes: (a) key development objectives and a detailed work plan describing proposed time schedules for achieving contract objectives and milestones, and maintaining quality control over the implementation and operation of the contract, (b) how decisions to proceed or not proceed will be made (i.e. specific qualitative and quantitative criteria for product advancement through each stage of pre-clinical, including IND-enabling, development and Phase I/II safety evaluations), (c) plans for GMP microbicide lot production and packaging, and (d) obtaining the necessary regulatory and human subjects approvals to proceed.  This strategic plan shall articulate how the Team will efficiently allocate and utilize the resources, and redirect the focus (including reallocation of funds) depending upon the project’s changing needs and emerging new knowledge.  It shall, also, articulate how patent coverage and licensing of the resulting HIV microbicide will be obtained and the procedures to be followed for the resolution of potential legal issues that may arise.

It is anticipated that up to two (2) cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately February 15, 2005. RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIDS-04-04 will be available electronically on or about February 25, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

NIAID/CMP Home Page (via the WWW): Use http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract to access the NIAID/CMP Home Page.  Once at the NIAID/CMP Home Page, click on the "RFPs" link and then click on "RFP NIH-NIAID-DAIDS-04-04."

Please note that the RFP has been revised to include only the Work Statement, Deliverable and Reporting Requirements, Special Requirements, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and the Specific RFP Instructions and Provisions.  All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package. 

Responses to this RFP will be due on July 27, 2004.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal for consideration by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.   No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), the Joint Project Manger for Chemical, Medical, and Biological Systems (CBMS), and the Joint Project Manager for Guardian have a requirement for scientific, technical,  and acquisition management support services.  Services will support the missions in advanced research, development and acquisition, which includes developing, acquiring and fielding medical, biological and chemical defense technology systems and services.  Successful sources shall have knowledge of the above missions in addition to possessing skill in the area of scientific studies and analyses; long-range planning; preparing program and management documents; supporting program management; coordinating and presenting briefings; conducting seminars; developing databases, software and related automated information systems support, and coordination among DoD organizations. For this acquisition, the Government will be using the two-step sealed bid process.  Step  one requires the submission of a technical proposal.  In this first phase, interested companies will be required to submit an unpriced written technical proposal, which will be orally presented to the Government.  Upon conclusion of all oral presentations , all respondents with the greatest likelihood of success under a contract shall be invited to present a priced sealed bid.  In accordance with FAR 14.503-1 the Government will award a contract based on competitively priced bids for the services included i n the technical proposal.  For the purpose of awarding multiple contracts, including  two possible contracts to small businesses (one for each of the two groups identified for small business), the work scope is divided into four specific groups of service.   The categories of services are:  1.  Scientific and testing services; 2.  Other technical, which includes resource management and earned value management, logistics and information management; and 3. Other program management, including assistance in the development and oversight of program schedules, financial analysis and budget development, in Theater of Operations support, and host nation military support services; and 4. General administrative support. In accordance with FAR Part 10, market research i dentified small businesses capable of providing support services for groups two and four, i.e., for the following categories:  resource management, earned value management, logistics, information management, and administrative support.  These functions are  reserved for small business participation.  Groups one and three will be awarded using full and open competition. Notwithstanding the market research results, the Government reserves the right to award all services to large business if small business inte rest in this requirement is inadequate to ensure that the Government obtains best-in-class support.  For purposes of identifying the size standard, NAICS code 541710, 500 employees, applies to this acquisition.  A firm fixed priced contract with a base-per iod of 12-months, with four additional option years is planned.  The contract will also include an award term provision that could result in an additional five contract years of support services.  While the Government intends to exercise all of the availab le options, the decision to do so is the Government's sole right and could be based on continued need, available funding, and satisfactory performance.  The estimated date of release of the request for technical proposals is 30 days of this announcement. Performance of the contract requires a security clearance at the SECRET level.  All services shall be performed within Government spaces at Falls Church, VA; Frederick, MD; or Edgewood, MD.  The provisions of FAR 9.5, Organizational and Consultant Conflict s of Interest shall apply to this acquisition.  All participants must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration database to be eligible to receive a  contract award.  Foreign sources are excluded. Eligibility for receiving a request for technical proposal is contingent upon receipt of a written request from the prospective participant that includes a point of contact, an electronic and a postal mailing  address, cage code and identification of business size for the NAICS code identified in this synopsis.  All requests to receive a request for technical proposal must be received no later than the close of business on March 10, 2004.

This survey is not a Request for Proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. Responses to this survey are voluntary and at the responders expense; no costs associated with responding to this survey will be reimbursed. NAICS Codes and Small Business Size Standards for the purpose of this market survey are 541330 (Systems Engineering Services) and 541513 (Computer Related Services).   To be considered qualified to perform this effort, Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses(SEDB) that are 8(a) certified and other small businesses must clearly demonstrate experience and capability in accordance with the attached Labor Categories and Statement of Work. SEDB(8(a) certified) and other small businesses possessing the capability to perform the effort described are invited to submit a summary of those capabilities.  The summary should include evidence of the expertise, experience, knowledge, skills and abilities in each area. Responses to this market survey must include the attached Business Declaration Form and a copy of the firm's 8*a( certification letter. Only written responses of not more than 20 pages will be accepted; pamphlets and brochures are NOT desired. At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  In accordance with paragraph 5.3.4 of the Acquisition Management System, this market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set aside the competition among eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, small businesses (SEDB 8(a) certified and other small businesses) or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor's exclusion from the competition. However, the failure of adequate and appropriate SEDB 8(a) certified and/or small business particiation in this market survey will result in a full and open competition.      All responses must be received not later than close of Business (5:00 P.M. EDT) on February 26, 2004.  Please send responses by e-mail (word documents only) or commercial courier (FedEx, DHL, Airborne, etc).to barbara.kates@faa.gov or Federal Aviation Administration, Barbara A.

<DESC>CORRECTION TO PHASE I DUE DATE-THE PHASE I PROPOSAL DUE DATE HAS BEEN CHANGED TO 03 MARCH 2004 vs 15 MARCH 2004.
THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED AS ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FOUR SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY, IDIQ, DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8A OR HUBZONE FIRM AND THE OTHER THREE ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED. The Solicitation Number is N62467-04-R-0095. The NAICS Code for this Solicitation is 236220-Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The Size Standard is $28,500,000. Work covers general building type projects, new construction and renovations, including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for the Resident Officer in Charge of Construction Fort Worth, TX, area of responsibility. The work will be at the following primary locations-Naval Air Station-Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, TX, outlying reserve stations throughout eastern and central Texas.   Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal, RFP, procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered. It is the intent of the Government to award up to four contracts.  Each contract is for one year with four option years. The anticipated workload is $1-$10 million over the life of the four contracts, and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $30 million. Projects will vary in size from around $50,000 to $3 million with the average project in the $500,000 - $1.5 million range. One contract will be awarded with a seed project, and the remaining with a minimum guarantee of $25,000 each.  The seed project is JOINT RESERVES POLICE STATION, NAS-JRB FORT WORTH, TX.  The estimated range for the seed project is between $2,150,000 and $2,650,000.  This procurement will include a potential award for one 8a eligible or one HUBZone eligible firm. These firms will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II. If an 8a or HUBZone firm is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the solicitation will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such. The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract. Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government. Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement. Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract. All professional disciplines shall be registered and-or certified in their discipline. In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach. Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects-new construction and renovation-including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities. Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II. An 8a or HUBZone firm, only 1, that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II. If more than one 8a or HUBZONE firm receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HUBZone firm with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II. This successful 8a or HUBZone contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders. If the successful 8a or HUBZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract. In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals. Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award. The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction. Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award. The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one seed project. All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable. If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms. Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal. Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation. The Government intends to issue the solicitation on the WEB only. Phase I will be issued on or about 11 February 2004 with Phase I Proposals will due on or about 15 March 2004. Phase II will be issued at a later date.

Work covers general building type projects, new construction and renovations, including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for the Resident Officer in Charge of Construction Fort Worth, TX, area of responsibility. The work will be at the following primary locations-Naval Air Station-Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, TX, outlying reserve stations throughout eastern and central Texas.   Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal, RFP, procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered. It is the intent of the Government to award up to four contracts.  Each contract is for one year with four option years. The anticipated workload is $1-$10 million over the life of the four contracts, and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $30 million. Projects will vary in size from around $50,000 to $3 million with the average project in the $500,000 - $1.5 million range. One contract will be awarded with a seed project, and the remaining with a minimum guarantee of $25,000 each.  The seed project is JOINT RESERVES POLICE STATION, NAS-JRB FORT WORTH, TX.  The estimated range for the seed project is between $2,150,000 and $2,650,000.  This procurement will include a potential award for one 8a eligible or one HUBZone eligible firm. These firms will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II. If an 8a or HUBZone firm is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the solicitation will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such. The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract. Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government. Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement. Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract. All professional disciplines shall be registered and-or certified in their discipline. In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach. Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects-new construction and renovation-including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities. Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II. An 8a or HUBZone firm, only 1, that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II. If more than one 8a or HUBZONE firm receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HUBZone firm with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II. This successful 8a or HUBZone contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders. If the successful 8a or HUBZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract. In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals. Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award. The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction. Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award. The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one seed project. All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable. If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms. Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal. Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation. The Government intends to issue the solicitation on the WEB only. Phase I will be issued on or about 11 February 2004 with Phase I Proposals will due on or about 15 March 2004. Phase II will be issued at a later date.

<CONTACT>Erica White, Contract Technician, Phone (703) 292-5399, Fax (703) 292-9140/9141, Email ewhite@nsf.gov
<DESC>The New Initiatives Office of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. ("AURA") is interested in meeting with vendors in late February, 2004 for informal discussions in regarding the technical issues and options for developing deformable secondary mirrors for future giant telescopes.  These discussions will help to determine the feasibility, and the define the requirements of two Request’s for Proposals (RFP’s) tentatively scheduled to be released in mid-2004:

(1) The first RFP will seek qualified vendors and research institutions to develop a conceptual design for a complete deformable secondary mirror system with a 2-3 meter clear aperture diameter for a 30-meter class giant telescope.

(2) The second RFP will seek qualified vendors to design, fabricate, and test a 1-meter class subscale prototype mirror facesheet, using materials, fabrication technologies, and test methods that are scalable to aperture diameters of 2-3 meters.  

Both RFPs are concerned with deformable secondary mirrors for use with adaptive optics (AO) in astronomy.  Adaptive optics (AO) systems remove distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence by making corrections to the incoming wavefront using one or multiple light sources as references.  Deformable secondary mirrors are an attractive   option for introducing these corrections, since they minimize the number of optical surfaces in the AO system and thereby improve throughput and minimize emissivity.  Depending on the application, telescope design, and site, our current estimates for the requirements of such a deformable mirror for a 30-meter class giant telescope include a 2-4 meter clear aperture diameter, a 2-dimensional array of actuators with 20 to 100 actuators across the diameter of the mirror, an actuator stoke of from 15 mm (with separate tip/tilt correction) to 60 mm (with tilt correction included), and mirror update rates of from 100 to 1000 Hz.  AURA is interested in meeting with vendors to discuss the potential feasibility of these requirements, as well as the design options for face sheet thickness, face sheet material, segmented vs. continuous face sheets, actuator technology, actuator influence functions, optical test methods, and face sheet surface quality and roughness.

The two RFPs will be administered by AURA through the New Initiatives Office in partnership with the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project.

Interested parties should contact Andy Commissaris (Tel: 520-318-8241; Fax: 520-318-8560; email: andyc@noao.edu) with their contact information and availability for a teleconference and/or a face-to-face meeting to be located in Tucson, Arizona during the last week of February and/or first week of March 2004.  A list of topics for discussion and additional information on deformable secondary mirror requirements and their applications for future giant telescopes may be found at http://www.aura-nio.noao.edu.  A list of topics for discussion may be found under the topic “What’s New”. 

The Contracting Office for this requirement is AURA-NOAO, 950 N. Cherry Ave, Tucson, AZ  85719.  Please contact Andy Commissaris (Tel: 520-318-8241; Fax: 520-318-8560; email: andyc@noao.edu) regarding this notice.

<CONTACT>Sandra OConnell, 301-619-2895
<DESC>The purpose of this modification/amendment, is to provide answers to questions received regarding the subject Request for Technical Proposals, Step one of Two Step Sealed Bid.  As a result of this modification, the response due date is hereby extende d to 27 Feb 2004. 1.  QUESTION:  Will the polyclonal antibodies be antigen affinity purified or purified IgG? ANSWER :  Affinity purification will be done by the Government not the contractor. These are just protein A purified antibodies. 2.  QUESTION:  Will the hybridoma cell lines provided come with any certificate with regard to health?  For example, will they be certified mycoplasm free?   ANSWER:  No 3.  QUESTION:  How long after award of contract will the sera be shipped for purification and at what rate? ANSWER:  Upon issuance of a Delivery Order. 4.  a.  QUESTION:  How long after award of contract will the hybridoma cell lines be shipped for ascites production?   ANSWER:  Upon issuance of a Delivery Order. b.  QUESTION:   Will all cell lines be shipped at once?  ANSWER:  No, see above  c. QUESTION:  Will historical ascites yields (volume and monoclonal secretion) be provided for technical and financial proposal submission?  Without this information, technical levels of effort and associated financial estimates may be grossly over or unde r estimated.  ANSWER:  No these will not be provided until contract award/issuance of Delivery Orders. 5.  a.  QUESTION:  What will the acceptance criteria be for the delivered antibodies?  The government is providing the sera, therefore all the contractor should prove is that the IgG was purified from the sera.  ANSWER:  Government-designated laboratories shall conduct independent evaluations of antibodies manufactured by the Contractor prior to formal acceptance of product utilizing an activity assay based on an ELISA and adjusted for antibody content versus gold  standard antibody. b. QUESTION:  What will the acceptance time period be by the government such that the contractor may invoice for payment?  ANSWER:   Commercial practices. 6. QUESTION:  What monoclonal antibody isotypes are expected to be secreted by the government furnished hybridoma cells?  Will any be IgG or IgM?  IgG3?   ANSWER:  All will be IgGÃ¢Â€Â™s with one possible IgA.  Ã¢Â€Â˜7.  QUESTION:  It is suggested that the contractor be supplied government antigen for in-house pre and post purification acceptance and validation.  We feel that this is technically sound.  It will give the government the most streamlined, cost effec tive products.  In this case, will a CDC license be required to perform these tasks?  ANSWER:  No this is not within scope 8. QUESTION:  The word Ã¢Â€ÂœcodedÃ¢Â€Â is utilized in the announcement.  It is suggested that eligible companies possess a current facility clearance to the secret level and that as a minimum the project manager possess a current personnel clearance leve l of secret.  This would be a requirement since acceptance criteria would have to name the target antigen if data needs to be shared between the testing facility and contractor.   ANSWER:  No clearance is required.  The reference to Ã¢Â€ÂœcodedÃ¢Â€Â in the Request for Technical Proposal was in error and should read Ã¢Â€ÂœuncodedÃ¢Â€Â. 9.  QUESTION:   Page 3 of the solicitation refers to a Ã¢Â€Âœdata sheet attachedÃ¢Â€Â for describing past performance. There does not seem to be a link to access the data sheet. Please clarify.  ANSWER:   The Data Sheet is included in the last section of the Request for Technical Proposal.  10. QUESTION:  The monoclonal antibodies are to be aliquoted in 50 cc tube.  We feel this would not be practical for the polyclonal due to the volume.  Are one liter containers sufficient for polyclonals? ANSWER:  Yes. End of modification

The USAID Representative to Yemen.

S/He will be expected to coordinate and collaborate with the Embassy’s Pubic Diplomacy Economic and Cultural Affairs unit.  

D.        STRATEGY AND CONTEXT
 
1.	     USAID/Yemen Interim Strategy, 2003-2006 

In May 2003, an interim strategy was approved for Yemen.  The interim strategy contains the following framework for a newly established economic growth component:
Agency Objective: Broad-based Economic Growth and Agricultural Development Encouraged
Strategic Objective 279-007:  Increased Income Opportunities and Food Security in Selected Governorates
IR 7.1	Expanded Sustainable Production of Rural Economic Products for the Market and Home Consumption
IR 7.2	Expanded Markets for Rural Economic Products 
IR 7.3  Improved Framework for Economic Growth

2.	Context:  

Yemen is a crucial ally in the US-led war against terrorism. The capacity of Yemen to fulfill its role as an ally, however, is dependent upon its ability to decrease poverty and improve its overall economic performance.  According to a 1998 World Bank study, 18% of the Yemeni population live in absolute poverty, and 42% of the population are incapable of meeting their food and non-food requirements. Most of Yemen’s poor live in the countryside, who rely to a large degree on imported food, at subsidized prices.  Oil income, an important component to the national economy, is forecasted to decline steadily well into the future and will soon be a negligible source of foreign earnings. 
  
Agriculture:  Yemen is predominantly rural (75%) and the agricultural sector plays an important role in the Yemeni economy, not because of its contribution to GDP – though small and declining (24% of GDP in 1990 - 15% in 2000) – but because it provides employment to more than half (61%) of the labor force, livelihood to more than three-quarters of the population, and contributes about a third of total non-oil merchandize exports.     

Potential for growth in key sectors: The  World Bank believes that “rapid employment-generating economic growth (in Yemen) will only be possible if agriculture, fishing, tourism and manufacturing lead the way.  (However) Rising domestic security concerns, excessive and arbitrary regulations in infrastructure and services, weak legal and judicial systems, and difficulties in securing land titles hamper output expansion in most of these sectors”…(furthermore)…”reliance on domestic demand limits the prospects for faster and sustained GDP growth.  The impact of policy reforms (flexibility of the exchange rate and trade liberalization) made a significant impact on the competitiveness and good performance of exports.  Such gains need to be preserved and enhanced by deeper liberalization and improvement in trade-related infrastructure and services.”  

Trade:  Yemen is considered by the World Bank to be among the most open and trade liberalized countries in
the MENA region. Nonetheless, most of Yemen’s current non-oil exports remain primary, low value-added
products which also make economic growth more vulnerable to volatility in price and demand.  

Government Policy:  The ROYG would like to improve human capacity particularly among women, enhance
living standards, lower population growth rates, diversify the economy away from dependence on oil revenue,
and raise per capita income. 

Structural Adjustment:  US$550 million in financing was extended to Yemen from 1995-2001 by the World Bank, the IMF and bilateral donors to support a ROYG economic reform process that resulted in a unified and liberalized the exchange regime, reduced subsidies on fuels and wheat, a restructured banking sector, simplified and liberalized trade, a reduced external debt burden, and improve monetary policy and control.  In an October 2002 meeting in Paris, donors pledged a US$2.3bn economic support package to support the Yemen poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF) for economic development.  Key elements in phase two include: strengthening governance, civil service reform, decentralization, judicial reform, fiscal revenue and expenditure reform including tax system reform to broaden the tax base and enhance revenue collection and reductions in non-productive spending including diesel oil subsidies which cost 3% of GDP. 

3.	USAID Development Response

Although the primary concentration in SO-007 will be on the agriculture sector USAID will allocate some funds for technical assistance to the ROYG to investigate opportunities for expanded exports and trade and to support the ROYG Central Statistical Office to improve data for development planning.  The activities under SO 297-007 are illustrated within the three Intermediate Results in the Strategy: 

IR 7.1	Expanded Sustainable Production of Rural Economic Products for the Market and Home Consumption

USAID will assist GoY to improve crop and livestock specification and improve growing techniques; reduce wastage; improve access to inputs (e.g. seeds, feed); support community-based producers associations; expand access to electricity; assist businesses that support the agriculture sector; technical support to women food producers for consumption in the home through community-based outreach.            

IR 7.2	Expanded Markets for Rural Economic Products 
  
USAID will support improved access to infrastructure (e.g. electricity, roads) for agricultural related businesses;  improve product quality, processing and packaging; support private sector marketing co-ops; expanded access to credit; market research and development; marketing and advertising; expanding regional and international partnerships.          

IR 7.3  Improved Framework for Economic Growth 

USAID will assist Yemeni higher education and research institutions to support the private sector in agriculture and business; establish business information centers; technical assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture and other Ministries and to district and governorate agriculture and economic development offices; targeted research to identify opportunities to expand exports and increase investment in new businesses; technical assistance to assist the ROYG increase trade opportunities; technical assistance to ROYG at all national, governorate and district levels to collect and use agriculture and other commercial data for planning.

 SOLICITATION NUMBER: RFP# 279-04-005
 ISSUANCE DATE: February 11, 2004
 CLOSING DATE/TIME: 4:30 pm Cairo time on March 16, 2004
 POSITION TITLE: Senior Education Advisor               
 MARKET VALUE:  GS-14 
 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 2 years with possibility of extension. 
 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/Sana’a, Yemen. 
 SECURITY ACCESS: SECRET
 AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens or U.S. resident alien who are able to obtain a secret security clearance.

A. ORGANIZATIONAL LOCATION OF POSITION:  Office of the USAID Representative, US Embassy, Sana’a, Yemen

B. 	POSITION TITLE OF DIRECT SUPERVISOR:
The USAID Representative to Yemen. 

C.	SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:  The Senior Education Advisor will work in tandem with the Education Program Specialist (FSN) to form the USAID/Yemen Education Support Team. The USAID Representative will review and approve the contractor’s work plan and performance measures. The incumbent will be expected to work independently, take initiative, and be responsible for advising on all aspects of USG supported education program activities.  In carrying out specific assignments, the incumbent will work closely with senior representatives from The Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG), international donor organizations, local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and senior U.S. Government (USG) officials at the US Embassy/Sana’a, USAID/Cairo and USAID/Washington.   S/He will be expected to coordinate and collaborate with the Embassy’s Pubic Diplomacy Education and Cultural Affairs unit.  


D.	STRATEGY AND CONTEXT

1.	The USAID Yemen Interim Strategy for 2003-2006

In May 2003, an interim strategy was approved for Yemen.  The interim strategy contains the following framework for the educational support component:
Agency Objective: Human Capacity Built through Education and Training
Strategic Objective 297-006:  Improved Basic Education, Especially for Women and Girls
IR 6.1:  Enhanced Access to Quality Primary Education in the Public Sector
IR 6.2:  Increased Literacy and Numeracy Opportunities at the Community Level   
IR 6.3: Improved Public Sector Environment for Education   

2.	Context 

Limited levels of education and literacy are a human capital constraint to economic development in Yemen.  In the rural areas where three-fourths of Yemeni’s live, 68% of men and 94% of women have had no formal education at all or have failed to complete primary school. Most (91%) of ever-married rural women are illiterate and most do not compensate by getting information from either radio or television. 

Access:  Education attainment in Yemen is among the lowest in the world.  Although an estimated 2.6 million children are in primary school, about half (approximately 2.5 million) of the primary-school age children (age group between 6 and 11 years old) are not in school.  Gender disparity is pronounced.  In 2001 the Primary Education Net Enrollment Rate (NER) was 61.3% among boys compared to 41.1 % among girls.  According to the 1999 National Poverty Survey, only 45% of rural primary age children (age group between 6 and 11) were currently enrolled in formal schooling, while 71% of urban children were enrolled.  Rural female students are the most disadvantaged (30% enrolled), compared to the urban female students (71% enrolled).   Finally, the retention rate for female students is only 33 percent compared to 68 percent for male students.

Quality: To some extent the poor quality of primary education reflects the low qualification of teachers, especially in rural areas.  The 2000/01 Education Survey estimates that only 40 percent of teaching staff hold secondary school certificates or better, the balance (60% of teachers) have completed only basic education, with one or two years of additional training.  The primary school curriculum and textbooks have been updated recently but the majority of grade 4-6 students have difficulty relating what they have learned in the classroom to what they observe in their environment; explaining and interpreting the meaning of phenomena due to the lack experimentation in school; in mental calculations to resolve problems; and reading and interpreting tables and graphs; and most students have limited reading and writing skills.  Although in-service teacher training is being expanded, primary education still faces serious difficulties, including inadequate school buildings, shortage of teaching and learning materials, and weak community involvement and regional shortages of teachers, especially in rural areas.

Government of Yemen Policy:  

The Government  of Yemen (GOY) Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) states that  education is a key driver for economic and social development, and sustainable human development.  Basic education is considered essential for rural development and the agricultural sector, and is fundamental to increase industrial productivity.  The teaching of girls is an important factor to improve maternal and infant health and nutrition, as well as to reduce fertility, and to bring about social change in women’s position in society.  Thus, the education strategy in Yemen focuses on four basic principles:  (i) improve the quality of education; (ii) improve the management of the sector and the orientation towards decentralization; (iii) give priority to basic education; and (iv) focus on girls’ education, with the aim of increasing the overall enrollment rate. 

3.	USAID Development Response

The following are illustrative activities in the education sector from the USAID Interim Strategy:
 
IR 6.1	Enhanced Access to Quality Primary Education in the Public Sector
The USAID program will construct, renovate and equip a limited number of elementary schools in partnership with community organizations with special attention to physical constraints to girls’ participation (e.g. separate latrines).   The majority of construction, rehabilitation and equipment will be supported by the USDA 416(b) local currency program.   To improve the quality of education, USAID will also train teachers (especially female teachers) and administrators with an emphasis on interactive, inquiry -based, teaching methods.  USAID will also explore opportunities to provide nutrition and other incentives to increase enrolment and retain children in school through other USDA programs (e.g. Food for Education).

IR 6.2	Increased Literacy and Numeracy  Opportunities at the Community Level 
With large numbers of children out of school (especially girls) and virtually all rural women uneducated and illiterate,  USAID education activities must reach out and provide life-experience-relevant, essential literacy and numeracy opportunities in rural communities.  USAID will increase education outreach to adults (especially women) and out-of-school youth in rural communities; radio/video distance-learning activities; organize parents’ and women’s education circles, community-based organizations and teacher/parent committees. 
 
IR 6.3	Improved Public Sector Environment for Education   
	USAID will develop and implement district and governorate education plans with community participation; fund education planning and program grants; promote new teaching approaches such as interactive and inquiry-based, learning; improve policies and regulations; include life-skills in the curriculum; develop policies and activities for out-of-school youth; provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Education and to district and governorate education offices to implement the ROYG decentralization objects and the ROYG Basic Education Strategy; provide technical assistance to ROYG at all levels to collect, use and share education data for planning and management; explore IT applications to support program objectives.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. This is not a request for a formal proposal.  The anticipated NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $6M.

This synopsis seeks to identify contractors that can assist the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Office of Drug Safety (ODS) in expanding its access to medical error data resources, to complement our current adverse event databases. This data will be used by FDA staff to better assess a medical error event, both in quantitative and qualitative terms.  This effort is a response to the ongoing initiatives identified in the Quality Interagency Coordination Task Force Report (QuIC response to the IOM report) dated February 2000.  The QuIC report, in part, charged FDA with the tasks of developing standards associated with proprietary drug name confusion, labeling and packaging to prevent dosing and drug mix-ups and medication errors; and, to strengthen FDA’s overall analytical capabilities.  To assist in performing these initiatives, ODS is interested in acquiring direct access to one centralized data system integrating multiple information systems from either US hospitals, health maintenance organizations, long-term care facilities, home care, or other components of health care systems representing potential and actual medical errors.  For the purpose of this requirement, medical errors include, but are not limited to, medication errors, laboratory errors, surgical errors, and/or device errors. 

The FDA intends to use Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) data in addition to these data to strengthen our internal safety analysis on medical errors.  This analysis may lead to a regulatory action with a pharmaceutical or device company.  The ability of FDA to respond expeditiously to the increasing number of critical issues associated with medical errors is of paramount importance to the overall public safety.  The addition of these data would complement and strengthen the utility of the voluntary and mandatory reporting systems currently in place. Access to these data will increase FDA’s capability to perform regulatory impact studies to better understand and improve standards for medical product naming, labeling, packaging, and design.

Program Research Goals: 

Provide direct access to a medical error data resource with the capability of providing root cause and trend analysis.
Provide FDA personnel with unlimited, Internet access to these data in a multi-user environment and in real-time.
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to retrieve reports that are driven by certain selection parameters (e.g. health system setting, product name, product specific information [strength, dosage form, etc.] date of error, type and cause of the error, and patient outcome). 
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to query and obtain aggregate reports for the purpose of conducting medical error evaluations.  
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to broadcast global safety messages to the health system users of the medical error database for the purpose of seeking reports for certain adverse events that have been previously identified by FDA (item is desirable but not required).

To assist FDA in achieving these objectives, a two-month, no cost trial subscription to the full, commercially available data resource shall be required.

Interested parties shall submit a capability statement not to exceed 10 pages no later than August 15, 2003 to one of the following addresses:  Via U.S. Mail: Food and Drug Administration, OAGS/DSCI/HFA-505 Attn: Katharine Minker, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.  
Via FedEx or Other Delivery Service: Food and Drug Administration, OAGS/DSCI/HFA-505 Attn: Katharine Minker, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 2121,  Rockville, MD 20852.

<DESC>The 45 Space Wing issues this sources sought synopsis for information and planning purposes in support of the possible acquisition of environmental and ultra-trace forensic analysis services.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the government pay for information solicited.  The services to be acquired are primarily concerned with separation, manipulation, analysis, and identification of micron particulate matter for the purpose of nuclear test ban treaty verification.  Definition of some terms: sample = physical object requiring processing to isolate particles of interest for analysis;  particle = singular microscopic item of interest requiring analysis for elemental, morphological, and isotopic information.  Forensic analysis  requires the ability to:  (a) process and analyze samples provided by the government; (b) process and analyze 6,000 particles per year from as many as 300 samples per year; (c) perform thermal ion mass spectrometry analysis of 6,600 particles per year; (d) perform nondestructive screening of up to 200 samples per year and characterize, using standard geometries, 30 samples per year by gamma spectroscopy; (e) identify isotopes of interest present in the sample using high resolution gamma spectroscopy; (f) perform secondary ion mass spectroscopy isotopic and elemental analysis on 50 samples per year; (g) maintain all processing areas and microscope clean rooms in accordance with the current General Services Administration standards for clean room and workstation requirements; (h) maintain class 100 clean room techniques sufficient to ensure no cross-contamination between samples; (i) describe and characterize sample particle isotopics, morphologies, elemental and molecular compositions using all available analytical techniques; (j) maintain the capability to perform isotopic and elemental analyses via scanning techniques such as microscope, electron microprobe, or ion beam; and (k) provide stoichiometry information on selected particles.  Other requirements include:  (a) in the event the Government elects to procure environmental and ultra-trace forensic analysis services, prospective sources must possess, or show the capability to obtain, a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Radioactive Materials License (or an agreement state license/permit, as applicable for the facility where work will be performed), prior to performance start; (b) offerors shall be responsible for providing a suitable site for performance of the contract requirements.  Unique mission essential analysis equipment will be provided, with ownership retained by the government.  Due to the potential of contaminating mission samples, analysis equipment and areas of any facility used for environmental and ultra-trace forensic analysis services shall not be used for activities other than AFTAC work without the expressed written permission of the government program office and shall be isolated from other facilities doing nuclear work; and (c) prospective sources would be required to have DOD security clearances of at least the SECRET NO FOREIGN level.  Participation in this potential effort would require both a facilities and storage capability of at least the SECRET NO FOREIGN level. Prospective sources would be required to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET NO FOREIGN level.  A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is contemplated with a one-year basic contract period and four 1-year options.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541380/$10.0 million.  No technical or solicitation documents exist at this time.  Interested offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.  Firms must respond electronically to Ms Lois Brockson at lois.brockson@patrick.af.mil within 15 calendar days from the date of publication.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  Firms responding must state whether they are a Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), an 8(a) firm, a Native American firm, a HUBZone firm, a Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a participant in the Very Small Business Pilot Program, or a large business based on the size standard above.  The government reserves the right to set this acquisition aside for any of the above type organizations based on the responses received.

<DESC>Overview

The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is seeking to replace its current Access Control and Alarm Monitoring System (ACAMS) and its Video Badging System (VBS) with new, state-of-the-art turnkey systems, at the Washington, D.C. Facility (WDC). The new systems should be flexible and expandable enough so that other GPO satellite facilities, if the need arises, could be added seamlessly at the discretion of GPO. ONLY GSA SCHEDULE HOLDERS NEED TO RESPOND.

The ACAMS shall include and be fully integrated with the new VBS for the producing of identification cards for both employees and visitors.  The ACAMS shall interface with the GPO’s existing Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) system for instant camera call-up associated with alarm activation, and shall provide and interface with a Digital Video Recording System (DVRS) for automatic recording of alarm events at WDC or elsewhere as needed by GPO.  ACAMS shall allow expandability of the CCTV system with additional state of the art television cameras, multiplexers and digital recording devices as needed.   The ACAMS and VBS software shall be able to run under Windows TM Server 2000 or later. 

All hardware should be warranted for one year after the system is  “turned on” and accepted by GPO.  Cost should be provided for two to five year maintenance warranty if only one year initial warranty is provided.  All software should receive free upgrades for at least one year.  GPO personnel will install card reader and alarm devices, as well as pull necessary wire for electricity, CCTV, or data. If GPO personnel need to be trained by the vendor to be able to install and maintain the selected system, that cost should be quoted.  Selected vendor will be expected to provide training to users of the VBS and the ACAMS at least once prior to it being turned on.

Specifics

The VBS should consist of both hardware and software for the production of ID cards that may incorporate bar codes, magnetic strips, and smart chips. This technology should also include the feasibility of using the card as a Combined Access Card (conforming to the NIST standards for a combined access card) when this feature becomes available government wide. It should allow the use of non-proprietary ID card stock (plain, proximity, or smart cards) that utilizes dye-sub printers (Ability to also print to paper stock on Windows ™ compatible printers is considered a plus). Printers should be capable of printing on both sides of ID card and should have capability of adding lamination to ID card should that be desired. The VBS should have a searchable ODBC compliant data base of all persons having ID cards, and be able to accept input from signature recording devices, as well as, photos input from video cameras or imported jpeg files or other standard file types.  The software should allow for password protected levels of access, such that GPO police officers at different entrance gates can access the system to observe photos of employees to verify identification, but not necessarily other levels of the system.  Software should allow for more than one ID card design to be selected at printing time for control purposes.  Software should allow for batch printing when needed, and for purging of files based on any data item.  It should also allow for collection of data items that may not be printed to the ID card.  The software should allow printing of bar codes, and allow printing of ID photos to plain paper when needed for police or control functions.  The software should import the currently used database (Card Key product) or a conversion program should be provided to do so.  The system must be capable of integrating with other ODBC data bases over a network if the need arises.

The ACAMS should include up to 6 gates (at least one of which must be a SafeSec type revolving door/gate) at the entrances to the building that open by ID cards prepared on the VBS.  At least one gate at each entrance should be ADA compliant.  All gates should impede unauthorized entry, including attempted piggybacking, but allow unimpeded rapid entry to authorized ID card holders during peak times.  Gates should comply with zoning requirements for exit during emergencies.  The ACAMS should accept input from at least one hundred proximity or smart card readers as well as biometric devices, and quotes for a biometric fingerprint reader should be provided..  System should allow for readers with memory to be placed at selected locations, to allow access even if the reader loses contact with the computer.  The ACAMS should accept alarm input from door contact devices, motion sensors or other standard alarm devices.

ACAMS software should allow assigning ID cards to security groups of card readers and allow sub-groups within groups.   That ability should be password protected.  It should provide for opening of doors on command from the GPO Police console, under password protection.  System should provide auditing of all system access, not only by device input, but also access or attempted access by personnel, with audit logs viewable by system administrator.  The ACAMS should have anti-passback capabilities.  Unauthorized access attempts should be considered an alarm condition at least at the GPO Police console.  An audible alarm should sound at the GPO Police console for any alarm received by the ACAMS system.  The system should keep password protected logs of gate access by individuals, and alarms, that are viewable real time from a console, as well as archived.  Software should allow designation of holidays and prevent designated groups access on those holidays, or other selected days.  The ACAMS should be usable on a closed network, and be able to connect to at least ten desktop computers, and include any software needed to do so.  

Alarms received by ACAMS should cause designated cameras to pan to display the area of the alarm if not allowed by digital video recorders also to be procured by GPO.  PTZ cameras must be able to be controlled from the GPO Police console, as well as other designated computers if desired.  

The above meets the minimum requirements for the proposed access control system for the Government Printing Office. Furthermore, a necessary point is that the system is capable of utilizing current card readers and control devices of the current accesss control system (Card Key) and allow for later upgrade to more up to date equipment as the need may arise. Responses should be submitted to Sheila Williams via fax 202-512-1354 no later than March 02, 2004, 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.  Please include your name, address, phone number and fax number.

<SUBJECT>A -- Josephson-Junctin Quantum Bits
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST)  proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the Colorado College for a scanned probe microscopy investigation of Josephson Junction qubit Insulators.  As part of an ongoing research project to build a solid-state quantum computer using Josephson Junctions, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), plans to support a program of study to investigate candidate materials for Josephson-junction quantum bits by means of scanned probe microscopies.  The quantum computer project requires achievement of longer coherence times for the JJ-qubits, and recent data indicates that the nanoscale materials properties of the junctions are a potential source of decoherence.  Scanned probe microscopies represent a direct and optimal means to characterize and understand these properties.  This program will use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to investigate the atomic scale topography, and conducting atomic force microscopy (CAFM) to investigate the nanometer scale topography and simultaneous local conductance.  In the initial stage of this work, an existing NIST SPM will be configured for these studies.  Subsequently the methodology will be transferred to a new UHV STM/AFM expected to be operational at NIST in the summer of 2004. Qualifications include knowledge, as evidenced by publications, of (1) the use of scanned probe microscopies to study complex materials including those appropriate for use in JJ-qubits, and of (2) the issues surrounding the coherence of JJ qubits.  The place of performance will be the NIST Boulder labs and the period of performance will be 3 months.  It is the government's belief that the skills of the researcher engaged by the Colorado College uniquely qualify them for this work.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and Conditions can be found on http://www.arnet.gov/far/ and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/reflib/alp1296.htm.  A copy in full text is available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date February 27, 2004.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation, but rather a Request for Information.  The Information Technology, E-Commerce & Commercial Contracting Center Ã¢Â€Â“ West (ITEC4-W), located at Fort Huachuca, AZ is seeking input from potential sources relative to the foll owing requirement.  Requirement:  Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) is in the process of identifying a solution for remote access to the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s fixed based network infrastructure.  The solution must provide for worldwide dial-up, wired br oadband, and wireless broadband access for all Army remote users.  Additionally, VPN (Virtual Private Network), Radius, and CAC (Common Access Card) authentication technologies must be incorporated into the solution.  The Army currently provides world wide  remote dial-up access using TSACS (Terminal Server Access Controller System).  However, due to Army remote network applications requiring increased demand for higher bandwidths, the Army must rely on broadband services.  Remote locations where wired acces s points are not available, wireless access points are also needed.  In doing so, commercial infrastructure must be relied upon since Army network infrastructure does not extend into all commercial broadband wired and wireless access points worldwide. Inte rested firms should provide a solution for a worldwide dial-up, wired broadband, and wireless broadband capability to the Army.  Interested firms should submit their written responses to the Contract Specialist, Cynthia Hall, via email:  cynthia.hall@netco m.army.mil, no later than 12 March 2004.  Any questions or concerns, please contact the Contracting Officer, Linda Van Collie at 520-533-0433, Contract Specialist at 520-533-0363 or Technical Point of Contact, Mr. Peter E.

OMBUDSMAN NOTICE - NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:  Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285

<DESC>The 30th Space Wing, Vandenberg AFB, CA, is soliciting offers to purchase a self-contained cabinet style dust collector rated to handle 9500AACFM at 8 inch W.G. external static pressure. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation reference number is FA4610-04-Q-0002 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation. This solicitation incorporates Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-18. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 421830 and the size standard is 500 employees. This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside. Line item 0001 - American Air Filter Arrestall Model AR-75; or equal - Qty 1 each, to include the following specifications: Dust-ladened air enters below the cartridge area, changes direction 90 degrees and flows through cartridge filter pockets. This change in direction causes separation and deposition of larger, heavier particles directly into the dust storage device, reducing the dust load to the filter cartridge. Finer particles are collected on the filter cartridge. Air is channeled by pocket separators directly upward in a laminar flow pattern, gathered by the fan inlet cone, and exhausted by the BI fan wheel through the acoustically lined fan scroll top outlet. Collected dust is periodically discharged from the filter cartridge surface by the high-energy automatic shaker and falls into the dust disposal area below. Overall construction shall be of galvanneal steel for maximum corrosion resistance. The exterior shall be finish coated with a vinyl lacquer. Cartridge and fan access shall be through full height doors with quick opening, flush latches for speed and security. The unit shall also include a 1/4 inch plate motor mounting bracket assembly with lifting lug openings. Standard construction includes external combination weather cover/silencer with drilled outlet for return air connection. Fan shall be backward inclined for non-overloading operation. Fan wheel shall be constructed of aluminum and shall be fitted with a scroll for maximum efficiency and quiet operation. It shall be belt driven by a 30 HP (230/460/60/3) 1725 rppm TEFC motor. Fan motor starters shall be included as part of quotation. Both fan and motor shall be dynamically balanced for smooth vibration free operation. The outlet area shall be lined with a strong smooth fiberglass laminated mat for sound attenuation. This liner shall be designed for temperatures of up to 250 degrees F, and shall meet the fire resistance requirements of NFPA 90A and 90B. Filter Cartridge shall consist of individual pockets sewn from on piece of 8.2-ounce cotton sateen fabric designed to deliver in excess of 99% efficiency by weight on fine industrial dusts. Filter cartridge shall have rigid corrugated separators to prevent pocket collapse and to channel cleaned air in a laminar flow profile into fan inlet cone. Adjacent pockets shall be positioned by steel bars at the top and flat shaker fingers at the bottom to prevent mutual blank off and to maintain the dust cake collection area. A total of 6 filter cartridges shall supply 792 sq. ft. of filter area. Cartridge shall be fitted over a galvanized steel locking frame and all separators securely positioned by a galvanized steel retainer resulting in a tight pocket assembly to minimize pressure drop and maximize dust release. Each cartridge assembly shall be locked in place by two lever actuated over-center cam assemblies, which force the steel header frame securely against a 3/4 inch x1.5 inch neoprene gasket surface. Automatic Filter Cleaning shall be delivered by two (2) horizontal contact systems that shall distribute shaking force throughout each individual filter pocket. Pockets shall be held tightly by flat shaker fingers which impart an acceleration equal to a minimum of 7 Gs from motorized 3/4 HP eccentric driven shaker assemblies. Operation of the automatic shakers shall be controlled by a solid state printed circuit board UL/CSA approved using a dual timer mode. It shall include an adjustable fan delay cycle and an adjustable shaker cycle. Overall system control shall be designed for initiation by a hand-off auto switch for maximum operator flexibility. Funnel Bottom Design shall include a steed 45 degree funnel terminating in a 12 inch diameter drum connection device without slide gates or doors to permit immediate down flow of dislodged dust into the dust disposal container. This should be approximately 6 feet from the ground to accommodate the 500-gallon plastic trash receptacles used here on Vandenberg AFB. The additional height can be obtained by using longer corner post. Line item 0002 - Explosion vents shall consist of factory installed rear door panels with Brixton spring type latches and guards. Latches are factory set and field adjustable; or equal - Qty 1 each. Line item 0003 - Factory pre-wired controls (NEMA 4) shall be supplied with hand/off/auto switch and control transformer including fan motor starters to match the fan motor voltage and horsepower and pre-wired to the automatic shakers for a single point electrical connection. Starter shall be Allen-Bradley type; or equal - Qty 1 each. Delivery shall be made within 10 weeks after date of contract.
