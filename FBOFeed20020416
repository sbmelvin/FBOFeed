<DESC>The Coastal Systems Station, Dahlgren Division, NSWC, Panama City, FL 32407-7001 intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to the University of Virginia (UVA) Impact Biomechanics Program (UVA IBP) for development biodynamic models that can be used to predict human dynamic response to various inputs, applicable to the complex seated, leaning, and standing postures assumed by the Special Operations Craft occupants.  This purchase order is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The University of Virginia (UVA) Impact Biomechanics Program (UVA IBP) possesses the unique knowledge and skills to perform the work required.  The UVA IBP has had long-term exposure to the NSW combatant craft community through visits and interviews with Special Boat Squadron boat operators and medical officers over the past several years.  The UVA IBP possesses u nique and in-depth experience with the selected lumped-mass whole body model; specifically the MADYMO model developed by TNO, Inc.  UVA, moreover, was selected by TNO, Inc. to participate in development of the model. The UVA IBP possesses unique algorithms and capability to process the 6-DOF dynamics data and synchronized video to extract low frequency roll and pitch head/hip degrees of freedom data.   The UVA IBP possesses unique algorithms to analyze time-synchronized video to develop an improved understanding of the relationship between dynamics and injury in the NSW combatant craft environment.  For these reasons, the UVA IBP is uniquely qualified to perform the work described in SOW Human Impact Biodynamics Modeling. There are no other known sources that could accomplish this effort without a significant learning curve delay and additional expense to the Government.  The N AICS is 541710 and small business size standard is 500 employees.  This synopsis can be found at:  www.ncsc.navy.mil/contracts/ztables/syntable.htm.

FAR 6.302-1,  "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" permits other than full and open competition.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (Request for Quotations) is available.  All  interested parties who believe they can provide the required services may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability for consideration by the agency within 15 days of this notice to: U.S. EPA, Attn: Barbara Nelson (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research  Triangle Park, NC 27711.  No telephonic requests will be honored.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to satisfy this requirement.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination  that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine that competition is feasible, a purchase order will be placed with Dr. Henry.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  This technology presents a novel visualization technique to align whole genomes. The basic design combines the descriptive power of pixel-based visualizations with the interpretative strength of digital image-processing filters.  The innovative use of pixel enhancement techniques on pixel-based visualizations brings out the best of the recursive data patterns and further enhances the effectiveness of the visualization techniques. The result is a fast and versatile analysis tool to reveal hidden structures that might lead to the discoveries of functional identifications as well as phenotypic changes of whole genomes. The technology has been demonstrated with nine different whole bacterial genomes obtained from public genome banks.  The simplicity and effectiveness of the design of the technology is demonstrated by its ability to process and compare two Neisseria meningitides strains in a matter of seconds on a modest SUN Ultra 10 workstation with 256M of memory.  Although the design of the new visualization technique is targeted at analyzing genomic sequences, it can be used to study other types of sequential datasets with a-priori orders.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 60 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

This Pre-solicitation notice announces that RSPA intends to release a solicitation (Request for Proposals (RFP)) for this requirement.  The National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) was designed to establish a workable program of tabletop and area exercises to further the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) that relate to spill response preparedness, while economically feasible for the government and the oil industry.  Contractor support is required for (1) up to twenty tabletop exercises (strategic exercises that focus on operator's spill management team and their approach to implementing their Facility Response Plan (FRP));  (2) up to four area exercises  (exercises that test the response by government, industry, and community players as detailed in the local Area Contingency Plan (ACP)); and (3) approximately five policy papers/reports (these papers/reports will identify courses of action to expedite the return to service of damaged pipelines).  It is anticipated that this requirement will be awarded as a three-year (base plus two option periods) cost plus award fee type contract.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541690 and the small business size standard is $6 million.  A copy of the solicitation will be available electronically in approximately 15 days after this posting, website: http://www.rspa.dot.gov, under Procurement Opportunities.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be made available.  This requirement is 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Propulsive Small Expendable Deployer System (ProSEDS) Differential Ion Flux Probe w/Mass Analysis (DIFPM) Support.  This work includes analysis and inputs from the DIFPM calibration and test data, the data from the ProSEDS mission results, the ionospheric model predictions and results obtained from the Langmuir Probe instruments on ProSEDS.  Development and validation of any required software to analyze the data from the DIFPM must be accomplished as part of this task.  Support of launch preparations including mission simulations and data flow is required.    NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from SRS Technologies, Inc. pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: (a) SRS Technologies has a select team of key personnel with unique capabilities to support the analysis of data from the DIFPM for ProSEDS. Specifically, SRS Technologies has extensive experience in the analysis of space flight data from plasma diagnostic instruments including instruments on many previous missions.  The contractor’s unique capabilities and experience cannot be obtained from any other source.  (b) SRS Technologies has the computational code developed to calculate the electrodynamic thrust generated by electrodynamic tethers.  The application of this code to the results of the ProSEDS experiment will save the government money by taking advantage of the existing code and expertise at SRS.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on May 2, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

This contract may be used on a non-mandatory basis by federal government activities (including the VA, Air Force, Army, Navy) as a source for the services and supplies described herein.  Federal government activities in both CONUS and overseas may place orders against this contract.  Because the majority of contract task order requirements will fall under a $100,000 threshold, and in the interests of providing increased opportunities for small business concerns, competition for contract award will be limited to qualified HUBZone contractors.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notification of a new requirement, replacing the previous draft solicitation MS-01-R-0004 in its entirety, of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) to lease, on a long term basis (10 years), a quantity of six large transport jet aircraft with a minimum passenger capacity of 148.  New or used aircraft are acceptable.  It is estimated that each aircraft will be flown approximately 1400 hours per year.  Aircraft will be leased with the contractor to provide all maintenance, but without crews since the USMS will fly their missions with properly certified USMS pilots/crews.  The aircraft will generally depart from and return to USMS sites with flights being both inside and outside of the Continental United States.  A multi-year contracting approach, a multiple year contract approach, and a combination multi-year/multiple year approach will be available for offerors to select from in developing their proposals.  Contractors will be required to propose a full quantity of six aircraft.  For the purpose of standardizing the USMS Fleet, all aircraft will need to be of the same model with the same primary avionics, instrument displays, and engines.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The primary purpose of the study is to understand how the availability of private long-term care insurance benefits affects the decisions made by claimants and their family caregivers to access various types of long-term care services both initially; i.e., when the policyholder enters into claim status, and over a subsequent 18 month period.  The Contractor must: create an industry-wide, longitudinal database on an admission cohort of private long-term care insurance claimants which includes claims data, person-level data, and insurance policy design data (e.g. reimbursement, indemnity, and disability).  A major requirement of this acquisition is that the contractor possesses considerable background in research on private long-term care insurance so that the study can be completed in time to provide information relevant to government policymaking.  LifePlans, Inc. alone has both the research experience and pre-established relationships and track record of doing research with a significant majority of long-term care insurance companies that allows for specific and timely analyses to be performed.  Furthermore, LifePlans, Inc. is in receipt of grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in the amount of approximately $500,00 to fund roughly one half the cost of this study.  Any other contractor would have to; 1) have existing relationships with long term care insurers, 2) have the data system capabilities for this nationwide study, 3) acquire specialized knowledge of the survey instruments, sample design and nurse assessment capability relating to private long-term care insurance, and, 4) provide a source of funds for half the cost of the study in order to perform the analyses required in the scope of work.  Therefore, the government believes that to award this contract to any contractor but LifePlans would result in a significant increase in cost and even then would not assure adequate representation among participating insurance companies.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government=s requirement as described above including a specific statement addressing the fourth factor listed above (source of additional funding).  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to the contact point and address given above.

BACKGROUND: The National Center for Environmental Research (NCER) of the Office of Research and Development (ORD) has a need for the preparation of a  State of the Science Report on Bioengineering for Pollution Prevention.  Since 1995, NCER in partnership with the National Science Foundation (NSF) has sponsored a program of research grants on this topic.  The two agencies have supported more than 150 grants for periods of three years, with the  most recent grants scheduled to terminate in 2005.  A significant amount of work is also occurring in other university and government laboratories. Recently, there has been considerable interest in bioengineering for pollution prevention.  For example, engineering of enzymatic processes, using  biomass as a feedstock, and biocatalysis offer technologies that eliminate pollution at its source and reduce energy consumption.  A considerable body of research and an intellectual infrastructure has been focused on this topic.  The time is right for a state-of-the-science report which summarizes  and critically reviews what we know about bioengineering for pollution prevention. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this requirement is to obtain contractor assistance in summarizing information currently available on the subject and present it in the form of a draft report and full report.  The  principal audiences for the paper are the EPA Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances, the Office of Air, the Office of Water, Office of Solid Waste, and the Office of Research and Development.  NCER may also use the paper to consider future research initiatives in this and related  subjects.  A secondary audience will be the community of scientists and engineers who work in this research area, including those in both academia and industry.  SCOPE OF WORK: The contractor shall prepare a paper on the State of Science of Bioengineering for Pollution Prevention.  The preparer  shall isolate the important timely conference information and key studies in the field which inform the question implied by the title of  the paper and critically assess them with respect to the status of bioengineering processes in industry and further research needs.  The final paper should be  30-50 pages in length, excluding references and appendices.  The format of the paper shall follow the format of an established peer-reviewed journal in the field, to be selected by the contractor. The overall goals of the paper are to: (1) Assess the extent to which existing research supports  realistic applications of bioengineering. (2) Identify knowledge gaps where additional research?fundamental or applied?is needed to support realistic applications.  (3) Evaluate the impact of grants funded under the joint EPA/NSF program, Technology for a Sustainable Environment (TSE), on the  state of science. To achieve these goals, the paper shall: 	(1) Discuss the important key elements of the current literature, which will include:  (A)	an assessment of the current state of knowledge with respect to the fundamental aspects of the chemistry and engineering problems involved in  bioengineering with particular emphasis on research done under the TSE program. (B)	examples of successful applications that result in environmentally friendly processes (considering the life cycle of the process). (C) 	significant and feasible future developments by synthesizing the most recent  conference results, and providing a summary of how the current research under TSE fits into the state of science for environmentally benign bioengineering applications. (2) Recommend areas where future research is needed, in particular, identify   significant and feasible future developments. (3)  Sources of information for the paper shall include the following: 		(A)	Published papers from the grantees in the TSE program, annual  			progress reports from the grantees, and other information obtained by NCER or NSF from the grantees; 		(B)	Patent literature. 		(C)	Peer reviewed literature  publications from other experts in the field. 		(D)	Pertinent conference proceedings. 		NOTE: The NCER Project Officer shall supply materials from its grantees.  Other materials shall be obtained by the contractor.  It should be noted that the report is intended to be a critical state of the  science paper, not an encyclopedic review.  PEER REVIEW: The draft paper will be subjected to an internal and external peer review upon submission.

Payment will be made by a combination of contingency fees and firm, fixed prices.  Law firms or solo practitioners who respond to this solicitation MUST be regularly engaged in the private practice of LAW within the federal Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

The government anticipates awarding up to three contracts (or more or less at the discretion of the government).  The period of performance for each contract will be one base year plus up to six optional years.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke, Laboratory of Functional and Molecular Imaging (LFMI), proposes to enter into a sole source contract with Resonance Research Inc., 10 Cook Street, Billerica, MA 01821, for a Shim Set and Shim Power Supply for an 11.7T MRI System.  The Laboratory of Functional and Molecular Imaging is dedicated to developing ultra-high field MRI techniques for assessing brain function in vivo.  The LFMI has a state-of-the-art, one of two-of-a-kind, 11.7T horizontal MRI spectrometer for performing brain imaging of rodents at very-high spatial and temporal resolution.  The key factor in LFMI's research is spatial resolution of acquired images, which depends on two factors: 1) the magnetic field strength, and 2) the magnetic field homogeneity.  The magnetic field strength dictates the available signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) of MR images.  When samples are inserted in the magnet bore, severe local field distortions occur due to the different magnetic properties of different tissues. These field distortions, if left uncorrected, render the MR images useless.  The LFMI requires a 6 channel shim set and associated 6 channel shim power supply to equip the 11.7T MRI System. The shim set requires the following features: 1) Inner diameter 150 mm, outer diameter 200 mm; 2) 5 second order coils (Z2, ZX, ZY, C2, S2) and one third order coil, Z3; 3) minimum of 2500 Hz/cm2 shim capability on each second order coil, and 1000 Hz/cm3 on the Z3 coil. The 6-Channel Power Supply requires the following features: 1) capable of producing 10 A per channel and 2kW dc output in a six-channel configuration, 2) full power bandwidth of 35 kHz; 3) 90 V maximum voltage compliance.  Resonance Research Inc., is the only source known to the Government that can provide the above items with the required features.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the Governments requirements herein. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than 2:00 PM EST on April 24, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.3102-1.  The requirement will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See numbered note #1.  Total small business set-aside. NAICS Code 334510, business size standard 500. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intend to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with Smarteam Communications Inc., 1612 U Street, N.W., Washington D.C. 20009, to develop marketing materials and to conduct a review of the web site for National Institute Health Library.   Through competitive procedures  Smarteam Inc., was issued a purchase order to develop marketing materials and web site design for the NIH Library.  Smarteam Inc., successfully created the logo and slogan for the NIH Library.  At this time, it is required that the logo and slogan designed by Smarteam, Inc., is applied to the NIH Library?s publications and web site applications.  In order to maintain continuity of the methodologies used for the design of NIH Library?s publication and web site, and due to the knowledge gained by Smarteam Inc., in the initial competitive acquisition, an award to any other source for this follow-on contract would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.   Background Information:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is one of the largest medical research centers in the world with a staff of more than 18,000 of whom 6,000 are specialists and/or physicians.  The Library serves as a focal point for the exchange of biomedical information vital to the support of research activities conducted in the laboratories and clinics at the National Institutes of Health located in and around Bethesda, Maryland.  Areas of research include medicine, biology, physics, veterinary medicine, chemistry, and statistics.  The Library also serves the information needs of the administrative staff.

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), National Emergency Training Center (NETC), Emergency Management Institute (EMI) has an Emergency Management Higher Education project/requirement for development of a college-level course entitled ?Holistic Disaster Recovery:  Creating A More Sustainable Future.?  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The associated NAICS code is 611430,Professional Development Training, and the small business size standard is $6.0 million [average annual receipts for three preceding fiscal years].  The goal of this requirement is to encourage and support the expansion of hazard, disaster and emergency management related education in colleges and universities across the United States so that in the future more emergency management and related personnel in government and in the private sector will come to the job not only with a college education, but with a course of study in emergency management as well.  This will help to contribute to the professionalism of emergency management and the expansion of emergency management knowledge and principles into other professions and disciplines as well, all of which contributes to building disaster-resistant and resilient communities of tomorrow.  Toward that end, EMI, located at the NETC in Emmitsburg, Maryland, developed the Higher Education Project, the primary purpose of which is to encourage and support the development of hazard, disaster and emergency management bachelor and graduate degree programs within United States colleges and universities.

Each Emergency Management Higher Education Project course shall be developed within the philosophical context of (1) building disaster resistant and resilient communities, and (2) seeking balance between the technocratic and the social vulnerability reduction approaches to emergency management.  Please refer to the Higher Education Project Slide Presentation at the following website address: http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/hihgedbrief/course2.ppt
Course developers shall be college/university faculty with doctoral credentials and upper division college-level teaching experience, as well as emergency management and/or disaster field research experience.  Emphasis shall be placed on the practical application of knowledge gained by federal and state agencies and organizations responsible for assisting local governments with recovery and the actions taken at the local level following disasters.  

Among the most important lessons to be conveyed in the course is the need to recognize the social, political and institutional systems in which disasters occur and the inherent design strengths and flaws that can both help or hinder the recovery process.  The majority of discussion shall center on the impacts of disasters on political systems and organizational interrelationships, including how specific factors guide redevelopment, the implementation of mitigation measures post-disaster, economic recovery, community well-being, social justice, community empowerment and the development of institutional capacity.  The course shall incorporate an evaluation of the level of inter-organizational coordination across state and local governments in order to identify whether federal, state and local programs compliment or conflict with the broad objectives of mitigation and sustainable redevelopment.  The purpose of this requirement is to develop a 45-48 hour contact hour classroom-based course on ?Disaster Recovery Planning: Creating A More Sustainable Future.?  The final product shall be a complete and ready-to-use course, which could be taught, ?as is? at 4-year accredited colleges and universities at the junior to senior level.  The course shall be developed so as to enhance student understanding of emergency management principles and applications relevant to disaster recovery planning, and shall be developed within the philosophical context of ?Building Disaster Resistant and Resilient Communities,? which places priority emphasis on prevention, mitigation and vulnerability reduction.  The course shall also be developed within the context of seeking balance between the two bi-polar approaches to United States emergency management:  the dominant ?technocratic? approach and the more recent ?social vulnerability? approach.  The course shall fulfill the requirements of a standard 3-semester hour college course at the junior to senior level and be developed so that it could be taught within an emergency management major or certificate program to students who may someday enter an emergency management-related profession.  Since all deliverables shall be provided in hard-copy and in electronic format for distribution via the Internet, all deliverables shall be Section 508 compliant.

Award of a firm-fixed-price purchase order is anticipated.  The award will be made based on ?Best Value? to the Government, in accordance with the evaluation factors set forth in the Request for Quotation package.  Quotes will be due 30 days from the release date of the Request for Quotation.  See numbered note #1.  

Potential offerors must request the Request for Quotation package in writing to: Teresa Dingle, Contract Specialist, FEMA Flood, Fire and Mitigation Branch, E114B, 16825 S. Seton Avenue, Emmitsburg, Maryland 21727 OR teresa.dingle@fema.gov.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate with Rolls Royce Corporation, 2001 South Tibbs Avenue, Indianapolis, IN 46206-0420 on an other than full and open competitive basis to restructure and extend contract N00019-95-C-0209 three years in order to accommodate performance impacts resulting from the V-22 Program's reduced production quantities and suspension of flight operations.  The proposed extension does not provide for new work above or beyond what was originally contracted for; its purpose is to provide additional time to fulfill the original contract's requirements.  The extended period of performance includes FY04 through FY06 AE1107C engine production and related intermediate and depot level engine repair and spare parts support under Rolls Royce's commercial Power by the Hour (PBTH) maintenance arrangement.  The prospective restructure/extension contract modification slows and re-allocates engine production of approximately 165 AE1107C engines over FYs 03-06, thereby extending the original commercial contract and the concurrent PBTH commercial maintenance agreement for three additional years.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Rolls Royce Corporation is the designer, developer and sole producer of the AE1107C engine. NOTE 22 Applicable to this synopsis (Sole Source)

This system shall include a sensor to automatically restart the system should modelocked operation be interrupted;** (l) The laser shall have an internal diagnostic system which includes:  (1) an autoranging five decade fluorescence detector/power meter to facilitate alignment and optimization, (2) a monitor to verify CW spectral content to insure spectral integrity of output and maintain pure modelocked operation, and (3) a biased, fast photodiode to provide a synchronization signal for detector triggering;** (m) The laser shall have a thermally-compensated resonator so that the system automatically and passively offsets the effects of thermal fluctuations in the laboratory that cause drift over long periods of operation;** (n) The system shall have internal pump laser steering optics for maximum control of the pump beam position into the Ti:Sapphire crystal.  These mounts shall provide independent translational and rotational positioning of the Ar pump beam;** (o) The system shall be able to be pumped from the side of the laser so that no turning mirror is required outside the laser itself to direct the Ar beam into the cavity.  This configuration also allows the laser to be positioned at the corner of an optical table for optimum control and conservation of space;** (p) The laser shall include a separate CW cavity arm to facilitate alignment.  This arm may also be used to produce tunable CW output from the laser;** (q) An on-site warranty of one year/5000 hours, whichever expires first, beginning at the time of installation, shall be included, and shall cover parts and labor;** (r) Vendor installation at NIST shall be included;*****II.

<DESC>PURPOSE OF ANNOUNCEMENT:  The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Maintenance, Inspection, and Repair Section at the William J. Hughes Technical Center has a requirement for the following scope of work: <P> Effects of Related and Unrelated Maintenance on the Integrity of Aircraft Electrical Interconnect Systems <P> Background:  Maintenance actions are specified to preserve the integrity of aircraft structural and nonstructural systems, but such maintenance actions also have the potential to inadvertently damage or degrade these systems or collocated systems.  The objective of this task is to identify both the positive and negative consequences of maintenance action on large transport aircraft electrical interconnect systems.   Two approaches will be taken to assessing maintenance effects.  An empirical assessment of aged aircraft will attempt to determine EIS degradation associated with improper maintenance.  Teams of inspectors will identify improperly installed or maintained electrical interconnect components or improperly installed or maintained systems that may have had a collateral effect on the EIS.  The assessment will follow a rigorous protocol and will address both high and low maintenance areas to identify differences in EIS condition attributable to maintenance.  Aircraft mo! difications (with or without a Supplemental Type Certificate) will be inspected and identify improper installation and subsequent maintenance effects. A parallel effort will examine the effects of both proper and improper maintenance by simulating the effects of maintenance on wire.  This effort will involve exposing EIS components to contaminants and wear resulting from maintenance actions.  Wire degradation and flammability effects of compounds improperly applied directly or indirectly to EIS components shall be evaluated.  Compounds include materials such as those used for cleaning, corrosion protection, lubricants, paints, etc.  Effects from the accumulation of other maintenance related debris (such as drill shavings) will also be evaluated.  In all cases, consideration will be given to operationally related accumulation of lint, dust, and dirt and the potential effect of these accumulations when combined with the contaminants and debris described above. Specific Work It! ems: 1.	The contractor shall develop a specific work plan following the general approach stated above.  The plan will include a.	For the Aged Aircraft Assessment i.	A description of the constitution of the inspection teams. ii.	A draft protocol for inspecting aged transport aircraft iii.	A description of how data will be categorized and validated iv.	A description of how the data will be analyzed b.	For the Simulation of Aircraft Maintenance i.	A review of manufacturer's specified inspection and maintenance practices including aging aircraft programs (supplemental inspection programs). ii.	A comprehensive list of materials (solids, fluids, gases) used in aircraft maintenance activities including an assessment of the potential effects of these materials on the EIS system. iii.	A description of the impact of identified inspection maintenance activities on the EIS.  iv.	A description of the methods that will be used to simulate the above effects of inspection and maintenance. v! .	A description of the data analysis to be used. 2.	The contractor shall review the draft plan with the Technical Monitor (AAR 433) and Research Sponsor (AFS 300) and make any necessary changes. 3.	The contractor shall execute the mutually agreed upon work plan. 4.	The contractor shall hold an interim and final review of the effort Deliverables:  ·	A draft work plan ·	A final work plan ·	Two interim letter reports on the task progress ·	A final report Period of Performance: The estimated period of performance is 12 months from contract award. <P> A Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract is contemplated.  The Government intends to issue the solicitation electronically.  Prospective offerors shall request solicitation no. DTFA0302R00017 no later than April 30, 2002 to the attention of Jeanine Passetti, Contract Specialist, at Jeanine.Passetti@tc.faa.gov.  Offerors are required to provide a point of contact, mailing address, phone number, fax number, and email address of their company.  NOTE: Incomplete or inaccurate information provided by an offeror may result in a company being not notified of critical information or due dates.

<RESPDATE>042602
<CONTACT>Dixie Harper, (202) 493-5940
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking potential sources for Regional Telecommunications Support (RTS).  RTS will be a set aside for Small Business Administration (SBA) certified socially and economically disadvantaged firms,8(a)  The FAA is planning to procure RTS on a Government Wide Agency Contract (GWAC).  <P> The expected contract value is approximately $10 million per year. <P> The purpose of this work is to assist the FAA in the planning; installation, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of FAA owned and leased telecommunication networks, as well as certain DOD telecommunications activities.

This Amendment (1) is to provide clarification to various sections of the SIR package.  The attached file (Amend1.zip) contains the following changed pages to the SIR/RFO package: Section B: Pages B-1, B-2 and B-3 Section C: Pages C-4, C-12a (added) and C-18 Section E :  Page E-2 Section F:  Pages F-2, F-3 and F-15 Section G:  Page G-3 Section H:  Pages H-1 and H-5 Section J-1 Product Description: Pages i,  6, 11, 26, 29, 30 and 40 Section J-4 Appendices to OCT Plan :  Pages A-2, A-12, A-39 and B3-4 Contact Point: Should you have any questions concerning this SIR/RFO announcement, please contact Mr. Larry Greer, Contracting Officer, at 202-493-4810 or by email (larry.greer@faa.gov).  <P> Original Announcement: <P> This announcement is for SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR)/REQUEST FOR OFFER (RFO) DTFA01-02-R-0202109.  The Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking and accepting proposals for new ground–based Air/Ground Ultrahigh Frequency (UHF) Radio receivers and transmitters.  These radios will replace aging equipment in the en route environment of the National Airspace System (NAS).  The contract will cover a base period of five years, followed by five one-year options. <P> All interested parties are advised that the FAA will NOT pay for any information or any costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this SIR/RFO announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with SIR/RFO submissions will be solely at the interested party’s expense.   <P> Background:    <P> These new radios will be operated with the same 25 kilohertz, double sideband, amplitude modulated waveform as the existing equipment, but use later technology components and are intended to have some additional capabilities, such as remote monitoring and a high power transmitter that will eliminate the need for separate linear power amplifiers necessary for some applications.  The package includes a request for a ten-year warranty and a list of data requirements , as well as technical and logistics support options. <P> As a result of comments received from potential offerors in response to the November 21, 2001 Request for Information (RFI) and other sources, the UHF Radio Product Description (FAA-P-2956) has been modified significantly.  In general, the mandatory requirements (shalls) have been reduced or relaxed and a number of desired features (shoulds) have been added, particularly in the area of remote monitoring and co-site parameters.  A copy of the received comments and the corresponding resolutions is attached (1221finl.xls).  <P> Instructions for Industry <P> Interested parties are encouraged to review all attachments.  Only written comments will be considered.  All submissions/responses will be properly secured and protected by the FAA.  All proprietary information must be so marked.  Please be advised that all submissions become government property.  All submissions must be in writing and in English. <P> Part of the source selection process will be an Operational Capabilities Test  (OCT) conducted at the William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) to evaluate each offeror’s candidate equipment.  Consequently, Section L, Instructions to Offerors, limits the Technical Equipment Proposal to those requirements that will not be addressed by the OCT.   <P> In addition to the written proposal, offerors are requested to submit a self-evaluation of their equipment’s capability to meet all requirements of the Purchase Description.  (See Section L.8.2.2).   Offerors assume the full responsibility for ensuring that “Submissions for OCT” is received No Later Than 3:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time on July 1, 2002. <P> The “Submission for OCT” shall be mailed, hand-carried, delivered by courier, or overnight delivery to the CO representative at the William J.

<DESC>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110 (A-110) provides public access under some circumstances to research data through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  A-110 applies to new and competing continuation awards made after April 17, 2000, and applies to data that are (1) first produced in a project that is supported in whole or in part with Federal funds; and (2) cited publicly and officially by a Federal agency in support of an action that has the force and effect of law, i.e., regulations and administrative orders.

Requests made under OMB Circular A-110 differ from traditional requests made under the FOIA, because A-110 allows the public to request data collected by institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit institutions that receive grants and other financial assistance provided by Federal agencies.  Such requests will still be made through the traditional FOIA channels.  However, most FOIA offices lack the scientific and technical expertise that is necessary to review the responsive data set and ensure that it has been redacted in accordance with A-110 and the FOIA.

The Contractor will primarily act as a liaison between the NIH FOIA Office and the NIH Grantee Institution in generating a redacted data set that is responsive to an A-110 request, and in handling fees associated with processing a request.  Once the FOIA Office receives a request, it will be forwarded to the Contractor for processing.  The Contractor will be responsible for contacting the Grantee Institution and obtaining a redacted copy of the responsive data set from the Grantee Institution.  The Grantee Institution will provide, along with the redacted data set, a written justification, detailing what information was redacted and why.  The Contractor will review the redacted data set for responsiveness, and to ensure that all personal identifiers and proprietary information were removed.  If necessary, the Contractor will travel to the Grantee Institution to perform this review, and will negotiate with the Grantee Institution to generate a redacted data set that is releasable under A-110 and the FOIA.

Further, the Contractor will be responsible for the collection and accounting of fees associated with processing a request.  The Contractor will obtain a cost estimate, to provide a redacted data set, from the Grantee Institution and will generate its own cost estimate.  The Contractor will receive a prepayment from the requestor, and will hold the monies in a non-interest-bearing account while the request is processed.  Once processing is complete but prior to the release of the redacted data, the Contractor shall collect any amount due or refund any amount owed to the requestor.  The Contractor shall also reimburse the Grantee Institution out of the fees held in the non-interest bearing account.  Any monies still remaining (after the Grantee Institution is reimbursed) shall be used to defray the costs, first to the Contractor and then to the NIH A-110 Service Center. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 514199 with a size standard of $6,000,000.

<DESC>POINT OF CONTACT IS MR. KAM AGI, 202-267-1872, E-MAIL:  kagi@comdt.uscg.mil.  

The Coast Guard seeks additions to the existing Qualified Products List (QPL) for Solar Photovoltaic Arrays for 12-Volt DC Marine Aids to Navigation conforming to Civil Engineering specification no. 401B.  Procedures for qualifying are detailed in specification  401B.  Products on the QPL need not be requalified.  Solar Photovoltaic Arrays charge lead-acid batteries during daylight hours; which, in turn, power light and sound signals on marine aids to navigation at night.  Solar Photovoltaic Arrays are used on buoys and at lighthouses and are exposed to a harsh marine environment.  Copies of the specification are available from the Specification Preparing Activity (SPA), Commandant (G-SEC-2A/6114), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20593-0001 at telephone number 202-267-1872 or by telefax at 202-267-4788 or e-mail at:  Kagi@comdt.uscg.mil.  Manufacturers desiring qualification should advise the SPA in writing of their intent to qualify.  Responsibility for testing is divided between the Government and manufacturer as detailed in specification 401B.  Manufacturers with test samples submitted by 31 August 2002 will be qualified as a group.  Successful manufacturers in this group may be placed on the QPL by 31 December 2002.  Manufacturers not meeting the 31 August 2002 deadline will be placed on the QPL upon successful completion of the tests.  However, the government furnished portion of testing, for manufacturers not meeting the 31 August 2002 deadline, will be performed on a Not-to-interfere basis, which may require indefinite delay.  Consideration in all future contracts will be given only to those products accepted for inclusion on the QPL.
Interested companies are encouraged to request copies of Specification no. 401B via e-mail to:  Kagi@comdt.uscg.mil..
 E-mail submission may include files in Microsoft Word format.   Notices of intent to respond shall be in writing to: Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters (G-SEC-2A/6114), 2100 Second Street S.W. Washington, D.C.  20593-0001.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES TO IDENTIFY SOURCES AND OTHER MARKET INFORMATION.  This notice does not constitute and Invitation For Bid or Request For Proposal and is not to be construed as an offer or a quote.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resulting solicitation!!!!

<SUBJECT>S -- Privatization of Electrical Distribution System at Ft. Detrick, MD Synopsis
<SOLNBR>SP0600-02-R-0048
<RESPDATE>050102
<ARCHDATE>05162002
<CONTACT>Terri Workman, Contract Specialist, Phone 703 767-8453, Fax 703 767-8757, Email tworkman@desc.dla.mil
<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center, in conjunction with the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), Headquarters US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), and Fort Detrick, seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to possible privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, "Utility Systems: Convenyance Authority" for Utility Privatization of the Electrical Distribution System at Fort Detrick, Maryland.  The potential privatization action will include transfer of ownership, operation and maintenance, and the obligation to serve.  The Army will not transfer ownership of land or any land sease interest for Fort Detrick and will grant easements and leases, with concurrence of the underlying leaseholder where applicable, for access to land associated with each utility system.  OBJECTIVE:  Should privatization occur, the ownership of the entire electrical distribution system and equipment to include, all capital investments, operation, maintenance and repair responsibilities, shall transfer to a publicly or privately owned utility provider.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, major systems renovation, construction, equipment, manpower and overhead shall be the responsibility of the new owner.  Utility services under the potential contract will not include electrical supply.  Therefore the owner of the distribution network and equipment need not also generate of resell electric power to Fort Detrick.  INSTALLATION AND UTILITY SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:  Fort Detrick is a federal reservation completely surrounded by the City of Frederick, and Frederick County, Maryland.  Its primary mission is to support biomedical research and development, military medical logistics and global telecommunications.  It serves four cabinet-level agencies; the Departments of Defense, Treasury, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services. Within the Department of Defense, Fort Detrick supports elements of all of the Services.  Major Army tenants include the Medical Research and Materiel Command, the Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, the Medical Materiel Agency, and the 1108th Signal Battalion.   Fort Detrick is comprised of 1,212 acres and contains 425 buildings; 354 permanent, 41 semi-permanent and 30 temporary.  The total building square footage is 3,228,584.

Allegheny Power provides power to Fort Detrick.  From April 99 to March 00, electric consumption was 137,034,300 kilowatt-hours (kWh) with a peak demand of 27,446 kW (in July).  Power enters the Post and is metered at three sites. Two of these 34.5 kV metering sites are in Area A: one in the Allegheny Power metering substation for the incoming feed on the eastern edge of the Fort boundary and the other on the Allegheny Power pole for the incoming feed on the western edge of the Fort boundary.  Power is distributed throughout the installation at 4.16 kV via seven distribution substations.  These substations range in size from 5,000 to 15,000 kVA.  The electrical distribution system consists of approximately 28.2 circuit-miles of overhead and 2.1 circuit-miles of underground primary distribution lines.  The system includes approximately 340 pad and pole-mounted transformers and approximately 280 primary electric meters.  Additionally, the system includes 100 poles rated for 34.5 kV, 668 poles rated for 4.16 kV, and 200 poles for secondary service.  The third metering site services the Water and Sewage Stations, that are located beyond the boundaries of the Fort in the City of Fredrick, Maryland.  This 12.47 kV metering site and the Government-owned facilities serviced by it (the Water and Sewage Stations) are excluded from the scope of this privatization contract.  Post personnel indicate the capacity of the current system is adequate for present and future needs.

<SUBJECT>14 -- Supersonic Cruise Missile, Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration
<SOLNBR>TBD
<RESPDATE>053102
<ARCHDATE>06152002
<CONTACT>Barbara Roberson, Procurement Analyst, Phone 703-767-5765, Fax 703-767-4441, Email barbara.roberson@dtra.mil - Barbara Roberson, Procurement Analyst, Phone 703-767-5765, Fax 703-767-4441, Email barbara.roberson@dtra.mil
<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is soliciting information from missile system integrators and other interested parties on technology available for a transformational approach to providing an affordable Supersonic Cruise Missile (SSCM) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD).  The SSCM ACTD will culminate in a technology demonstration of a supersonic cruise missile system capable of functionally disabling time sensitive Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) targets, hardened and deeply buried WMD targets, or both.  Time sensitive WMD targets are broadly classified as those posing imminent threat of conducting or supporting hostile attack (or re-attack) on U.S. or allied forces or civilian population centers.

Government sponsorship of the SSCM ACTD includes DTRA, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV), with additional international participation.  The objective of this RFI is to identify technological concepts and performance potential for the SSCM ACTD, which may also be used as the basis for developing the SSCM ACTD performance specification.  This specification may subsequently be provided to industry as part of the anticipated SSCM ACTD solicitation.

The SSCM ACTD will operationally demonstrate an integrated system concept - including targeting, launch control, flight vehicle, payload (warhead and fuzing), and damage assessment - using mature and evolving technologies.  Technologies of particular importance for the SSCM ACTD include but are not limited to: (a) the integrated airframe and propulsion system; (b) potential payloads for time-sensitive surface targets; (c) a potential penetrator warhead; (d) low-cost smart-fuzing options; (e) autonomous guidance, navigation, and control technologies; and (f) battle damage indication / assessment to provide positive, real-time or near real time feedback using anticipated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance resources (C4ISR).

Key performance parameters for the SSCM ACTD include but are not limited to:  (a) terminal accuracy of 3 meters Circular Error Probable (CEP) or better, excluding Target Location Error (good weather, no jamming); (b) a range of at least 400 nautical miles with a goal of at least 600 nautical miles; (c) a cruising speed of at least Mach 3.5 with a goal of Mach 4.5 or better; (d) for any air-launched demonstration variant, a maximum all-up-round launch weight of less than 2000 lbs. with a goal of 1800 lbs.; (e) warhead penetration capability of at least 10 meters with a goal of 15 meters or better through 5 ksi concrete; (f) soft target kill capability and bio-defeat fill compatibility; and (g) a strike planning, preparation, and launch duration, from receipt of target coordinates for mission planning to physical weapon release/exit from the launch platform, of less than 6 minutes.

Important design considerations for the SSCM ACTD and any follow-on program include but are not limited to:  (a) potential production affordability (assuming a production run of 200 missiles per year for five contiguous years, starting in FY07), yielding a weapon that is more cost effective than currently produced systems; (b) design flexibility and/or use of a common missile body with unique launch kits and/or boosters that allows for a launch capability from surface combatants (using existing MK 41 VLS), aircraft (F/A-18E/F strike aircraft ; USN P-3; and potentially USAF bomber platforms, including B-1B internal and B-52 external carriage), and potentially sub-surface combatants (VLS); (c) survivability, including GPS jamming resistance; (d) all-weather operation; (e) fire-and-forget operation; (f) Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) approach for in-flight retargeting; (g) low life cycle cost and ease of maintenance; (h) concept of operations (CONOPS); (i) payload modularity - that is, missile compatibility with alternate warhead concepts; (j) manufacturability and P3I considerations for a potential System Development and Demonstration (SDD)/Production phase; (k) post-ACTD residual deployment compatibility with anticipated strike planning systems; and (l) ability to pass a shipboard Weapon System Explosive Safety Review Board (WSESRB) and aircraft safety review and to be compliant with standard range safety flight test program requirements.  The SSCM ACTD system shall be SALT II, START, and Missile Technology Control Regime (MCTR) compliant.

An addendum on the trade space of speed, range, weight, and payload versus cost is desired that encompasses operating characteristics beyond both lower and upper ends of desired performance.  Potentially reduced performance versions of interest would be desirable to meet the following needs:  (a) for surface combatants, to support enhanced Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS) volumes of fire support requirements with multiple weapons/payloads in a single MK 41 VLS canister; (b) for air, to support an optimum carrier strike wing package with a missile range of at least 300 nautical miles that meets the F/A-18E/F weapons carriage requirements and permits carrier recovery of the F/A-18E/F with two weapons aboard; and (c) for sub-surface combatants, to support VLS and Torpedo Tube Launch.

Respondents to this RFI may choose to suggest missile payloads that address either the penetration mission, the time-sensitive surface attack mission, or both.  The U.S. Government is seeking transformational approaches in program management and technology integration which will be required to provide an affordable solution to this composite problem.  Respondents are free to address the problem of targets that may relocate after attack coordinates are derived for them but are stationary during missile terminal attack, and targets that may be moving during missile terminal attack, but these attack modes are not required of the ACTD system and may be addressed in terms of a P3I approach.  Respondents should be able to reasonably justify threat and target characteristics utilized.

This RFI solicits the identification of appropriate technologies and technical capabilities for the development of the ACTD program plan.  Maturity and risk level of the supporting technologies should be addressed.  Additionally, RFI respondents should provide Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimates to complete the ACTD program, based on the following assumptions:  (1) ACTD go-ahead in January 2004, with demonstrations complete by the end of CY07; (2) any Contractor team would provide for: (a) ACTD systems engineering, systems integration, project management, (b) conduct of two system demonstration flights - at least one surface-launched (US Navy VLS system mock-up on land test range) and potentially one air-launched (US Navy aircraft) flight - with each demonstration including transition to cruise, terminal guidance and impact with required CEP, (c) fabrication of test missiles as well as ten residual operational assets and associated operational and support equipment (including mission planning components), (d) verification of actual test performance against objectives and validation of test goals and modeling and simulations, (e) other ancillary tests or modeling and simulation adequate to ensure the ACTD system meets performance requirements, (f) appropriate level of documentation deliverables, and (g) any other tests that the contractor recommends for a successful ACTD; and (3) target preparation and flight test range costs would be borne by the Government. 

RFI responses shall be limited to no more than forty (40) pages plus no more than a four (4) page addendum, not including cover letter, cover page, and table of contents.  If the material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  The response should include, but is not limited to, the following:  (a) system concept(s) and associated performance (including range-altitude-Mach profiles), cost, and risk parameters; (b) recommended ACTD approach and ROM estimate with respondent's stated assumptions for the baseline 4 year ACTD (an ACTD of less than 48 months in duration is of interest to the Government; respondents may submit an additional ROM for a shorter ACTD); (c) technology maturity and Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), with rationale, for the major system subcomponents, such as the propulsion system, guidance system, payload, etc.; (d) a discussion of the military utility of the proposed system concept; and (e) any other technical information respondents deem necessary to aid the government in making an informed assessment.  Cost information (ACTD ROM costs, potential production unit cost, etc.) provided should include basis of estimate substantiation.  Teaming is encouraged.  It is the Government's intention to review the data and possibly schedule a briefing with some of the respondents to gain further insight.  Those respondents will be contacted individually.  Responses shall be submitted no later than 4pm EDT on 31 May 2002 to Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Supersonic Cruise Missile ACTD RFI, Attn: Noel Vivaldi, ALT (703) 325-1198), 6801 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22310.

<DESC>The following announcement has been placed in FedBizOpps on behalf of the OECD.  Do not repeat do not contact the Department of State regarding this announcement. The Organization for Economic Development (OECD) is issuing an international call for candidates for a design competition for the redevelopment of the OECD headquarters in Paris, la Muette.  Interested companies and/or partnerships may submit offers to the OECD directly, within the deadlines and under the conditions set in the call for candidates (see internet website address below).  The OECD in Paris has decided to redevelop its La Muette site which comprises a number of buildings, some of which present major health (presence of asbestos) and safety risks (fire resistance of structures, too great a depth underground), problems in regulatory compliance or simply obsolescence. A call for candidates is therefore organized in order to designate a design team for the conception and the architectural and technical oversight of execution of works.  The call for candidates is international and open to all individuals, companies or groups of companies from OECD Member-countries. The operation will primarily consist in: (a) Asbestos removal from the building complex referred to as the "New Building" and its redevelopment; (b) Works on the Chateau and associated conference rooms to ensure compliance with safety regulations; (c) adaptation of conference facilities on-site to meet the needs of the Organisation; (d) Restoration of the Chateau gardens following works.  In the end, the total useable surface space of the site, today 29 400 m?, could be extended to 33 000 m? after the suppression of temporary facilities (approximately 2 000 m?) and construction of sufficient space for conference activities. The estimated cost of the works is 55 M ? without tax (excluding the cost of asbestos removal).  Five firms will be invited to provide a design.  The estimated duration of the contract is six years.  All partners in the group shall state their joint and several responsibility. Qualifications: Service providers will be requested to submit an identification file and a dossier attesting candidates? qualification to carry out the operation. Selection criteria:  a) Candidate selection criteria (1) Architectural quality of projects already completed; (2) Qualifications of the various parties; (3) References for the team for similar projects; and (4) Relevance of the team structure and organisational procedures proposed. b) Project selection criteria: (1) Architectural and technical quality of the project; (2)  Ability to remain within the budget envelope specified for the project; (3) relevance of proposed project phases and ability of project to meet the Organisation?s constraints; (4) Flexibility and capacity of the project to evolve in function of future needs; (5) Price offer for the completion of the design and oversight of the carrying out of the project works. Other information: The call for candidates, containing more detailed information, can be found on the Internet site of the OECD under OCDE/EXD/PCM(2002)12: www.oecd.org (section call for tenders). It can also be requested from the OECD?s PCM Division at the following address:  OECD, Mr R?mi C?be, Senior Purchasing Officer -- EXD/PCM, 2, rue Andr? Pascal, 75775 Paris Cedex 16, France, tel. : 33 (1) 45 24 13 75, fax: 33 (1) 45 24 18 05, e-mail : remi.cebe@oecd.org.   The deadline for submitting candidatures is 1600 hours (Paris time) April 26, 2002.  Address all comments and requests for information to the OECD senior purchasing officer not the Department of State.

<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point is contemplating award of a contract or contracts to provide additional repair support of P-3 propeller assemblies operated on the West Coast and East Coast at Naval Air Weapons Station Point Mugu, CA; NAS Whidbey Island, WA; MCAS Kaneohe Bay, HI; NAS Brunswick, ME; NAS Jacksonville, FL; NAS Willow Grove, PA; and NAS New Orleans, LA.  Repair support required will be identified in a Statement of Work that is being developed.  The Statement of Work will provide specifics regarding tasks required to enhance propeller repair at the Intermediate Maintenance facilities. Although a complete list of maintenance actions which would be covered under the contemplated contract(s) has not been completed, the contemplated contract(s) will require performance of tasks that will require contractors to possess complete propeller test capability including, but not limited to, propeller balance, as well as the capability to replace and perform select repairs on the propeller blades as per current NAVAIR and NAVICP requirements.

One of the key considerations for award of the contemplated contract will be turn around time.  If a formal solicitation is issued, Contractors will be required to propose (1) turn around time for review and evaluation of propellers, (2) repair time and, (3) method and time for safe transportation minimizing the need for extensive disassembly or reassembly.  

Contractors desiring to be considered for this acquisition will be required to have obtained Engineering Source Approval.  If your company has not been previously approved for P-3 propeller repair or if your company's source approval is in excess of three years without any contract experience within the past three years you are encouraged to submit a source approval request.  You can access the data required to be submitted via the web at www.navicp.navy.mil/sabs/sascover.htm or obtain a printed copy by contacting Mr. David Gross at 215-697-5185.  Upon receipt of your source approval request the NAVICP will, if required, also schedule your company for a site survey.  Contractors are advised that if a solicitation is not issued, the government will not reimburse the contractor for their costs associated with the request for engineering source approval.

Interested contractors are required to advise Ms. Joy Capka, Code 0221.04 in writing within 14 days of this Request for Information of (1) your interest in this proposed acquisition and (2) your intent to submit a source approval request and date by which we will receive your submission or basis for your understanding that your company has a current engineering source approval.  Contractors shall direct source approval submissions to the Naval Inventory Control Point, 700 Robbins Ave., Philadelphia, Pa. 19111, Attn: Ms Joy Capka Code 0221.04.

<SUBJECT>58 -- PROJECT 25, VHF, OTAR-CAPABLE, LAND MOBILE RADIO INFRASTRUCTURE AND ASSOCIATED IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES
<DESC>The Wireless Management Office (WMO), U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract with Motorola, Inc., 7230 Parkway Drive, Hanover, Maryland 21076, for the purchase and implementation of a TIA-102/Project 25 (P.25) standards compliant, VHF, Land Mobile Radio (LMR) system with Over-the-Air-Rekeying (OTAR) capability.  Within ten months of contract award, the system shall incorporate P.25 compliant trunked (9600 baud control channel) operations and a packet-based infrastructure.   These requirements are established through the initial recommendations from an engineering design analysis for the Justice Wireless Network (JWN).  The infrastructure will meet the requirements of approximately 630 DOJ LMR users in a geographic area with an approximate 50 mile radius of metropolitan Seattle and Blaine, Washington.  The Government anticipates a base period of twelve months for the resultant contract with three additional option periods of one year each for maintenance and training of the implemented system.  The Government will not  purchase any subscriber equipment under this solicitation.  The Government's determination to negotiate this as a sole source contract with Motorola is based on the congressionally-mandated schedule for narrowband operations and DOJ's operational requirements for systems implementation and replacement.  After extensive interviews and discussions with the LMR manufacturing community, the Government has determined that Motorola is the only LMR manufacturer currently capable of both providing a complete P.25 compliant LMR system infrastructure with OTAR capability in the VHF band and of adding the additional features listed above to the system within ten months of the anticipated contract award date.  The DOJ intends to utilize the system infrastructure acquired under this procurement as an operational system and as a test-bed for subscriber and infrastructure equipment from multiple LMR equipment manufacturers.  As part of design planning, system staging and field acceptance testing, Motorola will be required to verify P.25 compliance.  Prior to system staging and implementation, Motorola shall fully identify to the Government any and all system features or functions that are proprietary or that are not fully identified under P.25 standards.  The Government intends to enter into an agreement to have Motorola make any proprietary data available to industry.  There is no solicitation document.  Interested parties must submit a detailed response, to include descriptions and product literature, that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that they meet the stated requirements for existing capabilities, i.e., TIA-102/Project 25 (P.25) standards compliant, VHF, Land Mobile Radio (LMR) system with Over-the-Air-Rekeying (OTAR) capability and published milestones and development plans for meeting the ten months from contract award requirement for P.25 compliant trunked (9600 baud control channel) operations and a packet-based infrastructure (for estimating purposes only, the anticipated date for contract award is July 2002).  Responses received as a result of this notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or bids, and cost or pricing data are not solicited.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon any written responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>A -- DARPA Workshop on Molecular Electronics for Chem/Bio Applications
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will conduct a workshop on novel applications of molecular electronics to detection of and response to chemical and biological agents. This workshop will be held May 29, 2002, at the Executive Conference Center in Arlington, VA.  This location adjacent to DARPA has been selected to maximize participation by Program Managers from DSO and MTO.  The workshop is a forum to critically discuss prospects for a new research program.  Thus, the workshop should not be considered to be a "bidder's meeting," an "industry day," or a "teaming meeting."  The morning agenda begins with Government presentations on the DARPA Molecular Electronics program, which has sponsored research in turning single molecules and small chemical groups into transistors and other standard components of computer chips, and in linking such devices together into complex circuits.  In 2001, the program succeeded in demonstrating a 16-bit memory circuit built with rotaxane molecules at the junctions of semiconducting crossbars.  The program next aims to demonstrate a 16 Kb memory with a density of 10 to the eleventh power/cm2.  The morning agenda continues with invited presentations by DARPA contractors on preliminary concepts for applying molecular circuits to the problems of detecting and responding to chemical and biological agents.  The afternoon agenda consists of a poster session, designed to maximize interactive communication and brainstorming between participants and DARPA Program Managers.  Posters should emphasize new ideas for applying molecular electronic components.  At the beginning of the poster session, participants will be allowed up to 5 minutes (depending on the number of participants) to give an oral summary of their poster.  Topics of interest include, but should not be restricted to, the following:  Features of molecular electronics enabling detection with zero false positives;  Molecular electronic circuits that detect single molecules and cells with a high degree of specificity;  Sugars that adhere to cell walls and provide recognition points for other bio-entities;  Molecular electronic devices that combine bio-detection molecules with electron transport of monomolecular systems.  To maximize the productivity of the workshop, all non-Government participants must make a poster presentation.  To become eligible for poster presentation, send a poster summary to bonsbc@sainc.com by Friday April 26, 2002.  The poster summary must contain (1) poster title, (2) name and affiliation of presenter, (3) contact information for notification of eligibility, and (4) one paragraph on the poster topic.  Notice of eligibility will be sent on Monday April 29, 2002.  Participants must register through the workshop website http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/index.asp?MeetingID=108 by Wednesday May 1, 2002 at 5:00 PM.
