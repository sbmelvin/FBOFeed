<SUBJECT>69--CH-53E Containerized Flight Training Device (CFTD) Baseline Configuration Upgrade (BCU) 
<SOLNBR>N6134017R0035
<CONTACT>Nicole Knight 407-380-8026 
Alternate: Robert Orozco, 407-380-4173, robert.orozco@navy.mil
<DESC>SPECIAL NOTE: Previous related postings were under RFP number N61340-16-R-1187. The last posting on 17 Mar 2017 stated the RFP number would be updated.  The RFP number has been updated to N61340-17-R-0035.

This posting is a DRAFT RFP for the CH-53E CFTD BCU.  The DRAFT RFP and associated documents are included as attachments to this posting.  The government reserves the right to include additional RFP provisions including, among other things, Organizational Conflict of Interest.

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) has a requirement for upgrades to the baseline configuration of the CH53E Containerized Flight Training Device (CFTD) 2F220 located at Marine Corps Air Stations (MCAS) Kaneohe Bay, HI.
  This requirement will be competed as a fair opportunity procurement under FAR 16.505(b) to eligible Training Systems Contract (TSC) III, LOT II small business prime contractors.  All final documents will be included in the Request for Proposals (RFP). The government is finalizing the RFP and anticipates releasing the final RFP on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov/ in April 2017.  The currently designated RFP number is N61340-16-R-1187; however that RFP number is anticipated to change to reflect a fiscal year 2017 issuance.  A notification will be issued once the RFP number is updated.

A Baseline Configuration Upgrade (BCU) is planned for two USMC CH-53E pilot training devices.
 This effort is for the modification and upgrade of the USMC Containerized Flight Training Device (CFTD), Device 2F220, at MCAS Kaneohe Bay, HI, and for the design, fabrication, installation, and test of a new CH53E CFTD Device 2F246 located at MCAS Futenma, Japan, to replace the existing CH-53E Aircrew Procedures Trainer (APT), Device 2F171. The BCU will ensure that the flight simulators continue to provide high fidelity flight training. The BCU program will incorporate technology upgrades to enhance USMC pilot level of proficiency and extend the useable life of these training devices. This effort replaces or upgrades obsolete hardware and software to include, but not be limited to: Host computer, Instructor Operator Station (IOS) computers, Program Support Equipment, Visual System, Control Loading System and the Input/Output (I/O) components.
 Both Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) equipment will be utilized to alleviate obsolescence and reduce supportability issues for the anticipated service life of the trainers. COTS will be used to the maximum extent possible.

The existing CH-53E Aircrew Procedures Trainer (APT) Device 2F171 at MCAS Futenma, Japan, is rapidly approaching its End of Life. This BCU program will enable the sundown of the 2F171device and, to support the training requirements at MCAS Futenma, a new replacement build CFTD, Device 2F246, is anticipated to be delivered and Ready for Training (RFT) in fiscal year (FY) 2020. 

Questions and comments on any documents posted regarding the subject requirement are welcomed and should be emailed to nicole.knight@navy.mil.
  Be advised that questions, comments and answers may be posted on the solicitation websites.
