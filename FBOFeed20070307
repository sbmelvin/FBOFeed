<RESPDATE>031607
<ARCHDATE>04152007
<CONTACT>Elayne. Gomes-Battle, 202-267-3610
<DESC>Anthropometrics Measurements of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Transportation System Specialists (ATSSs) THIS REQUIREMENT IS SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS.  The NAIC Code is 541330. This announcement is a Market Survey.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR).  Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Human Factors Design Standard provides a wide range of anthropometrics data to be used in the design of FAA systems, equipment, and facilities.  However, this data is based on measurements taken on Department of Defense (DoD) military personnel.  Some of the data is based on surveys and studies that were conducted over 50 years ago.  Furthermore, the use of DoD data may not be applicable to the FAA's Air Transportation System Specialist (ATSS) workforce.  To that end, it is desirable to collect anthropometrics measurements from members of the ATSS workforce.   The FAA is seeking potential sources that have the ability to conduct such measurements.  The effort entails determination of the required sample size, develop data collection sheets, perform the required data collection, analyze the data collected, and prepare an update to the FAA Human Factors Design Standard based on the results.  It is envisioned that there will be 25-30 measurements per individual. The contractor will be required to travel to various FAA sites (potentially up to 35) to perform the data collection.  These site visits will be coordinated by the FAA.  In order to minimize the time that the ATSS personnel need to be away from their duties, it is envisioned that there will be separate stations established; one for standing measurements and one for seated measurements.  Personnel to measure the individuals as well as record the data will be required at each station.  In addition, as measurements will be made on female personnel, at least one female measurer will be required.   In order to make determination the FAA require the following information from interested vendors.  Below are the minimum requirements the interested vendor must possess: 1.	Experience in planning and executing large-scale anthropometric measurement, data collection and analysis projects similar to the proposed FAA task 2.	Experience with International standard ISO 15535:2003 "General Requirements for Establishing Anthropometric Databases" 3.	An in-depth understanding of the purpose, structure, and application of FAA Human Factors Design Standards HF-STD-001 4.	Experience in translating substantial amounts of collected anthropometric data into a format suitable for inclusion into engineering design standards such as HF-STD-001 5.	Experience in training measurement team members to the requisite skill level necessary for conducting detailed anthropometric studies Responses to this market survey must contain the following information: •	A capability of summary of not more than 10 pages demonstrating your ability to satisfy the 5 requirements listed above on 8 ½ x11 paper size and 12 point font summarizing your relevant prior work.  You should also include a corporate summary and provide your company's website URL.  •	Completed business declaration form identifying your size status and NAICS. The FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Business Declaration form is required to be completed, signed, and submitted with your response to this solicitation.  Vendors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov/ at the time of receipt of proposals. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this market survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense. All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to 10 pages.  The period of performance for this requirement shall be no more than 2 years based on the availability of funding. Parties interested that can meet the requirements should reply via email, by close of business March 16, 2007 to the Contract Specialist, Elayne.Gomes-Battle@faa.gov.

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

Largely because of global economic pressures, the development and fabrication of advanced ICs is migrating offshore. In addition, commercial, rather then military, demand is increasingly driving business models. Dedicated facilities (National Security Agency [NSA], Sandia, Honeywell, etc.) cannot provide the performance, variety, and volume of ICs at the cost the Department of Defense (DoD) needs. These trends have raised concerns regarding U.S. weapons systems reliance on high-performance ICs and the potential vulnerabilities of these systems caused by malicious manipulation of hardware and software processes that could render them inoperable at some future time. This situation is true for some ICs currently in use, such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), and for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) configurable parts, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). Furthermore, protecting intellectual property and military secrets is problematic because these are often embedded in the design of ICs, and the manufacturer in the fabrication process often needs the details of the designs. 

This new DARPA initiative is tailored to address the above issues and others identified in the Defense Science Board (DSB) study on High-Performance Microchip Supply (http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2005-02-HPMS_Report_Final.pdf). The report addresses design, use of advanced design tools, fabrication, packaging, testing, and monitoring of high-performance ICs. TRUST in ICs addresses the fundamental problem of determining whether a microchip manufactured through a process that is inherently (untrusted) (i.e., not under our control) can be (trusted) to perform operations only as specified by the design, and no more. To be clear, DARPA is only interested in issues related to TRUSTed ICs and is not interested in proposals pertaining to issues concerning printed circuit boards or malicious software in general. 

The trustworthiness of ICs used in the DoD and intelligence community is a long-standing and recognized issue, dating back to before the migration of fabrication processes to foreign foundries became so prevalent. The DoD (Trusted Foundry Program), which regulates and maintains U.S.-owned and operated fabrication facilities, was created to address these concerns. However, as highlighted in the DSB report referenced above, the Trusted Foundry Program is viewed as a partial solution to a problem of growing concern. Although the Trusted Foundry Program is an important and useful program, the DARPA TRUST Program is intended to develop technologies that can provide trust in the absence of a trusted foundry. This DARPA effort is not intended to supplant the Trusted Foundry Program or improve its processes or capabilities. It will only consider technical efforts that address fabrication of ASICs via non-trusted foundries and software implementation of configurable hardware, such as FPGAs. In addition to benefiting the DoD by ensuring the trust of ICs manufactured offshore, this program will benefit high-security commercial interests by developing technologies that offer rigorous validation of IC hardware and its design regardless of where the design or manufacturing processes take place.

PERIOD OF SOLICITATION/DUE DATES

This BAA will remain open from 7 March 2007 through 7 March 2008.  For consideration during the initial round of selections, proposers are required to submit proposals by 23 April 2007. However, proposals received after this deadline may be evaluated up to 1 year from date of posting.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION

Proposals shall be submitted electronically using the following submission method:

DARPA/MTO will employ an electronic upload process, the Technical Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS) Proposal Submission System, for proposal submissions to this BAA.  Electronic proposals should be in Microsoft Word format or PDF and submitted via a web site interface: Web Site: https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa.  

Organizations planning to submit proposals must register at http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa.   Only the lead or prime organization should register.  One registration per proposal should be submitted.  This means that an organization wishing to submit to multiple technical topic areas should complete a single registration for each proposal.  By registering, the Proposer has made no commitment to submit.  The deadline for T-FIMS registration is 9 April 2007.  Please note: if the registration date is missed, the offeror may not be able to upload their proposal by the published proposal submission due date.  

Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded. DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA 07-24,TRUST in Integrated Circuits (TIC), Proposer Information Pamphlet, which provides further information on technical areas of interest to DARPA as well as detailed proposal preparation/submission instructions.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below. Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed. 

Please pay attention for an announcement of an upcoming bidders conference in support of BAA 07-24.

This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 07-24 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA. No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received and to make awards without discussion. In the event that DARPA desires to award only portions of a proposal, negotiations will be opened with that offeror. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only". Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for these organizations' participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Trusted Integrated Circuits.

DARPA/MTO anticipates proposals submitted under this BAA may be classified.  Instructions regarding such submissions are provided in the associated BAA PIP.   

Any questions regarding the TRUST in Integrated Circuits (TIC) BAA, BAA07-24, please send them to the BAA e-mail address, BAA07-24@darpa.mil.  Answers to all frequently asked questions and any questions seeking technical clarification will be posted on the MTO Solicitations webpage,
http://www.darpa.mil/mto/solicitations, under the BAA07-24 section.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposal white papers and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities, related experience, and relevant past experience, (5) schedule reaslism, and (6) cost realism. Cost/price reasonableness will be made prior to award.

Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.

<DESC>As part of the U.S. Department of Energy Building America Program (BAP), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) in Spring of 2007 to create industry partnerships to provide research support for the accelerated development of cost effective Zero Energy Homes (ZEH). A ZEH offsets as much source energy as it consumes on an annual basis by integrating energy efficient design with use of residential photovoltaic systems. The goal of the BAP is to develop innovative system engineering approaches to advanced housing that will enable the U.S. housing industry to deliver energy efficient, affordable and environmentally sensitive housing while maintaining the profitability and competitiveness of US homebuilders and product suppliers in domestic and overseas markets.

For innovative building energy technologies to be viable candidates over conventional approaches, it must be demonstrated that new technologies can cost-effectively increase overall housing value and quality while significantly reducing energy use when used in community scale developments.  To make this determination, an extensive system research program is necessary to develop, test and design advanced residential energy systems for all major U. S. climate regions in conjunction with material suppliers, equipment manufacturers, developers, builders, designers, utilities, and state and local stakeholders.

The BAP is based on systems research with industry teams to identify opportunities for cost and performance trade-offs that improve whole-building performance and value while minimizing source energy use and minimizing increases in overall building cost.  Price participation (cost sharing) will be required. Building America research specifically targets technical barriers that limit residential energy performance including analysis of technology pathways leading to ZEH, evaluation of advanced energy systems relative to residential needs, testing of prototype houses, testing of initial production scale housing, and final evaluation of community scale developments. 

Work will include analysis of system performance and cost tradeoffs as they relate to whole building energy performance and cost optimization, including interactions between advanced envelope designs, mechanical and electrical systems, lighting systems, space conditioning systems, hot water systems, appliances, miscellaneous electric loads, energy control systems, and onsite power generating systems. Use of a systems approach will create construction process and technology innovations that improve efficiency and flexibility of housing production and increase control over component interactions that improve house efficiency and performance.

Use of a systems approach will also accelerate development and adoption of new technologies by promoting effective coordination between the design and construction process, increasing system performance, increasing system cost effectiveness, and increasing system reliability and durability. Community-scale evaluation of advanced system concepts in partnership with builders, contractors, utilities, and state and local governments, will provide opportunities for industry leaders to directly contribute key results to the BA research program. 

Multiple awards are expected under the RFP.  Total annual funding for awards under the RFP is estimated to be $30 million/year. Each award will be reviewed and renewed on an annual basis based on satisfactory performance for a total period not to exceed 5 years. More information on BAP research activities can be found at www.buildingamerica.gov. 

This information is intended to provide notice of an anticipated NREL solicitation so that interested organizations may anticipate the solicitation release.  This notice is not intended, and should not be construed, as a request for proposals, information, or interest and no response is requested at this time.  When issued, the solicitation will be posted at the following website:

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole source contract to Sea-Bird Electronics Incorporated (SBE), 1808 136th Place NE, Bellevue, Washington for the acquisition of twenty-five (25) SBE 19-plus Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) Optics-Ready Profilers (NAVOCEANO configuration).  The CTD systems being acquired are urgently needed to support mission essential operations aboard Navy military helicopters and ships supporting Mine Warfare (MIW) operations.  Because optical mine hunting systems are migrating to the fleet, the U. S. Navy has an immediate need to increase their optics/CTD sensor package deployments on military platforms.  These sensors provide data in support of other sensors used for oceanography, hydrography, ASW, home land security, MIW, Naval Special Warfare, and many other mission related tasks.  There are no other contractors other than Sea Bird that can provide a CTD that meets all of the U.S. Navy requirements.  Any!   changes to these requirements would adversely impact the mission of NAVOCEANO and our support to the MIW community.  Additionally, the U.S. Navy already has an enormous inventory of the same/similar Sea Bird sensors being purchased in this contract.    Changing vendors or instrumentation would call for a significant increase in funding to re-engineer current CTD/optics systems.  This would also require additional maintenance dollars and training programs to ensure data collection and database population.  Sea Bird has the required expertise to provide necessary calibrations and repairs to these COTS units.  Staying with COTS available instrumentation provides the greatest financial benefit for the government.

The computer boards, flash card boards, RAM, RS-422 boards, Ethernet controllers and cables being procured are required to fabricate the Amphibious Assault Direction System (AADS) workstations that will be installed on ships deploying in 4QTRFY07.  This material is identical to the material that is currently installed in the fleet.  W!  insystems is the only manufacturer of this material.  These specific components have gone through the shock and vibration testing required for certification of its safety for shipboard installation.  Purchase of any other manufacturer's components would require duplication of the shock and vibration testing performed on the Winsystems components at a cost estimated to exceed the cost of the components being procured.  Accordingly, Winsystems is the only source for these components.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest, San Diego, California, is preparing to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Remedial Action Contract (RAC V) for Environmental Remediation Services at various Department of Defense (DoD) sites in Alaska, Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and other DoD sites nationwide as deemed necessary to meet workload requirements.  The resulting Contract will be a Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a ceiling of $100,000,000.

This procurement is unrestricted for competition amongst all interested firms.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Service. 

This contract focuses primarily on environmental restoration projects but could involve other environmental work such as compliance projects.  These services may include actions, such as, but not limited to, the following: performing remedial actions; performing removal actions; performing expedited and emergency response actions at sites; performing pilot and treatability studies; providing facility operation, maintenance and instruction; and performing other related activities associated with returning sites to safe and acceptable levels.  The contaminants will include, but not be limited to, those identified and regulated under RCRA, CERCLA, Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL). A relatively small number of sites may require remediation of radiological or ordnance waste or unexploded ordnance (UXO), discarded military munitions (DMM), munitions constituents (eg. TNT, RDX).  The contaminants included are predominately solvents, POL, metals, acids, bases, reactives, non-explosive ordnance residues or compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides.  Contaminants may be present in soils, sediments, ground water, air, sludge, surface water, and man-made structures.  Contaminated sites may be landfills, hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities, tanks, lagoons, fire fighting training areas, or other facilities.

Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and FAR Supplement as applicable.  A contract will be awarded to the responsible firm whose proposal, conforms to the solicitation, and is determined the "Best Value" to the Government based on cost and non cost factors.  The resulting contract will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services will be included in the resulting contract.  The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001.  The Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in the solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract.  The minimum guarantee of $200,000 applies to the five-year term of the contract.  The aggregate value of delivery orders issued under the contract will not exceed $100,000,000.

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors:  Factor 1 - Past Performance; Factor 2 - Commitment to Socio-Economic Programs; Factor 3 - Financial and Management Systems; Factor 4 - Specialized Experience; Factor 5 - Technical Approach (PTO 0001); Factor 6 - Contract Management; Factor 7 - Safety; and Factor 8 - Cost/Price Proposal.  All technical evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important than Factor 8 ? Cost/Price.  While cost/price to the Government is a consideration, it will not be the overriding basis for contract award.  The proposed cost/price and other non-price factors will be evaluated to determine the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price proposal.

A pre-proposal site visit for the Proposed Task Order 0001 project will be held at the Alameda Point, Alameda, CA.  The site visit will be conducted on 3 April 2007 at 10:00AM PST.  All firms interested in attending the site visit must submit the following information by email to gina.snider@navy.mil no later than 29 March 2007 at 10:00 AM PST:  Full name of individual(s) attending, position/title, company name, citizenship, email address, phone and fax numbers.  Costs associated with participating in the pre-proposal site visit/meeting or responding the solicitation will not be compensated.

<SUBJECT>10 -- THEATER BATTLE MANAGEMENT CORE SYSTEMS (TBMCS) SUSTAINMENT
<SOLNBR>R1501
<CONTACT>John Travieso john.travieso@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR THEATER BATTLE MANAGEMENT CORE SYSTEMS (TBMCS) SUSTAINMENT This is a Request for Information/ Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS).  Electronics Systems Center, 350th ELSG/PK, is requesting information from companies having sufficient sustainment experience for a potential contract to provide maintenance and sustainment for TBMCS Force Level (FL) and Unit Level (UL) systems.  Additional support will be needed for TBMCS operations within the Air and Space Operations Centers (AOCs) as well as on-going Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases. This new contract is envisioned to support sustainment and maintenance of all capabilities associated with TBMCS FL and UL. This contract will cover sustainmant and maintenance of deployed systems with Joint Partners (Army, Navy and Marine Corp) and at worldwide locations (including US, Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific region).  The typical TBMCS fielded system consists of approximately 1.25 million source lines of newly developed code and an additional 4.75 million lines of code associated with proprietary off-the-shelf and other products integrated into TBMCS. Specifically this sustainment contract is envisioned to accommodate the following: TBMCS Force Level  The TBMCS Force Level (FL) program has Spiral 1.1.3 fielded as the system of record. The current development contractor is working towards Spiral 1.1.4.  The sustainment contract will serve broad-level needs of this Joint Interest TBMCS ACAT 1AC program.  TBMCS provides hardware, software, and communications interfaces to support the preparation, modification, and dissemination of the Force-level Air Battle Plan (ABP).  The sustainment contractor would provide sustainment/maintenance support for hardware and software products as well as communications interfaces.  The sustainment contractor will be needed to ensure continuity in sustainment/support of the fielded TBMCS baselines.  In addition, the sustainment contractor will need to provide Help Desk Support, Security Support, training,  Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software licensing, and any other support required for sustaining and maintaining the fielded TBMCS FL baseline.  TBMCS Unit Level  TBMCS UL has fielded Spiral 8.5 as the System of Record (SOR) at approximately 50 locations worldwide.  (The current development contractor is working towards Spiral 8.5N and 9.05 which the TBMCS sustainment contractor would be required to sustain).   TBMCS unit-level operations and intelligence applications provide Air Force Wings the capability to receive the ABP, parse it, and manage wing operations and intelligence to support execution of the ABP.   The sustainment contractor would provide sustainment and maintenance support for hardware and software products as well as communications interfaces at the TBMCS UL level similar to those provided at Force Level. The sustainment contract will be needed to provide sustainment, Help Desk, Security Support, training, Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software licensing, and any other support required for the fielded TBMCS UL baseline. All requirements associated with future fielding of Unit Level C&C (UC2) Spiral 1 and 2 would be performed under a separate contract vehicle.  Air and Space Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS) TBMCS is the "engine" for the AOC Weapon System (AOC WS).  The sustainment  contractor will provide sustainment and maintenance to all TBMCS fielded applications, including the 23 fielded TBMCS applications at Air and Space Operation Centers (AOC) expected to be in use around the globe. These include Center locations in regions such as the Middle East and East Asia from which the Commander who oversees all U.S., allied and coalition aircraft in a theater of operations can execute an air campaign and direct space support and information operations activities.  Sustainment and maintenance under this contract will address maintenance of all TBMCS interfaces linked to the approximately 25  Third Party Applications programs. The sustainment contractor will need to effectively interact with the AOC WS Integration  (AOC WSI) contractor during deployment and operation of AOC Weapon Systems. TBMCS Foreign Military Sales and International Agreements The sustainment contractor will perform sustainment/maintenance support on a case by case basis for on-going or future Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases or direct sales applications.  There are current Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases with Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Australia has fielded TBMCS and  the UK is evaluating TBMCS capabilities for possible fielding.  Canada has partially fielded TBMCS with the system currently employed in their integration labs and training centers.  Sustainment would involve maintaining fielded TBMCS baselines and may involve Government Furnished Information (GFI),  software procurement and licensing, and direct support  for repairs, changes or upgrades at foreign  TBMCS sites. Government provided disclosure guidelines covering foreign disclosure would be followed in all sustainment/maintenance support efforts.  The 350th ELSG/PK is conducting market research for the contemplated sustainment contract.  Potential offerors with the required tools, experience and core capabilities for maintenance and sustainment of TBMCS systems are encouraged to provide a white paper detailing core capabilities, tools, and experience that address and /or meet these requirements.  If there are potential offerors who believe they have the core capabilities, existing tools, and experience that address and /or meet the requirements outlined in this SSS, please submit a Qualification Package containing the following: 1) Experience in the sustainment of TBMCS Spiral software (or equal Command and Control C2 software), 2) Capability to sustain fielded, large scale, software intensive C2 systems without compromising schedule or Air Force obligations, 3) Capability to perform testing/regression testing and to resolve hardware/software issues resulting from baseline changes in fielded systems  i.e. mandatory Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC), Technical Change Notification Orders (TCNOs), and Group Policy Objects (GPO) upgrades,  4) Maintain all documentation required for help desk, maintenance and training,  and  5)  Availability of resources to sustain large scale, software intensive fielded systems, including but not limited to: a. Qualified Staff with current secret/top secret clearances for selected key personnel at time of award,  b. Adequate facilities, including labs, for analyses and testing (which includes classified communication capabilities) to maintain system baselines.

A requirements contract is anticipated for estimated quantities EXCEPT for fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which is excluded since awarded by VAMC Houston.  Minimal backup supplies of FFP may be requested if not available from the primary contractor.  This procurement is authorized by FAR 6.302.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The exception sets "Aerospace Equipment" small business definition size limit as $25M see document below. Revision 1: to correct Size Standard NAIC code 541330 From $6.5M To $4.5M 3 yr Avg In Accordance with U.S. Business Administration) Program Management, Acquisition Management, System Engineering, Operations Planning for the FAA Office of Technology Development  This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.1.3.12.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is an informational announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents at this time. PURPOSE:   The purpose of this market survey is to: 1) inform Industry of an upcoming procurement;  2) solicit comments on the Statement of Work; 3) assess market interest and capability of potential offerors. BACKGROUND: The Directorate of Operations Planning Technology Development Services, ATO-P  provides aviation engineering services that are an integral component of the National Airspace System (NAS) planning and operational system.  The NAS provides the flying public with air traffic control services designed to ensure air transportation safety.  ATO-P is responsible for providing technical and engineering direction and program management for multiple projects through various stages of development and NAS implementation.  ATO-P must satisfy the technical requirements of the NAS as envisioned and implemented by the FAA. The Draft Statement of work (SOW) is attached.  Included are specific project tasks and general tasks. A Screening Information Request (SIR) is anticipating being released in late March early April 2007. We are considering use of a Cost Reimbursement "Cost Plus Fixed Fee" type contract.  The government estimate for this procurement is approximately $9 Million over a 5 year period.   Responses to the below Capability Statement questions are to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competitive procurement for small business. The North American Industry Classification Code designated for this procurement is 541330 Engineering Services, with the exception definition of "Except Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons $25.0 M.   This classification with the exception uses $25M Million annual gross sales 3 year average as the threshold to be considered a small business.  The FAA requests the following information from interested vendors: 1. Capability Statement - Please answer the following questions: A. Has your firm provided similar type services or supported similar type Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) programs as described in the SOW. How recently?  If so please elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance. B. Please provide additional comments regarding the SOW and any other relative comments and suggestions.  2. Discuss expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.). If respondent is an SBA 8(a) certified business, or other small business, provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent. 3. Completion of the attached Business Declaration form. And if applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor's exclusion from the competition.  However, the failure of adequate small business participation in this market survey may result in the government determining there are not sufficient qualified small business' interested to set aside this procurement  for small business. Therefore, a full and open competition would be considered.  Interested companies can register for future announcements related to this and any procurement by Going to the FAA Website address: "http://www.asu.faa.gov/faaco/index.cfm, which is the "Contract Opportunities" site.  Should you want the e-mail automatic notification of FAA opportunities you may look under the column "Main Menu" and click on e-Mail Auto-Notify System.  The FAA is not liable for costs associated with a response to this informational announcement.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is an informational announcement.  No solicitation exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page.  It is the potential Offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation. To ensure full consideration of vendor comments your responses to this notice are requested by March 16, 2007. Federal Aviation Administration ATTN:  Stephen M.

<DESC>The Military Sealift Command (MSC) is improving the capabilities of the T-AH 19 Class hospital ships to provide humanitarian support.  A significant component of this will be the addition of two tender boats (one each port and starboard).  The tender boats will provide passenger and patient transfer between the hospital ship and locations inaccessible to large vessels.

To conserve weather deck space, two existing open-topped lifeboats and their associated davits will be removed to provide deck space for the tender boats and their davits.  To compensate for the resulting reduction in overall lifeboat capacity, the tender boats will be required to serve in the dual role of tender and lifeboat.  

MSC plans to issue a requirement for one (1) ship set, with an option for one (1) additional ship set, of combination cruise tender/lifeboats.  A ship set is defined as two (2) combination cruise tender/lifeboats, two (2) SOLAS lifeboat davits, and two (2) SOLAS lifeboat winches.  The updated issue date for the solicitation is 7-9 March 2007.  The solicitation will be posted to the MSC website (http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil/procurement/contract/RFPSearchEntry.jsp).

Interoperability of the components is essential to functional system; components not certified by Enturst and Safenet may prove non-functional in this configuration.  At this time, Entrust nor Safenet cannot guarantee that products purchased from sources other than Safenet will support the continued operation of the Departments PKI. IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires SafeNet Luna products to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (c), is cited at the statutory authority. Entrust and Safenet will only provide support for products purchased from Entrust or Safenet.  If there are support issues on product not purchased through Entrust or Safenet, they will defer to the supplier of the product.  Maintenance of these products is required to ensure that any problems with the equipment will be rectified immediately by Entrust and Safenet.  Installation of  a different hardware security module may have the following issues: 1.	Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configuration, voiding other warranties associated with the equipment and software. 2.	Interoperability cannot be guaranteed. 3.	Support fro functional enhancements made to the system, as part of the PKI or future medications cannot be guaranteed to be supported.<BR><BR>

INTRODUCTION: A considerable amount of data and information has been and continues to be gathered in the course of research conducted for the MMS Environmental Studies Program. In addition, other agencies, academia, and industry consultants have collected and continue to collect environmental data in the OCS Regions as well. To improve the accessibility, use and exchange of this information, the MMS Alaska Regional Office conducts public meetings with a variety of formats. The meetings are of 3-day duration; workshops may be shorter,1-to-2 days in length, and focus on a single discipline or topic.  The general format of the two types of meetings is essentially the same.  The meetings and workshops shall be documented in proceedings.  The contractor shall provide support for up to 2 Information Transfer Meetings (ITMs) and 2 workshops during a maximum 3 year period.  Also, the contractor shall provide for pre-meeting plans, advertising, letters of invitation, procurement of meeting facilities, meeting logistics and staffing, and post-meeting reports.  The contractor must be capable of performing all of the tasks described herein.  SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations must submit a capability statement to the Contracting Officer specified for receipt, demonstrating that they are qualified to perform the work and verification that the organization qualifies under the NAICS code 541990.  The capability statement shall not exceed 25 pages (on 8.5" x11" paper, single sided print, with a font of 10 points or higher).  Any pages in excess of 25 will not be evaluated.  The capability statement should describe in detail: (A) Key personnel with the education, professional credentials, knowledge, and publications in relevant disciplines. Relevant disciplines are physical oceanography, fate and effects of marine contaminants, marine biology, protected marine species, and social science and economics. Relevant knowledge includes knowledge of the relationship of oil and gas activity on the Outer Continental Shelf to the environment and knowledge of the environmental studies supporting documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act.  Key personnel with expertise, education, and experience to carry out the following tasks: 1. Plan Information Transfer and Information Update Meetings/Workshops. 2.

EVALUATION OF CAPABILITY STATEMENT:  Your Capability Statement must demonstrate that both your organization and key personnel can successfully meet MMS requirements when Factor A (key personnel) is of equal importance to Factor B (organizational experience and expertise), and Factor C (references) is less important than Factors A and B.  We will evaluate the size and complexity of similar projects completed by the proposed project team and your organization, including past performance, to determine your potential for contract award and project success.  Past performance consists of adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of cost control, the acceptability of services delivered, the Offeror's willingness to cooperate with the customer in both routine matters and when confronted by unexpected difficulties, and the Offeror's business integrity.  If you believe the Government may find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your organization to address the problem.  Scientific personnel must demonstrate relevant experience in the scientific disciplines demonstrated through authorship in appropriate peer reviewed publications.  The qualifications of subcontracts and partners will also be considered.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with BioServe Space Technologies in the Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences at the University of Colorado. The Experimental Properties of Fluids Group at NIST is the only laboratory in the world that operates piezoelectric torsional crystal viscometers for standard reference viscosity measurements of gases and liquids in wide ranges of pressure and temperature. The Experimental Properties of Fluids Group has been tasked by the U.S. Air Force, Office of Scientific Research and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to measure the viscosity of jet fuels and rocket propellants. The NIST Experimental Properties of Fluids Group has additional needs to perform viscosity measurements of aviation turbine fuels in the temperature range 300 K to 600 K with pressures to 68 MPa, and to analyze the measured raw data in terms of equivalent electrical circuit models of nonlinear resonators. These tasks require an unusually broad and unique set of skills including the conditioning and mounting of electrolytically purified piezoelectric quartz crystals as torsionally vibrating viscosity sensors, verification of their measurement sensitivity and performance, expertise in complex data acquisition electronics, the implementation of sophisticated data acquisition software using the Lab View graphical programming language, and the NIST software package ODRPACK for nonlinear orthogonal distance regression analysis, and advanced knowledge of molecular momentum transfer processes in liquids and gases. Only the University of Colorado has the unique set of skills in microsystems design, broad expertise in complex electronics and piezoelectric transducers, sophisticated data acquisition programming and advanced molecular momentum transfer processes that is needed for this project.  No commercial vendor has been located that offers such broad ranging services.  This requirement is a continuation of work begun in September 2005 to continue through April 30, 2008. This requirement involves research using Government owned equipment.

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Under $100,000). This synopsis is issued for information purposes. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or email. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Any questions regarding this notice shall be submitted in writing to Doris Turner (e-mail preferred) no later than close of business March 23, 2007.  Anticipated award date is March 30, 2007.

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this RFI.

1.0  Description

1.1 The United States Coast Guard (USCG) issues this RFI regarding Commercial SATCOM X-Band maritime terminals and services for market research, informational, and planning purposes only.  The USCG is searching and considering alternative satellite communications capabilities to provide improved performance over the existing INMARSAT equipment and services. X-Band is one potential alternative that may provide higher bandwidth while also supporting both voice and data. Responses may be used in developing budget request and contract specifications for next generation commercial maritime terminals and services.

2.0  Background

2.1  U. S. Coast Guard cutters are currently equipped with Inmarsat Type Approved, CN-17 compliant, Nera Saturn Bm terminals that provide the following on-demand and lease capabilities: 16 kbps voice, secure voice (STU-III), 9.6 kbps G3 facsimile, 9.6 kbps asynchronous data, and 64 kbps synchronous data as well as legacy 64 kbps, 100 kHz full period leases that are currently accessed through an Inmarsat commercial satellite service provider.   To augment the terminals? 64 kbps internal modem capability, the Coast Guard is fielding the 128K enhanced external modem upgrade, which consists of an Interface Control Unit (ICU) and Comtech 550T Satellite Modem. This field change allows the Coast Guard to operate at 128 kbps in 100 kHz full period leases or 64 kbps in split 50 kHz channels.  In addition to the 128K enhancement the Coast Guard is also fielding a compression engine. Dedicated terrestrial lines connect commercial Land Earth Stations to Coast Guard communication facilities located in Virginia and California.

2.2  The Saturn Bm terminals include a key-operated emission control switch that disables transmit but still allow the terminal to receive.  The removable key provides a method for positive control over each terminal?s transmit function.  It should be assumed that these non-standard commercial options would continue to be required. 

2.3  The Coast Guard is particularly looking for X-Band maritime equipment that provides a similar form, fit and recurring expense as the Nera Saturn Bm terminal.

	a.  Antenna weight including radome shall not exceed 250 lbs.
	b.  Radome volume shall not exceed 104ft cubed.  Shape minimizes radar cross
                 radar cross section.
	c.  Standard equipment rack available volume (approximately 19in x 72in x33in) 
                 for below deck equipment.

The Coast Guard is also interested in smaller terminals which could accommodate our various aircraft and cutters 110? and smaller. 

2.4  The X-Band solution shall provide reasonable coverage of the earth?s surface with global and/or spot beam coverage primary focused on the Pacific and Atlantic ocean regions and Alaska

3.0 Requested Information
The primary focus in this submittal should be on areas related to the X-Band alternative described in this RFI.  Respondents interested in providing a response to this RFI should submit information which clearly describes the following:

3.1 Company Capabilities.

3.2 Standard product lines including X-Band services and terminals of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace or modified to meet the USCG needs.  If your company believes that items in your standard product line would meet the need described in this RFI, relevant product literature may be included in the submittal.

3.3 X-band maritime and aviation terminal and antenna, features and specifications 
including but not limited to: size, weight, stabilization, power requirements, and required navigation inputs such as shipboard gyro.

3.4 Geographic coverage areas including hemispherical, regional, and spot beam 
footprints.  Specify beam size in nautical miles and if the beam(s) coverage area is movable.  

3.5  Maritime terminals transition requirements between spot beam footprints (e.g. seamless transition between spot beam footprints with no ship user intervention required). 

3.6  Typical data rates including symmetrical/asymmetrical point-to-point and point to 
multi-point configurations.

3.7  Network Management features including control of power, bandwidth, and 
Frequency assignments.

3.8  System security, including but not limited to network protection (i.e. physical 
security and encryption).

3.9  Estimated rough order of magnitude to include equipment investment (ship & shore) versus recurring service cost (e.g. full period, cost per bit, or shared access), other cost drivers and estimates.

3.10 Projected useful life of the equipment and service including maintenance and 
upgrade schedules.

3.11 Current availability of the technology, brief history including customer base/major customers, years in service, related reliability data, and estimated delivery time once ordered.

3.12	Business size in accordance with NAICS Code (Official NAICS Code will be 
selected upon a solicitation being released), Dun and Bradstreet number, and any other Government contracts held for this X-Band alternative including GSA Schedule should your firm hold one.  If your firm has recently submitted a proposal with any Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, or other U.S. Federal Government activities, please indicate this with your submission to include agency?s name, solicitation number, and Contracting Officer?s name and point of contact information..

3.13 Any other information that your company feels is pertinent to this acquisition.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  There is no solicitation package available.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is seeking Small Business sources that may be capable of producing a Differential Angle Protractor unit.  The Differential Angle Protractor is used to measure Main Rotor Blade angles during Flight Control Rigging Check at sea.  Movement of the aircraft while at sea precludes the use of a conventional protractor to obtain the measurements accurately.  In addition, the unit will be required to be designed to minimize or eliminate susceptibility to corrosion in a salt environment.  NAICS code 334519 applies.  The United States Navy is investigating the feasibility of procuring this requirement through a capable Small Business and therefore all interested parties should send company's capability and/or descriptive literature, as well business experience in providing a similar product, similarity of environment and past performance, which should identify contracts and/or subcontracts awarded for identical or similar units.  Information listed may include units delivered to the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments, and commercial customers.  Send response, literature and/or any comments or questions to Nancy Delaney, e-mail: Nancy.Delaney@navy.mil, fax: (732) 323-2359 or address: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Contracts, Code 25221ND, B562-3, Hwy 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082.  All responses should be received no later than 4:00 PM EST, 22 March 2007.  All questions and comments must be in writing, no telephone calls, email is acceptable.

<DESC>This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI). It is anticipated that a Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this request will be issued subsequently.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) will not issue paper copies of this request.  The responses to this RFI will be considered in the planning and definition of the future Integrated Topside Program (IT Program).  This is not a commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request.  The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request.  This is not a request for proposals, and a solicitation is not available at this time.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SEEKS ONLY EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST AND TECHNICAL CAPABILITY FROM PARTIES.

Background:

The number of topside apertures present on Navy ships has increased significantly in the past decade.  This has led to problems with Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI), Radar Cross Section (RCS) and the overall performance of critical ship Electronic Warfare (EW), and communication functions.  With the goals of reducing ship RCS, freeing up space to allow for smaller deckhouses, reducing cost and improving overall performance, ONR has several programs working on innovative apertures that combine several functions and efforts to provide key functionality.  The architecture of these systems is based on a modular open architecture approach to allow for future upgrades at less cost and reduced time to implement.  Several of these programs are transitioning now or are slated to transition to DDG-1000.  

No one program has taken a truly systems level engineering approach to developing an integrated topside that is optimized, open, and scalable to meet future needs.  Funding for the IT Program will come under the auspices of the Navy?s Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) initiative.  The IT Program will cover communications, electronic warfare and low power (navigation) Radar functions.  The program will consist of multiple spirals and will build off of several ONR EW and communication efforts already underway (i.e., Multi-function Electronic Warfare System (MFEW), Modular Integrated Link Electronic Systems (MILES) and array development for Satellite Communications (SATCOM)).  During the first three years, emphasis will be placed on an overall architecture framework, open interface standards and SATCOM communications.  Subsequent spirals will include additional functionality.  As spirals are completed, it is anticipated that the developed capability can be spun off for implementation in the fleet.  The goal of the program is to evolve to an integrated capability for the Navy over the next 5-10 years that has the following characteristics:

?	Ability to tailor all radio frequency (RF) resources for any given operational scenario in real time
?	Modular open RF architecture
?	Software defined functionality
?	Synchronization of RF functions for mission support and EMI mitigation
?	Reduced size, weight and power requirements relative to a federated topside system
?	Reduced cost (acquisition and total ownership) relative to a federation of systems  
?	Scalable in order to derive systems of appropriate capability to match each particular platform?s requirements
?	More RF functions optimally sited on topside
?	Rapid adaptability to new threats through software waveform upgrades


Specific Areas of Interest:

?	Recommendations on how best to define systems? partition  for electronics and arrays that will allow for technology advancement while providing the ability to have multiple vendors involved in developing subsystems/components within the system.   This should include defining a common approach to ?form and fit? to the sub-array level.
?	Recommended way that industry/government should proceed with defining open system standards for the interfaces of the partitions defined.
?	Assess where you see RF requirements evolving to meet operational needs of the fleet in 2020.
?	Describe how to develop the architecture and standards such that they could also apply to airborne and ground applications as well and the practicality of such an approach.
?	Define the business case from both the government and industry perspectives for the Navy to acquire an integrated RF approach and compare that to the Navy?s current approach of acquiring federated systems.  Define any impediments that need to be addressed in order to make an integrated RF approach practical.
?	Define improvements in operational capability, hardware and software maintenance, training, logistics, etc. that would evolve from integrated RF systems that are currently not available with contemporary federated systems.
?	With the short three-year spiral to implement a SATCOM capability concurrently with defining an overall architecture, define how you would address this complexity and evolve the SATCOM capability to the integrated topside architecture in a later spiral.
       
Submissions
Responses should not exceed 30 total pages (exclusive of cover page) and should contain the following information: cover page labeled ?Integrated Topside? with RFI number ONR-07-RFI-0006, technical point of contact, telephone number, fax numbers, and e-mail address.

<SUBJECT>99--UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE INDUSTRY DAY TO INFORM INDUSTRY OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION'S CONSENT ORDER REGARDING UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. The Department of Defense, National Security Space Office, intends to hold a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Industry Day. The purpose of the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Industry Day is to inform industry of the Federal Trade Commission's Consent Order regarding ULA and  the role of the Compliance Officer to oversee compliance with the Consent Order.   The Order is intended to ensure that ULA affords all satellite manufacturers non- discriminatory treatment for launch services and that Lockheed and Boeing, as satellite  manufacturers, consider all qualified launch vehicle providers on a non-discriminatory  basis.  The order also requires firewalls to prevent information from a satellite or other  launch vehicle provider from being shared by ULA with its Boeing or Lockheed Martin  parent.  The role of the Compliance Officer is to oversee compliance with the Consent  Order by all three respondents and to investigate any complaint or representation arising  in relation to or connected with compliance of this order.  DATE:  The United Launch Alliance Industry Day will be on April 5, 2007.  Attendance to the ULA Industry Day is limited to two (2) representatives per organization.  It is required that all attendees register online (http://www.aero.org/conferences/ula).   ADDRESS:  The meeting location is at The Aerospace Corporation located at 2350 East El Segundo Boulevard, Building A8 Conference Room, El Segundo, California   NSSO welcomes the attendance from members of the general public, but for security  reasons all attendees must be United States citizens with a valid photo identification for admission into The Aerospace Corporation facility. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Alan L. Adams, 310-336-7476 or  DeeDee Madrid, 310-336-7256 or Douglas Brown, 310-416-7704.   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  The Director of National Security Space Office,  Office of the Under Secretary to the Air Force, United States Air Force was appointed as  the Compliance Officer for Department of Defense in keeping with a decree issued by the  United States District court, District of Colombia.  The Anti-Trust Division of the  Department of Justice brought suit against Northrop-Grumman Corporation to prevent  their merger with TRW, Incorporated because it would substantially reduce competition  in production of certain satellites.  However, the merger was permitted with the  agreement that Northrop-Grumman Corporation would comply with certain prescribed  behaviors decreed in the Final Judgment.  The Compliance Division was established  within NSSO to monitor the Northrop-Grumman Corporation's compliance with the  Final Judgment on behalf of the Director, who has contracted with the Aerospace  Corporation for much of the administrative support.

<SUBJECT>MARINE CORPS INFANTRY COMBAT BOOT CERTIFICATION PROGRAM
<DESC>The purpose of this Special Notice is to establish the procedures for certification/recertification of manufacturers for the Hot Weather and Temperate Weather Infantry Combat Boot.  Upon being certified, your company will have the opportunity to sell the certified product within the Marine Corps Exchanges.  THE CERTIFICATION DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOUR PRODUCT WILL BE SOLD IN THE EXCHANGE; the decision will be made by the Marine Corps Exchange. It is the manufacturer's responsibility to engage all contract talks with the Exchange.  This command will have NO INVOLVEMENT in this area. All current and future vendors will go through a two step process of testing; consisting of a technical evaluation and a Field User Evaluation (FUE).  All certification announcements will be posted on FEDBIZOPS. Phase 1-Technical Evaluation To begin the certification/recertification process, manufacturers will complete the Request for Certification utilizing the current Manufactures Application for Certification form.  This form can be obtained from the certification officer, Lisa Dishman, at PMICE at 703-432-3313.  Once the form is complete, submit it and the test results from a certified testing facility identifying that the product has passed all testing requirements based on the Purchase Description (CR-PD 06-31 temperate weather and CR-PD 06-32 hot weather) for each type of boot.  All purchase descriptions can be obtained via this office.  The cost of the initial lab testing will be the responsibility of the manufacturer.  PM ICE will then review the test results and notify the manufacturer in writing that they have been approved/disapproved to participate in the Certification Program.  The manufacturer will have 10 days from the date of the notification letter to submit 6 samples, 3 of each size (12R ma!  le and 8R female) to PM ICE for Phase 1 testing.  Time line for certification will be opened from 1 March to 1 September.  Product received after 1 September will not be considered for certification until 1 March of the following year.  Phase 1- Technical Evaluation-Part 2 PM ICE will conduct a visual inspection and follow on lab testing at DSCP on each of the 6 samples.  All testing will be based on the Purchase Description for each type of boot.  Once the product has passed the visual inspection and lab testing, the manufacturer will be notified in writing that they have successfully completed Phase 1 of the certification process and may now proceed to Phase 2.  If the manufacturers product fails in any of the two areas of Phase 1 testing, a notification letter will be issued identifying all failures within Phase 1.  This will count as the first attempt, with one attempt at certification remaining. Phase 2- Field User Evaluation (FUE) The manufacturer will have 30 days to submit 50 pairs of boots in the identified size range for Phase 2 testing (8-12.5 male sizes only to include regular and wide sizes) with the cost being the responsibility of the manufacture.  Manufacturer provided boots will be field tested to define their respective product utility within units for controlled testing up to 90 days.  Size breakdown provided below.   Size breakdown: 8R-2 9R-3 9.5R-6 9.5W-2 10R-7 10.5R-10 10.5W-2 11.0R-10 11.5R-4 12.R-3 12.5R-1 The FUE will be used to quantitatively identify user validation of the boots material characteristics and provide user-based information on product performance, durability, and functionality in an operational environment.  PM ICE will not accept the FUE boots until the successful completion of Phase 1.  The FUE will define user acceptance in the following areas:   a.	Fit b.	Comfort c.	Durability of all components in a variety of         environments d.	Breath ability e.	Regulation of foot temperature and moisture f.	Resistance to sole delimitation  g.	Biomechanical design resistance to lower leg         injuries h.	Overall User Acceptance Marines participating in the FUE will complete a survey and a FUE report will be compiled.  Manufactures must achieve an 80% acceptance in each category to be certified.  Manufacturers will be notified in writing as to the test results noting the deficiencies and subsequent certification decision.  If certification is awarded, the certification will be valid for two years from the certification date at which time recertification will be required.  PM ICE reserves the right to revoke any certification based off of quality deficiencies identified throughout the Marine Corps. In order to reduce man hours and cost involved in testing for all parties, each manufacture will be authorized to submit for certification twice within a calendar year to include failures.  If the manufacture does not pass on the second attempt, they will be prohibited from participating in the Marine Corps certification program for two years on that particular item. PM ICE reserves the right at any time to make any modifications, updates or suspend the certification in regards to the best interest of the Marine Corps.  All current manufacturer's certifications are valid until their expiration date per PM ICE.  The projected date to re-open the certification process is March 1, 2007.  All documentation and boots are to be mailed to the address below: CG MARCORSYSCOM ATTN:  PM ICE/CESS (Todd Towles) 2200 Lester Street Quantico, VA  22134-6050 The point of contact for certification/recertification is Todd Towles, COML: (703) 432-3303, Cell: (703) 675-9545; email: todd.towles.ctr@usmc.mil.

STATEMENT

The Physical and Chemical Properties Division, Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC) has a need for the implementation of data quality assessment (DQA) procedures for the captured data through compilation of the SOURCE Database and application of ThermoData Engine software developed and maintained by the TRC of the NIST in Boulder, Colorado.  Development of DQA algorithms and implementation of volumetric properties of pure components in the SOURCE Database, also developed and maintained by NIST/TRC.  General skills involve software-based data collection operation management skills combined with extensive experience in experimental chemical thermodynamics, thermophysics, chemistry and chemical engineering, including theoretical interpretation and error propagation analysis.  Specialized skills include demonstrated familiarity with the TRC data systems and, in particular, TRC SOURCE data system.  SOURCE data system is a major relational archival system developed and maintained by TRC to store ?raw? experimental data for thermophysical, thermochemical and transport properties of pure compounds, binary and ternary systems as well as chemical reactions.  SOURCE data system is also a powerful tool to produce various compilations and critical evaluations of data in both hard-copy and electronic forms.  This work targets further enhancement of NIST/TRC SOURCE database, which serves as the foundation for ThermoData Engine (TDE) software developed by TRC, which implements the concept of dynamic data evaluation to provide on-demand recommended thermophysical and thermochemical property data for binary mixtures.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

FY 2007 HAZARDOUS CATEGORIZATION COURSE

Need to find out the interested /available instructors to teach our upcoming course for the Strike Teams. 

Instructor Requirements:
We are looking for the same instructors to travel to each location and give the training once per year . The dates of courses will be arranged at a later date. The following are the locations set aside for the courses to be held:

Novato, CA (Pacific Strike Team)
Mobile, AL (Gulf Strike Team)
Fort Dix, NJ (Atlantic Strike Team)

Each course will have a maximum of 30 students and must be co-instructed by two separate instructors. Course material must meet the scope of work described below and instructor must provide one HazCat? ID kit per three students to ensure maximum hands-on experience for students.

The bid must include the names and contact information for each instructor and the cost breakdown for both instructors, to include travel to all three locations, car rental, per diem, instructional fee, and any other expenses.

Bid should be broken down by base year, then four (4) 1-Year Options.

The following is the scope of work required for the course:

Operational training and preventive maintenance on the equipment, tools, and software included in the HazTech Systems?, Inc. HazCat? kit. As well as familiarization with the HazCat? WMD and Anthrax kits.

Course should include hands-on utilization of the HazCat? liquid and solid flow charts in identifying some of the most commonly spilled hazardous and non-hazardous materials which might be encountered in the field. During hands-on activities, students should be able to identify and classify several unknown materials (at least one from every DOT category), as well as introduce toxicology information and common uses of materials encountered.

Students should also be able to determine and understand the differences between organic and inorganic chemistry. Utilizing the HazCat? kit, they should be able to determine how to quickly identify compounds. Students should also be able to understand the chemical characteristics of organics, learning to use certain properties such as viscosity, water solubility, iodine crystal colors, and combustibility to identify the carbon skeletons and functional groups of organic unknowns. Examples of such unknown materials (organic/inorganic) to be identified are:

 
-	Paint Pigments
-	Plating Chemicals
-	Toxic Industrial Chemicals
-	Oxidizers
-	Salts
-	Flammable Liquids
-	Chlorinated solvents
-	Organic Peroxides
-	Automotive Products

Please see full RFP at http://philippines.usaid.gov.

In general, the Prime Contractor will be responsible for the construction in Mindanao of Barangay (village-level) Infrastructure Projects (BIPS) with construction costs between $5,000 and $50,000 and Regional Impact Projects (RIPS) with construction costs exceeding $50,000 up to $4,000,000.  Local sources that are physically located in the Philippines and authorized (i.e. registered and licensed) to do construction work in the Philippines will be contracted by the prime contractor to perform the construction work specified in this solicitation.  Project design work for BIPS is expected to be carried out internally by the Prime?s staff. Except in rate circumstances, project design work for RIPS is expected to be subcontracted to local architect-engineering (A&E) firms.  The prime contractor will assure the design and construction of the infrastructure projects.  To successfully carry out the requirements of the Scope of Work besides construction management services, the Prime Contractor shall be responsible for business development, workforce preparation, governance and support activities.     

It is anticipated a five-year, Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee (CPFF) completion-type prime contract will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.

Revealing the budgetary magnitudes for the contract and option does not mean that offerors should necessarily strive to meet the maximum amounts.  The most cost effective approach for achieving the results is encouraged and award will be made to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government considering technical and cost factors (see Section M of this solicitation).    

This Solicitation is being issued for full and open competition, under which any type organization, large or small commercial (for profit) firms, educational institutions, non-profit organizations, are eligible to compete. All participating organizations involved in providing/performing the required services as a prime contractor, must be of USAID Geographic Code 000 (United States) nationality. For subcontractors, the authorized geographic code is the Host Country and Geographic Code 000 pursuant to the requirements of 22 CFR 228.

USAID encourages participation to the maximum extent possible of small business concerns, including small disadvantaged and women-owned concerns in this project as the prime contractor or in the role of a subcontractor in accordance with FAR Part 19.  Also if the offeror (Prime Contractor) is not a small business, small disadvantaged or women-owned small business, a subcontracting plan must be submitted as part of the offeror?s cost proposal.  

The competitive proposal method of solicitation, as set forth in FAR Part 15 will be used for this procurement.  The RFP contains clauses incorporated by reference.  The full text of the FAR clauses is available on the internet at http://www.arnet.gov/far/.

The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions or the submittal of final proposed revisions, based upon evaluation of the offeror?s submitted technical and cost information.  Accordingly the offeror?s initial offer should contain its best terms from both a cost/price and technical standpoint.


Offerors are advised that funds are not yet available for a contract award and final approval of the Mission?s Operational Plan by the Head of the Agency is required prior to an obligation of funds under any contract resulting from this solicitation.

This solicitation in no way obligates USAID to award a contract nor does it commit USAID to pay any costs incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal. 


Sincerely,
Raymond L. Edler
Supervisory Regional Contracting Officer

BASIS FOR AWARD:  This procurement is being solicited, offered, evaluated, and awarded using simplified acquisition procedures.  The OCC will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible hotel (FAR Subpart 9.104) whose quote will be the most advantageous to the OCC using the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  

1.	Suitability encompasses the factors that contribute to the overall success of the conference and to the conference attendee's convenience, comfort and safety at the hotel.  Evaluation of suitability will be a subjective assessment of the features and services offered by the hotel and of other relevant facts and circumstances that are obtained by OCC from any source.  The suitability assessment will focus on, but not be limited to, the location of the hotel, the condition of the hotel facility (new, old, remodeled); condition of the guest rooms (designated non-smoking rooms; soft goods clean and in good condition, etc.); condition of the meeting rooms (size and shape, obstructions such as pillars, soundproofing, security, proximity of rooms to each other, etc.); hotel services; availability of on-premise outlets, such as restaurants, convenience store and fitness facility; proximity of the Metro to the hotel.  The OCC may base its rating solely on the information provided in the quote or, at OCC's option, also on the findings gathered during a SITE VISIT.  
 

2.	Past performance is considered to be the hotel?s relevant work history and the OCC's assessment, with respect to such work history, of how well the hotel performed.  Especially relevant are a hotel's record of conforming to contract requirements; a hotel's commitment to customer satisfaction; and, generally, a hotel's reputation for demonstrating a business-like concern for the interests of its customers.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on OCC's experience, if any, with the hotel; the experience of references submitted by the hotel; and a consideration of other relevant facts and circumstances that are obtained by OCC from any source.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.   

3.	Price.  Price is the total evaluated cost of a quote.  OCC will base total evaluated cost on the prices quoted for guest rooms, meeting rooms, food and beverages, and audio visual equipment.  OCC will not consider prices that are contingent, unreasonable or unbalanced.  OCC will use total evaluated cost as part of its best value analysis.

OCC anticipates awarding the contract in late April/early May 2007.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a  Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for NASA Glenn Research Center that is charged with developing the Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system for the Upper-Stage of the new ARES I launch vehicle.  As part of this program we will be building a hydraulics breadboard system to evaluate the TVC hydraulic system components.  A motor driven hydraulic pump is one of the TVC hydraulic system components that will be under evaluation during this breadboard testing. The overall goal of the breadboard testing is to evaluate the functionality of each hydraulic system component (both steady state and dynamic), determine if each hydraulic component is adequately sized, and to see how all the hydraulic components operate when integrated into a complete TVC system. GRC will also use TVC hydraulic breadboard testing to help characterize the motor/pump performance under varying operating conditions. GRC may also test out different types of motor/pumps including AC Induction, BLDC and BDC motor/pumps in order to help determine the most appropriate motor type for our application. The circulation motor/pump has two primary functions in the TVC hydraulic system.  1.	The primary function of the circulation motor/pump in the flight design will be to thermally condition the hydraulic fluid after cryogenics have been loaded on the vehicle (vehicle will be on the pad during this operation). Due to close proximity of various hydraulic system components to the cryogenic tanks, it is anticipated that the hydraulic oil will require some level of thermal conditioning (heating) prior to launch. This may require the motor/pump to operate in a cyclic on-off type of operational mode.  2.	In addition to the thermal conditioning function, the circulation motor/pump will also be used to hold the J2-X engine in the null position during the boost ascent portion (~ 135 seconds) of the vehicle flight profile. This will require the circulation motor/pump to provide a small steady amount of system leakage flow continuously at rated system pressure during this mode of operation. Motor/Pump requirements for TVC breadboard Test The general requirements applicable to the entire motor/pump assembly will be listed first followed by requirements that are specific to either the pump or the motor. General Motor/Pump Assembly Requirements: 1.	Motor/Pump Hardware Condition: Motor/pump assembly can either be a new motor/pump assembly or a re-furbished motor/pump assembly. 2.	Fluid Medium: The motor/pump shall be designed to operate with hydraulic fluid conforming to MIL-PRF-83282. If motor/pump is not designed for this fluid type then contractor shall note non-conformance. In addition, contractor shall inform NASA of the additional cost/schedule required for modifying motor/pump design to be compatible with MIL-PRF-83282 which will be subject to NASA concurrence/approval. 3.	Design:  Motor/pump shall be a fully integrated design (motor/pump is one complete package and requires no additional integration of the motor & pump by NASA GRC). 4.	Cooling Requirement: Motor/pump may be either liquid cooled (using system hydraulic working fluid) or air cooled. The method of motor/pump cooling shall be integrated into the overall motor/pump assembly. a.	If air cooled, motor/pump shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the performance requirements outlined in this document while operating in an air temperature range of 60 F to 80 F. b.	If liquid cooled, motor/pump shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the performance requirements outlined in this document while operating with hydraulic fluid that has a temperature range of -40 F to +250 F (system maximum temperature). In addition, the circulation motor/pump shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the performance requirements outlined in this document while operating with a maximum pump hydraulic fluid inlet temperature of 225 F. c.	NASA GRC would also like to have vendor give input on the type of cooling that will likely be required for eventual motor/pump flight design. NASA GRC can send vendor estimated duty cycle of motor/pump as well as other pertinent information environmental type of information if required. 5.	Interface Requirements: Contractor shall provide NASA with motor/pump interface requirements for hydraulics, electrical and for mounting of motor/pump. All interface information shall be sent to NASA GRC for concurrence/approval. a.	Electrical Connections: Industry standard electrical connections such as MIL-C-5015, MIL-DTL-38999 or equivalent are preferred. All electrical connection information shall be sent to NASA GRC for concurrence/approval. b.	Fluid Connections: SAE straight threads per MS33649 or equivalent are preferred. All fluid connection information shall be sent to NASA GRC for concurrence/approval c.	Mounting: Mounting provisions shall be supplied for motor/pump. If isolation mounts are recommended for operation then vendor shall either (1) supply vibration isolation mounts with motor/pump assembly or (2) provide required information to NASA GRC so that NASA GRC can procure vibration isolation mounts 6.	Fluid Temperature: The motor/pump shall be designed to operate within a hydraulic fluid temperature range of -40 F to +250 F in the hydraulic system. a.	The circulation motor/pump shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the performance requirements outlined in this document while operating with a maximum pump hydraulic fluid inlet temperature of 225 F. 7.	Duty Cycle/Modes of Operation: As mentioned in the synopsis, it is anticipated that the motor/pump will be required to operate in two different modes: (1) cyclic on/off mode to thermally condition the hydraulic fluid while the launch vehicle is on the pad and (2) continuous mode to hold the J-2X engine in null position during boost ascent (~ 135 seconds). Therefore, the BB motor/pump shall be capable of being cycled on/off. The number of times that the BB motor/pump will need to be cycled on/off is TBD.  The estimated minimum/maximum duration/duty cycle that the BB motor/pump will need to operate in this cyclic mode is as follows: a.	Minimum duration of cyclic mode of operation: ~ 2.5 hours @ 50 % duty cycle b.	Maximum duration of cyclic mode of operation: TBD 8.

The Government will evaluate this information, and determine which offer represents the best value to the Government.  Past performance (both corporate an d with respect to specific individuals identified), technical competence, and price will be taken into consideration in the evaluation.  The Government intends to incorporate the successful offerors quarterly maintenance plan into the resultant contract.
