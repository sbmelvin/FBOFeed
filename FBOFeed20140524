Failure to pick-up or to deliver a patient within (30) minutes of the allowed times shall result in a payment deduction of one-fourth (1/4) of the applicable charges for the trip for each thirty minutes the contractor is late.

If the pick-up is other than at the VA Medical Center (VAMC), the Contractor shall call the Travel Clerk during regular working hours and the Medical Administrative Assistant after regular working hours as soon as he anticipates that a delay may develop for which he expects to claim reimbursement.

4.	NOTES
HIPAA COMPLIANCE: HIPAA compliance is required. The Contractor must adhere to the provisions of Public Law 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and the National Standards to Protect the Privacy and Security of Protected Health Information (PHI). As required by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has promulgated rules governing the security and use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In accordance with HIPAA, the Contractor may be required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with VA. VACO has recognized transportation service as an entity that does not require a BAA with their contractors as long as they are conducting health care on behalf of the VA - ground transportation program qualified as a medical service - therefore, no BAA is required.
