<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the upgrade to an existing NASA Langley Research Center owned Coherent diode pumped, single frequency, frequency doubled Nd:YVO4 YAG Laser from 5 Watts to 10 Watts. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from  Coherent, Inc., as the only known source who can meet Agency requirements.  Coherent, Inc., holds the patent on single-mode continuous-wave YAG lasers.  This laser will be an upgraded to a custom-desinged LITA system currently in use at LaRC.  Purchasing this laser from any other manufacturer would involve substantial duplicaion of costs that would not be recovered through competition.  It would require the redesign of the LITA system to accommodate a laser from a different manufacturer.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 26, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

SELECTION CRITERIA: The Corps of Engineers New England District will use both primary and secondary selection criteria.  The secondary selection criteria will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are essentially technically equal.         (1) Primary Selection Criteria:  The Primary Selection Criteria (a-f  below) are listed in descending order of importance. a. The firm must have on its staff or provide through a consultant, professional engineers with demonstrated expertise in all  those disciplines listed above.  The firm must also have staff or provide through a consultant, personnel with professional registration in all thirteen North Atlantic Division states: ME, NH, VT, MA, CT, RI, NY, NJ, PA, MD, DL, WV, VA and the District of  Columbia.  Firms not demonstrating these requirements will be disqualified from further consideration.  b. The firm must have the capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  c. The firm must possess a good record of past performance on contract s with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  d.  Firms must demonstrate previous experience in preparing construction cost estimates with Micro Computer Aided Cost Estimating System (MCACES) and Life Cycle Co st Analysis methodology.  The firm shall also demonstrate experience in the development of construction contingencies based upon the knowledge of Risk Analysis and level of design detail. e. Firms should have capability to provide all deliverables in Micro Station V7 DGN format.  The Government will only accept this format, without conversion or reformatting, in the target CADD software format and on the target platform specified herein.  The target platform is a PC/Workstation with an Intel compatible centr al processing unit and a Windows 2000 operating system.  Advanced software application files used for civil design and drawings shall be delivered in formats compatible with INROADS(Bentley Civil Engineering).  All delivered CADD files shall be in complian ce with A/E/C CADD Standard Release 2.0.  f. Firms must demonstrate knowledge of preparing specifications for construction contracts using a personal computer based software package.  All specifications for Corps of Engineers (COE) contracts will be prepar ed using Guide Specifications and SPECSINTACT.    	(2) Secondary Selection Criteria: 	a. SB and SDB Participati on. The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU or MI is a prime cont ractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration 	b. Geographic Proximity. Proximity is simply the physical location of a firm in relation to the location of a project, and has very little to do with the technical ability of a firm to perform the project. Hence, proximity should normally only be used as a selection criterion for small or routine projects or ID contracts in support of a specific installation(s).  It will have very little bearing on this sel ection. 	c. Volume of DoD Contract Awards.  DoD A-E contract awards can be obtained from ACASS, and verified and updated during the interviews with the most highly qualified firms.  4. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit four copies of SF 255 (11/92 edition), and four copies of SF 254 (11/92 edition) to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, ATTN:  A-E Uni t, 696 Virginia Road, Concord MA  01742-2751.  Submissions are due not later than the close of business on the February 7, 2003.  Four copies of SF 254 are also required for each proposed consultant.  It should be noted that SF255s are not required for pro posed consultants.  Include ACASS number in Section 2b. of the SF255.  Call the ACASS Center at 503-808-4591 to obtain a number.  In Section 10 of the SF 255 describe the firm's overall design quality management plan, including management approach, coordin ation of disciplines and subcontractors, and quality control procedures that must include an independent technical review.  Solicitation packages are not provided.  This is not a request for proposal.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to award a sole source purchase order to Lynx Therapeutics, Inc., Hayward, CA 94545,  pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This procurement is for the purchase of 1) Generation of Megaclone Library and 2) Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) of 1 million signature tags.  NIEHS will submit two (2) samples to Lynx Therapeutics.  The work to be conducted is based on Lynx Therapeutics unique and proprietary cloning procedure called Megaclone.  This patented technology transforms a sample containing millions of DNA molecules into one made up of millions of micro-beads, each of which carries approx. 100,000 copies of one of the DNA molecules in the sample.  In contrast to conventional cloning, in which an individual DNA molecule is selected from a sample and amplified into many copies for analysis or identification, Lynx Therapeutics captures on one set of micro-beads, clones of nearly all the DNA sequences that characterize a sample.  Once the DNA is attached to the micro-beads, the clones can be handled and subjected to MPSS which generates simultaneously, from a million or more Megaclone micro-beads, sequence information that uniquely identifies a sample's DNA molecules.  This patented, proprietary technology enables many analyses or characterizations to be conducted.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of date of notice to Dee Lunney at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Lynx Therapeutics, Inc.  The NAICS Code/Size is 541690/$6.0M..  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.*****

<DESC>AFMETCAL Det 1 intends to award a purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures for the purchase of a One Year Subscription Service for Worldwide Standards and Vendor Data.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  This is a Request for Quotes  and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, F33660-03-Q-7000, is a request for a price quotation for a One Year Subscription Service for Worldwide Standards and Vendor Data.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 97-19.  FAR clauses 52-212-3 and FAR 52.212-5 apply to this acquisition.  The following clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference:  FAR 52-212-1, FAR 52-212-4.  Offers will be evaluated and AFMETCAL will require access to a website with a password to evaluate proposals.  This acquisition is UNRESTRICTED.  General Information:  Managing the large volume of technical information from internal and external sources is critical to the completion of AFMETCAL?s mission.  AFMETCAL requires a single comprehensive suite of information in electronic media to assist their engineers and technical professionals in making better, faster and more cost-effective decisions.  This online information is to consist of a collection of specifications, standards, and manufacturers? catalogs required to support research and procurement of items in the commercial environment.  Scope:  AFMETCAL requires a single primary source, which provides an array of technical and procurement data through electronic media. This is to support our calibration equipment purchase, calibration determination, and calibration technical order programs.   It is not our intention to purchase a collection of government web sites or links to other commercial web sites.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  Technical Aspects:  Must be compatible with the current AFMETCAL desktop workstations using Windows 2000 software.  The service is to include a comprehensive single access point that allows various types of searching and management reports, with the ability to identify specific documents then view and print the actual document pages via desktop workstations.  Security provided via usernames and passwords for systems with proprietary/sensitive data.  Document images scanned at 300X300 dpi. minimum.  Document images must be viewable in PDF (Adobe Acrobat) format or ASCII Text.  DODISS documents must be viewable/searchable as full-text with intradocument linkages and cut-and-paste capabilities to Notepad, Word Processors, etc.  Must be able to print individual pages, range of pages, or the complete document.  Must use the Internet, standard Web browsers, and the Adobe Acrobat image viewer to deliver the data, so no customized software installation or configuration is necessary to use the product.  The contractor must provide toll-free technical and application support.  The contractor must provide a minimum of 1 day on-site training on their services with the contract and on-site support as needed. Specifications and Standards Requirements:  Government Specifications and Standards: The service shall provide as a minimum access to the following document with access to both index and complete and unlimited access to full-text images in PDF and/or ASCII Text:  Military Specifications and Standards.  Performance & Detail Specifications.  USAF and NAF Standards.  Navy Technical Publications.  Federal Specifications and Standards.  Commercial Item Descriptions (CIDs).  Joint/Army-Navy Specifications and Standards.  Military/Federal Qualified Products Lists (QPLs).  Qualified Manufacturers Lists (QMLs).  Military Handbooks.  Military Bulletins.  MS Drawings.  AND, ANA, AN Drawings.  DESC/DSCC/SMD Drawings.  Data Item Descriptions (DIDs).  Federal Information Processing Standards.  Historical (cancelled and superseded) documents.  Historical documents will be evaluated based on the most complete offering via electronic access.  This is critical because of the age of equipment of supported equipment.   Note: ASCII Text to over 65,000 Military & Federal Specifications and Standards is critical to our ability to copy-and-paste portions of these documents into our sourcing materials.  This full-text ASCII provides easy copy-and-paste capabilities into any Word Processor software to expedite project documentation.  Many older documents are only scanned images and the ability to have access to ASCII Text versions has been determined to be a critical requirement when PDF normal is not available.  DoD Adopted commercial, non-government standards.  This section must provide direct access to images (HARDCOPY DELIVERY WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED ? SEE NOTE 1) to DoD Adopted documents from the following Standards Developing Organizations in electronic format:  AA, AATCC, ABMA, ACI, AGMA, AIAA, AIA/NAS, AIIM, ANSI, API, ARI, ASA, ASHRAE, ASME, ASQ, ASSE, ASTM, AWS, AWWA, BHMA, BOCA, CTI, EIA, IAS/AGA, ICEA, IEC, IEEE, IPC, ISO, ISA, MSS, NEMA, NFPA, (NFPA), NISO, NSF, PIA, RWMA, SAE, SMACNA, SSPC, UL.  Must include direct & unlimited access to Non-Government Standard?s images (HARD COPY DELIVERY WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED ? SEE NOTE 1) (not just DoD Adopted) with daily updating from the following Societies:  ANSI ? Mechanical Documents, ANSI ? Nuclear Documents, ANSI ? Miscellaneous Documents, ISO Quality/Safety/Measurement Documents, ASTM Test Methods Documents, ASME Documents, IEEE Documents, ISA Documents, ASQ Documents.  All non-government standards must be licensed by the issuing standards developing organization to allow unlimited image viewing and printing of the desired actual standard as needed.  Document images must include full English translation.  Documents must be updated daily.  System must be able to search based on revision date.  System must provide automatic update notification capabilities.  Documents must be provided via electronic media.  Delivery in hardcopy format that may delay work and reduce readiness will not be considered an acceptable alternative to electronic access to these documents (SEE NOTE 1).  Specifications and Standards Search Requirements: The system must allow the user to locate specific military information by the following methods:  All Military/DoD, Government, and Non-Government documents must be included in the same product using the same search engine.  The index must include not only Military/Government documents but also DoD adopted industry standards and industry standards.  Searching by document number or portion of a document number, including alpha prefixes and decimal points.  Keywords must be searchable from the index in the Title of the document, Scope/Intended Use/Keyword paragraphs and from the document outline for all documents that include this information.  Keyword searching of the full-text of DODISS documents from the index and the ability to copy-and-paste this information into any Word Processor.  This full-text ASCII provides easy copy-and-paste capabilities into any Word Processor software to expedite project documentation.  Searching by Federal Supply Class (FSC) and. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  Searching by Preparing Organization.  The product must have the capability to conduct a search by specific document type.  For example, search by Military Specifications, Federal Specifications, etc.  Combination or Boolean searching must be possible.  Each search query should provide the user with a Results List.  The Results List must identify the document number, active or historical status, publication date, the document title, and show the active and historical document list with links to those documents when available.  It must also provide links to QPLs and FLIS information when available to help expedite sourcing information and technical requirements.  Document Reports: The service must make available the following reports: A document summary that provides Scope and Intended use information for Government and DoD adopted standards.  Keywords assigned by the author of the document, for example see Document Summary for MIL-STD-1580A.  Additional management information such as applicable QPLs, DIDs, etc.  Links to QPL and FLIS data when applicable for DODISS documents.  An Applicable Documents report that lists all documents referenced within the document for Government and DoD Adopted standards.  Links to applicable documents.  Responsible Activities report that includes addresses, phone/fax numbers, and email addresses for the Preparing Activity, Custodians, Reviewers and the Society/Organization.  A history of the document to include the date of the base document as well as any revisions or amendments, with links to those documents.  A complete document outline that allows the user to go from the index directly to the paragraph, sub-paragraph, or section level rather than simply the first page of the document.  The report information must be printable.   OTE 1: Clarification regarding hardcopy delivery.  AFMETCAL has initiated many new initiatives to move to a paperless environment to improve our mission response time.  This is a result of decreased headcount and the need for better quality and compliance control of documents.  To that end, we cannot and will not consider hardcopy delivery as a replacement for electronic delivery when and if electronic delivery is available from a potential vendor.  We also understand that the management of maintaining, updating, and sharing individual hardcopy documents would not be practical and may lead to copyright infringements and non-compliance issues when using Non-Government Standards.  Manufacturers' Catalogs: Provide a catalog service that allows simple, full-text searching on manufacturers? catalogs.  The database must be searched by any combination of the following fields:  Keyword, Part Number (which can include any numeric searches; e.g., part number, referenced document number, NIIN, NSN, etc.), Manufacturer Name (includes old names, alternate names or GSA contractor number). Both PDF and non-PDF documents are searchable and accessible in this database.  The database must allow searching for manufacturers catalogs by any of the following: Street Address, City, State, Zip/Postal Code, Country, Telephone #, Fax #, SIC Code, NAICS Code, CAGE Code with a result of the actual vendors catalog or data sheet.  The results list from any search must produce a single list of results with the ability to view manufactures information and/or full-text catalogs from that results page.  It is also critical that the service sorts the results based on best match to the search criteria with the best matches appearing first.  The service must provide the ability to locate products by industry or military standard, such as ASTM A276 or MIL-STD-1290.  It must also provide the ability to combine the search for a product by industry or military standard, keyword, and /or manufacturer such as MIL-STD-1290 and fuel valve.   Access to a service containing commercial and military parts is required and the service must include full-text database to both commercial vendor and GSA information.  It must contain full-text document pages of supplier catalogs, data sheets, and related documents, and contains GSA supply schedules, contractor information, and related publications.  All COTS or government-approved sources for items and information can be searched, viewed, and printed using the same product and the same search engine.  Access to partial catalog information, URL links to the vendor?s web page or on-line catalog information is not acceptable.  The service must include an automatic word thesaurus to link related terms, enabling technical and procurement personnel to search for a part using familiar language.  A category filtering option allows results to be displayed across the entire database or by subject area or industry (e.g., Materials, Marine, Aerospace, GSA).  This allows for targeted results, saving valuable research time.  The user must be able to find manufacturer or distributor information for the item searched.  This information is to include manufacturer listings for all vendors and distributors with catalogs in the database.  These listings contain addresses, sales office listings, contact information, NAICS/SIC/CAGE codes and URL links to manufacturer's websites where available.  As of 1 Oct 1997, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database as a condition of award.  Quotes should be directed to Carol Zigan, Contract Specialist, at AFMETCAL Det 1, 813 Irving-Wick Dr W., Bldg 2, Heath OH  43056-6116.  PHONE 740-788-5042, FAX 740-788-5157.  E-Mail carol.zigan@afmetcal.af.mil.  Offers are due no later than 4:00 P.M. E.D.T. on 31 Oct 2002.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.

******************************************************************************            

Request for Construction Documents 
Solicitation GS-04P-03-CXC-0020


DOCUMENT SECURITY NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS:  

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors. 


Note: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients. 

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor's license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov/, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.


3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) seeks to increase the hours under Option Years Two through Four with Innerbase Technologies, Inc. under their existing contract PBGC01-CT-01-0603 for Database and Unix Administration Services.  The additional labor hours are necessary to provide support for large pension plans received by PBGC which require increased Database Administration support, analysis, troubleshooting and maintenance. Also support to assist with Oracle 9i migration, enterprise-wide systems integration into a Corporate data interface and use of the Oracle 9i Application Server.  It is in the best interest of the PBGC for the current provider to complete this work by increasing the labor hours under the existing contract.  This increase under the existing contract will ensure continuity in the work.  This is not a request for proposal.

<SUBJECT>14--EXTENDED RANGE ACTIVE MISSILE (ERAM)!!

<CONTACT>David J. Hance 202-781-2881 Contracting Officer Mr. Thomas A. Duval , 202-781-4966
<DESC>17. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to award a contract or contracts to develop, design, test, produce and support (including spares) an Extended Range Active Missile (ERAM) to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS), PO Box 11337, Tucson, AZ  85734-1337.  ERAM will be the Surface Navy's anti-air warfare (AAW) missile combining extended range and active seeker capability.  RMS will be required to meet an ERAM initial operational capability (IOC) of Fiscal Year 2010 (FY10) or earlier.  The contract(s) will be awarded using other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  RMS is the only source that can satisfy both the extended range and active seeker requirements associated with a ship-launched ERAM by FY10.  Furthermore, award to any other source would likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not exp ected to be recovered through competition.  Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact RMS directly.  See Numbered Note(s):  22*****!!

<DESC>Proposal Submission Place: Mr. Chi Jianguo, Shanghai Water Services and Assets Operation and Development Co., Ltd. (SWAOD), 23/F Shanghai Overseas Chinese Mansion, 129 Yan An Xi Road, Shanghai 200040, P.R. China, Tel: (86-21) 6249-2000, Fax: (86-21) 6249-3000. 
POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Shanghai Infrastructure Finance Advisory Services Project. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and assist Shanghai Water Services Assets Operation and Development Co., Ltd. (SWAOD) in developing a business plan, an investment strategy and a bond issuance program for the Shanghai Urban Environment Project (SHUEP).

Over the past ten years, Shanghai has experienced extremely rapid economic growth. During the next decade, the city intends to expend major efforts to improve the environment.  There is a need for China to commit to wide ranging economic, environmental, and political priorities, including local government authority to develop and implement environmental projects and to eventually borrow through corporate bond markets that can channel funding needs into the environmental sector.

Shanghai officials estimate that over the next five years they will have to finance a minimum of RMB 40 billion (US$4.85 billion) in the water and wastewater sector alone.  Both national and Shanghai municipal policy call for strictly limiting the amount of capital investment financed from the municipal budget in the form of contributed equity.  Funding from this source is estimated at only RMB 6 billion (US$732 million).  Multi-lateral and international donor agencies will provide loan funds to cover a small part of the remaining financing gap.  However, the great bulk of financing will have to be raised from domestic non-state sources or the international private capital market.

In broad terms, Shanghai is committed to raising non-state capital financing for the environmental sector through four basic strategies.  Each of these strategies seeks to generate longer-term financing.  The strategies include: 1) attracting equity investments, from both domestic and international investors, to finance new capital projects like wastewater treatment plants and water supply systems; 2) generating new capital to help finance new environmental projects through the sale of existing assets in the environmental sector; 3) borrowing from domestic commercial and development banks with the maturity of bank loans likely to be extended considerably; and 4) accessing the domestic capital market directly through the issuance of longer-term bonds.  All of these financing options will be pursued by Shanghai during the SHUEP and are consistent with SHUEP policy objectives.  The magnitude of financing that has to be raised makes it necessary to pursue all possible avenues of efficient access to financial markets.

The development of a new enterprise/corporate bond will help finance a significant part of Shanghai's capital budget.  Since financing in sufficient amounts is highly unlikely to be available from other sources, the use of the bonds for wastewater collection and treatment facilities and solid waste management facilities will be critical to improving environmental conditions in the heavily polluted city.  The program could also stimulate fundamental financial reforms in the municipal sector of China as a whole.  The bond issues could serve as a model for future bond financings by local government enterprises in other metropolitan regions to help finance environmental investment in a sustainable manner as well as to finance other types of investment.  

SWAOD seeks to hire a Contractor to develop a technical assistance for assistance in preparing a business plan, a debt management strategy, a capital investment program, an APL Bond Issuance program, as well as identifying policy issues in the financial development sector of China.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $498,500 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, local time, February 24, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Aerial Targets Systems Program Office, Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB, Florida, plans to award a sole-source contract for logistics support, subsystem components, spares, and engineering support for USAF AN/DPQ-9 Vector Doppler Scorer (VDOPS) Systems.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this contract with Cartwright Electronics, 655 West Valencia Drive, Fullerton, CA 92832 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  VDOPS air-to-air missile scoring systems are installed on USAF QF-4, BQM-34, MQM-107, and AFSAT aerial targets.  The overall VDOPS system, to include its logistics support, must meet the performance requirements specified below and must be compatible with the existing VDOPS system operational infrastructure in place at Tyndall AFB, FL and Holloman AFB, NM.  This contract is for field and depot level logistics support, hardware production for subsystems components and spare parts, and related engineering services.  Options will include spare parts for VDOPS systems currently installed on QF-4, BQM-34, and MQM-107 aerial targets, airborne systems and target installation kits, ground station spares, test equipment, and time and materials for hardware and software engineering support; and future spare parts for AFSAT.  The total contact value including options is estimated to be less than $6.0 Million.  The period of performance is planned to be a one year basic contract with 4 option years.  The AN-DPQ-9 VDOPS systems currently installed are logistically supported, operated and sustained by Cartwright Electronics (CE) through an existing contract.  The AN/DPQ-9 VDOPS is a CE proprietary system and was originally contracted as a competitive procurement awarded in February 1995.  The government does not own a technical data package for reprocurement.  After contract award, there will not be sufficient time available for a potential offeror to become trained without serious impact to user support.  The basic requirement of the VDOPS system is to provide the capability to reconstruct the time-tagged history of a missile trajectory.  The trajectory description must include the vector position of the missile relative to the aerial target with data collection whenever the missile is within 100 feet of the target.  The overall system performance and technical requirements in general include the following:  range compatible (telemetry and sensor frequency, etc.) with Tyndall AFB, Eglin AFB, and White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) range complexes; non-cooperative (no scoring system components in the missile) RF scoring technology; 100 percent spherical coverage; position accuracy within 2.0 feet or 8 percent of range to 100 feet (whichever is greater); 600 to 6500 feet per second relative velocity (Target to missile); velocity accuracy within <1% of missile velocity; missile attitude accuracy of 5 degrees at 0 to 50 feet range and 10 degrees from 50 to 100 feet range; ability to score non-linear trajectories; active scoring on 2 targets in formation (200 feet minimum separation); quick look report of scalar point of closest approach and vector score within 2 hours processing time; and target integration on the QF-4, BQM-34, MQM-107D/E and AFSAT.  The program office plans to award the VDOPS contract effective 1 September 2003.  The anticipated contract type is Firm Fixed Price/Time and Material.  Interested firms should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) within 30 days of this announcement.  Responding firms must have a secret level security clearance and must be export control certified in accordance with DOD 5230.25.  Export control certification may be obtained through the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Battle Creek, MI, 49016-3412, telephone 1-800-352-3572.  Submit the SOC and export control certification to Ms. Judy Bruscino, AAC/WMRAK, 102 West D Avenue, Suite 373, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6808.  The SOC should include and briefly describe plant, professional, and manufacturing resources; knowledge of the technologies involved; experience with the AN/DPQ-9 non-cooperative vector scoring system to include airborne systems, VDOPS ground station, test equipment, and air-to-air missile scoring; experience with related field and depot levels logistic support; what aerial targets the firm has supported; delivery lead time for AN/DPQ-9 VDOPS components; and recommended government furnished equipment.  This is not a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Respondents to this notice will not be notified of evaluation results.  After the SOCs have been screened, the final solicitation will be issued to those prospective sources that, in the sole judgment of the purchasing activity, have the capability to successfully fill the program requirements.  Interested sources should contact Ms. Judy Bruscino, Contracts Specialist, AAC/WMRAK, 102 West D Avenue, Suite 373, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6808, by phone (850) 882-9307, extension 5179, or fax (850) 882-7950 (must call to confirm receipt).

The purpose of the THOR Industry Day and Phase I Technology Review is to update industry and academia with the technology developments of the THOR program and allow discussions for Phase II initiation. The first amendment to the AFRL Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 02-08-SNK, focusing on THOR Phase 2, is planned to be released prior to the THOR Industry Day and Phase I Technology Review Meeting.   Information contained in the BAA announcement takes precedence over any information obtained from the Industry Day or any other sources.

This THOR Industry Day and Phase I Technology Review is intended to provide potential sources with advanced information that may be useful in preparing proposals for the AFRL BAA 02-08-SNK amendment.  The THOR initiative is developing mobile free-space optical hardware, system and networking technologies, and system concepts that extend the reach of the Global Information Grid (GIG). The program goal is an affordable link of terminals with an order of magnitude reduction in size, weight, and power over current available technologies.  This effort requires the involvement of a wide variety of government joint and service laboratories and commercial technology development centers.  AFRL BAA 02-08-SNK contains the list of enabling technologies that may be applicable to this project plus an overview of the THOR program phases.  A web site has been established at http://www.schafercorp-ballston.com/thor2003/ that  provides registration information, agenda, and information  to be presented during the THOR Industry Day and  Phase I Technology Review.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>M -- A76 ROLLER RECOVERY AND INK MANUFACTURING
<SOLNBR>BEP-03-0021
<RESPDATE>121302
<CONTACT>Robert Knauer, Contracting Officer, Phone (202)874-5827, Fax (202)874-3135, Email Robert.Knauer@bep.treas.gov
<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is issuing this NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT for an A-76 study being performed at our Washington, DC and Fort Worth, Texas locations. In response to the announced Commercial Activity study of 30 positions covering Ink Making and Roller Recovery, this action will comply with the ?current? procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, the "Commercial Activities" program. Services involved are described below for each functional element. A cost comparison will be performed later in the calendar year to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the ink making and roller recovery services performed by Government.  Therefore, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is seeking vendors nationwide that have the capability, background, skilled personnel, past experience and resources to provide the Bureau with two distinct functions:Ink Manufacturing and Roller Recovery operations.  

Ink Manufacturing is located at two geographic locations (Washington, DC and Fort Worth, TX).  The Washington and Fort Worth facilities both produce a variety of different inks each year for use in the production of U.S. currency.  The inks produced are 1) intaglio inks used on intaglio printing presses and 2) high security inks for use on letterpress presses (Washington DC only).  The equipment used to produce the different types of inks includes automated batching systems for weighing ink ingredients, industrial mixers of varying capacities and high-pressure three-roll mills for complete dispersion of raw materials.  Since the quality of the inks produced at the Bureau is very critical, a testing lab performs certification tests on all ink batches produced and Inks must pass the tests before they can be used.  In addition to regular ink production, the Ink Manufacturing Section also provides technical support for the development of new and experimental inks. (NOTE:  The ink chemists and technical support staff who do ink development are NOT currently included in the number of positions subject to our A-76 analysis, since they are members of the Office of Technical Support and not the Office of Production Support as are the ink makers.)

Roller Recovery Section Operation: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing?s Roller Recovery Section produces wiper rolls and inking-in rolls for the cylinder wipe, intaglio printing presses used to print U.S. currency. To fabricate a wiper roll, three distinct layers (different formulations and physical properties) of PVC (polyvinylchloride) material are applied to a steel wiper roll core using special application and curing procedures. First,  raw materials are mixed together to make the various formulations of PVC coatings.  Then, the PVC is applied to the roll.  Following application of the PVC layers, the wiper roll surfaces are finished and polished in a lathe to obtain specific dimensions and surface finish.  To produce a wiper roll that meets the physical requirements of operating on high-speed currency presses, the Roller Recovery Section closely monitors the quality of both incoming raw materials and the PVC formulations of the respective wiper roll layers. Operation of the PVC coating machines and the mechanical soundness and condition of wiper roll cores are also monitored very closely.  When completed, all wiper rolls undergo a series of final quality inspections to assess the bonding of PVC layers, hardness and surface defects.  In addition to regular wiper roll production, the Roller Recovery Section also provides technical support for the development of experimental rolls needed for new inks and currency design features.    

ACTION REQUIRED: It is requested that any vendor in the United States having the skilled personnel, talent, capability, resources and past experience to provide the above service and operation of these functions provide by email the following information to the point of contract indicated in this notice, Mr. ROBERT KNAUER.  Please provide:

1. Name of Company Contract
2. Phone and Fax numbers
3. Email addresses
4. Company Website address
5. At least two to three (2-3) commercial and government references that can verify that your firm has done the type of work contemplated and that provides information about the quality of your past performance. Include the following information for each contract:

1. Name of Contracting Activity or Customer
2. Contract Number or Other Identification Number
3. Contract Type
4. Total Contract Value or Volume
5. Description of Service 
6. Contracting Officer Point of Contact and Telephone Number
7. Technical/Project Manager Point of Contact and Telephone Number
8. Provide a brief (2page) description of your firm?s history and organization and a description of its facilities, products, services, and customers as they relate to performance of pre-and post-award contracting for the commercial and Government.

AGAIN, NO SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  This is for information on source availability only.   No site visits or pre-solicitation conference will be held until a determination of source availability is made by this Office.  If a contract should be awarded as a result of any A76 competition, it will be because the cost of contracting are lower than the cost of continued Government performance as prescribed in the current OMB A76 Circular and Revised Supplemental Handbook.  All Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. The successful offeror shall provide all management, supervision, quality control, coordination, personnel and labor to perform the above services. Due to the type of work conducted in BEP, it is required that contractor personnel be United States citizens. Additionally, some of the functions involve working with sensitive information; therefore, all company personnel must be eligible for a full access security clearance. It is anticipated that there will be one procurement action required to complete this action, if the cost comparison results in contract award. The expected term of the contract shall be an initial one-year award and four one-year options with a total contract period not-to-exceed 60 months.  A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center?s Hard Target Attack Division, Precision Strike System Program Office (WMGH), plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about 21 Feb 2003 for the BLU-113 P3I program.  This announcement serves as Notice of Contract Action (NOCA).  This program is scheduled to begin in FY03 with two years to design, develop, and test a new or modified warhead leading to a production of approximately 350 All-Up-Rounds (AUR) beginning in FY05.  The objective of this effort is to increase the penetration, survivability, and lethality of the current design to improve the capability in defeating hard targets.  Survivability areas to be addressed are: fuze mounting hardware, payload, and case.  The resultant warhead will be incorporated into the GBU-28 system with minimal impact to operations and logistic support.  There will be no changes to the guidance and tail kits other than minor changes to adapters, lanyards, and other miscellaneous hardware required to accommodate potential reshaping of the warhead.  Changes to mass properties will be permitted as long as those changes do not require a full flight certification program.  The designated launch platforms are the F-15E and B2 aircraft and shall require no modifications to accommodate the resultant system. A Draft RFP (DRFP) is being issued concurrently with this notice on the government website, www.eps.gov, although certain DRFP attachments (and RFP attachments when one is released) will be available only through the Aerial Targets Information Management System (ATIMS).  This requirement excludes foreign participation at the prime contractor level.  Additionally, this acquisition will involve data that are subject to export control laws and regulations.  Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) and have submitted a DD Form 2345 to the contracting office shall be granted access to ATIMS.  Request an ATIMS account for this procurement via internet at http://atims.hill.af.mil.  Register for EGBU-28 BLU-113 P3I Program.  Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-800-353-3572) for further information on the certification process.  The government will provide each interested offeror with an opportunity to participate in a ?dry-run? of oral proposals.  This dry-run will be conducted using the DRFP.  The purpose of this dry-run is to provide both the offerors and the Government with feedback, which should help offerors in preparing their formal oral proposals, and the government in evaluation of oral proposal procedures.  The government team will use the experience to refine the DRFP into a formal RFP.  The dry-run oral proposals are for learning and will not be recorded, or have any carry-over to the formal oral proposals.  These DRFP dry runs will be scheduled the week of 3 February 2003.  One day will be allotted per offeror.  Request scheduling to present a dry-run oral proposal not later than 24 Jan 2003.  You will be notified of the precise date and details concerning this dry-run opportunity. DD Forms 2345, requests for dry-run oral proposal scheduling and comments concerning the DRFP should be provided to Chris Asbill, Contract Specialist, Phone 850-882-9514, extension 3268, Fax 850-882-0877, E-mail ellen.asbill@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>AMENDMENT THREE (3) to FA2550-03-R-0005 SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  Global Positioning System Support Center. 

1. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 2002 code for this requirement HAS BEEN CHANGED to 541330, Engineering Services, exception: Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, with a size standard of $23M.  The NAICS code has been provided for purposes of identifying small businesses and for large business subcontracting prospects and does not restrict potential sources.  This acquisition IS NOT a Small Business Set-aside.  Full and open competition is anticipated.

2. The contractor currently providing this service is Overlook Systems Technologies, Inc., a sole-source subcontractor to Booz Allen Hamilton.  The Booz Allen Hamilton Contracting Officer for the IATAC contract is Mr. Joe Steele.  The Subcontracts Manager that handles the GPS Support Center is Mr. Ken Wierzbic.  Both individuals can be reached at 703-289-5000.  

3. This effort is a minute subtask of a larger task, which is only a small part of a delivery order issued under a sub-CLIN of a broad-scope IATAC contract.  Therefore, a Schedule B and task number for the current GPS Support Center effort is not available, nor would a Schedule B provide any meaningful insight into the current effort.  The current effort is approximately $3M annually; however, the new effort includes some evolvement to the current effort.

4. The performance period for the new contract would begin 01 Oct 03.  A phase-in period of 30 days is planned if the successful offeror is not the incumbent or its subcontractor, Overlook Systems Technologies, Inc.

5. An in-depth acquisition schedule is not available at this time.  No solicitation is available at this time.  Any proposals received before the release of the formal solicitation will not be considered.

6. Please advise if this effort can be accomplished under a GSA vehicle. If these services are available on a GSA schedule, please indicate the schedule number and the GSA contract number in your response.  If possible, provide a copy of the GSA contract.

PLEASE NOTE: RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED.  If your firm has not already submitted a capabilities package, potential interested sources are required to do so no later than 15 Jan 2003. If this amendment affects any portion of a capabilities package already submitted, please submit a short written amendment by the same date as above.

Large OR small contractors who believe they possess the expertise and experience shall submit technical capabilities in writing to Ms. Karla Weaver or Ms. Janet Stinson, 50 CONS/LGCZW, 300 O'Malley Ave, Suite 49, Schriever AFB, CO 80912-3049, or electronically to karla.weaver@schriever.af.mil or janet.stinson@schriever.af.mil.

Amendment #3

Included in the following amendment are answers to questions and concerns raised by contractors and a disc of modified drawings.

The following are questions that have been submitted to us after the release of Amendment 2.

12. (This question was not sufficiently addressed in Amendment 2) Will there be storage space provided in the building for light fixtures and other equipment? As of this time there is no storage space available on-site. 

13. Will the testing of ?Fire Fighters Service Operations? need to be performed during other than regular working hours? No, the testing is not expected to be performed during ?other than working hours?. All service operation testing has to be performed with GSA Fire Safety personnel present. After testing the alarm sirens once, the remainder of tests can be performed with the alarm in silence mode.

14. Will the borehole drilling for the new hydraulic elevators need to be conducted during other than regular working hours? No, the drill rig for elevators 8 & 9 do not need to be scheduled in other than working hours. All drilling will be in the sub-basement with the air compressor outside the building.

15. Will the testing of the smoke detectors require the use of real smoke, canned smoke, magnets or some other means? This will be for the fire alarm contractor to decide, but all procedures should meet manufacturer and installer requirements.

16. Will the new three-phase power and emergency power for the elevators continue to be 208AC or will it be converted to 480AC? The three-phase power will remain 208AC.

17. There is currently special engraving in cars 1-4 that identifies ? Public Exit ?. Will this engraving be required on the new car operating panels? Yes, engraving will be required. The lobby ?Star? is standard designation for public level. It is easy and inexpensive to add ?Public Exit? during shop drawings process.

18. Relative to cars 1-4, the spec refers to the ?main lobby?. Will this be the employee entrance at G level or 1, which is the public entrance? This will affect placement of the position indicators. The position indicators should be at the ground floor as specified for the employees and security, the main users of elevators 1-4. This is the formal lobby and security control point for these cars.

19. On elevator #5 will the touch pads in the car and at each landing be retained or will they be replaced? If they are replaced a cutout size will be needed and extra labor will be required for removal of old and installation of new. The Hirsh scramble pads are installed, owned, and maintained by the USMS. They are noted to be retained and reused.

20. Relative to the gearless traction elevators, following research with suppliers, it would seem that DC machines might be a more favorable option for the application over AC. Would it be possible to bid the project utilizing DC equipment vs. AC? Yes, AC or DC is acceptable based on the manufacturers recommendations and requirements. We do not want to enforce something that is not compatible with specified and approved equipment.

21. How long can the VAV boxes be out of service when they are being replaced with new VAV boxes? New VAV boxes should be on-site before any demo work of existing duct work is initiated. VAV boxes should be installed the same day.

22. A majority of VAV boxes are in the hallways, however, there will be some VAV boxes that will need to be installed in the office areas.  Many offices will also need a new temperature control equipment and control wires.  The installation of these items may require the relocation of desks and other office furniture and equipment.  Who can relocate this furniture and equipment?  How long can it be moved from its original location?  Who is responsible for disconnecting and reconnecting of office equipment so we can install controls and VAV boxes ( Phon

Amendment 4


Please note: The bid due date HAS NOT been extended. The due date remains January 14, 2003 at 2:00 p.m. Chicago time.


Questions or concerns rose after the release of Amendment 3.

33. Who is responsible for moving the marble slabs being stored in the vault area under the sidewalk? The contractor will be responsible for moving and inventorying the slabs. A storage space (within 100 yards from the vaults) for the slabs will be provided in the building on the same floor. Any damage occurring during movement of the slabs will be the contractor?s responsibility.

34. On page 15900-5 para. 2.2.c.2 it specifies U.L. Listed plenum rated cable when not installed in conduit.

On page 15900-11 para. 3.3.c it specifies ?install control wiring in raceway per Div 16- Electrical unless otherwise noted.? After reviewing Div. 16, we found that section 16740 allows the installation of low energy cable without conduit for the Communications System.

We feel installing cable in raceway significantly adds to the overall cost of the project.

With a few minor exceptions, all of the existing systems have been installed with plenum rated low energy cable. Of particular note, all of the existing VAV box and Dual Duct VAV box controls have been installed using low energy cable without conduit.

Could you please clarify how we are to install the low energy cable for the control system? Is it to be installed in conduit? The project specification 15900 refers to Raceway and Fittings. 16110-6 item 3.4B and 3.4C indicates electrical raceway depending on application. EMT conduits are generally used in interior partitions, above suspended ceilings above 6' in exposed areas of mechanical rooms.  IMT is to be used below 6' in exposed area of mechanical rooms. Cabling system for section 16740 - Communication are completely different application than controls wiring.
es, Computers etc)?  The contractor is expected to have laborers relocate existing furniture. The sub-contractor will send written notice of which rooms require access to JFI?s superintendent. The super will notify building operations to schedule access and tenant preparation (moving equipment, packing files, etc.) for contracted work.
23. Can we work in the hallways during the day? No. All common-area work must be done during non-working hours.

24. How long can the ceiling tiles and lights be out in the hallways?  The more times the ceiling tiles and lights are handled the more likely they can become dirty or damaged. We do not know how long ceiling tiles will be out in the hallways but it should be noted that the contractor is responsible for all finishes or equipment that is relocated for work in their scope. It will be the contractor?s responsibility to provide temporary lighting if it is necessary.

25. During the installation in the office area equipment and office furniture will be covered and protected, however, it is likely that a small amount of dirt and debris may find its way onto desks and office equipment.  Will the GSA cleaning staff take the responsibility to clean the construction areas of minor dirt and debris after our work is complete? The contractor is responsible for making sure the area is clean and in the same condition it was in prior to any work being done. 

26. How much square footage can be made available to us for the on-site storage of HVAC equipment and controls? Please bid as if no on-site storage space is available.

27. Where will we be able to unload the HVAC equipment for this project? All equipment can be unloaded at the building?s loading dock. 

28. Will there be any special inspection requirements for the new HVAC equipment before it is allowed in the building? The contractor is responsible for inspection and acceptance of all HVAC equipment into the building.

29. Can the HVAC equipment be commissioned and accepted in phases? HVAC equipment will be commissioned on a floor by floor basis. Warranty period begins at substantial completion.

30. When does the warranty for the HVAC equipment begin? The warranty period begins at substantial completion. 

31. Door B025 is shown on detail A12 sheet A601 but is not shown on Door Schedule on sheet A510- please clarify. Door B025 will be added to Door Schedule A510.

32. In trying to get pricing on the light fixtures we are being told that the Type A1 fixture part number indicates that it has been modified from it?s original design. Can you supply the contact name at Antique Lighting Company that is aware of the required modifications so that we can get pricing on this item? Please contact St. Louis Lighting Company at (314) 863-1414 in regards to Model # Type E CD-6436MOD. 

The following statements were made at the pre-bid conference in Milwaukee on December 12, 2002:

1.	The Judge?s elevator (#6) should be included in the new maintenance requirements package.
2.	The question of modifying the original phasing plan for elevators 1-4 was raised. Because of the complexity of elevator work and associated building work involved, the opportunity to leave one elevator in each group operating while the other is renovated is not feasible. The scope of work is to remove all elevator equipment, mechanical and electrical equipment, demolish the concrete motor generator mounting pads, remove wall board and associated materials, etc. and then install all of the new equipment and components. Allowing one elevator to remain in service with this type and extent of building work occurring simultaneously is liable to place the safety of the riding public and the various trades people involved in jeopardy.
3.	The code required for this project is ASME 2000 with 2002 addenda.
4.	The elevator certificate frame size as specified fro elevator #8, section 2.08, B, 2, is incorrect. The correct certificate frame size is 8? wide by 5.25? high.

POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place:  Juan Francisco Clerico A., Executive Director, Vinccler Oil and Gas, C.A., Prolongacion Avenida La Salle,Edificio Fiorela, P.B., Colinas de Los Caobos, Caracas 1050, Venezuela, Phone: 011-58-212-793-1411 or 782-4666, Fax: (58-2) 793.6331, e-mail: vinccler@vinccler.com  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a new natural gas pipeline that would originate from the gas field at East Falcon Block, and extend west to the edge of the Gulf of Venezuela, where it would join up with an existing cross-country gas transmission pipeline owned by PDVSA.  

The project sponsor, Venezuela de Inversiones y Construcciones Clerico, C.A. (Vinccler), is a privately held Venezuelan firm that was founded in 1956 by the Clerico family.  Vinccler is a leading Venezuelan construction firm with its own in-house engineering and design capabilities.  Vinccler was the first Venezuelan company to participate in the country?s Field Reactivation Program, which began in 1992.  The company owns interests in the South Monagas Unit in eastern Venezuela, and the East Falcon Block in western Venezuela.  Vinccler, together with Pacific Petroleum LLC (of California), are planning to develop and further expand the existing East Falcon Block located in the northwestern part of Venezuela, approximately 200 km northeast of Lake Maracaibo.  Pacific Petroleum?s role in the project is as a developer, and they have no long-term interest in operating the gas field development.  The proposed study is needed in order to fully exploit the proven oil and gas reserves.  Due to the enormous quantities of gas associated with the oil from East Falcon, Vinccler and Pacific have entered into discussions with Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) to expand the original scope of the project to now include the exploitation and commercialization of gas.  

The gas project would encompass the construction of a new natural gas pipeline that would originate from the gas field at East Falcon Block, and extend west to the edge of the Gulf of Venezuela, where it would join up with an existing cross-country gas transmission pipeline owned by PDVSA.  The project consists of gas gathering and treatment equipment to be located in the East Falcon exploration and production block, a compressor station, and underground 12-inch diameter pipeline with an approximate length of 100 km, and control and metering devices.  The total estimated project cost is $60 million, of which $34 million represents potential US exports.  This project is being carried out under terms of an Operating Service Agreement (OSA) signed in 1995 between PDVSA and Vinccler.  


The terms of reference for the feasibility study would include the following tasks: 1) Pipeline and Flow Line Route Study, 2) Pipeline and Flow Line System Study, 3) Cost Estimate & Outline Program, and 4) Study Report.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $375,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM local Caracas time, January 15, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The Grantee for the project is Puertos de Anzo?tegui S.A. (PASA), a corporation created by the State Government of Anzo?tegui to administer the public and commercial ports within Anzo?tegui.  The Port of Guanta belongs to the state government of Anzo?tegui and is managed by PASA, whose mission is to strategically develop activities for productive and efficient commercialization, and for the generation of revenues to support economic, social, cultural and tourism growth in the State of Anzo?tegui and Venezuela.  Within Anzo?tegui, PASA manages both public and private port facilities, the most important being the Port of Guanta, which has an approximate length of 1,100 meters and has a capacity for between six and eight large cargo ships.  

In order to ensure optimal service and increase and improve cargo-handling capacity for both imports and exports, a rehabilitation and expansion plan for the port was presented by PASA for US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) feasibility study funding.  The scope of work for this feasibility study would cover the following areas: 

?	Review any previous studies and evaluations
?	Perform an analysis of the grain terminal demands
?	Perform an analysis of domestic and transshipping container demand
?	Perform an analysis of passenger ferry demand
?	Develop recommendations for a port security system
?	Analyze the demand requirements for a Ro-Ro berth
?	Develop recommendations for rehabilitation and improvements of the gate control operations
?	Determine environmental regulations and constraints and prepare recommendations
?	Prepare capital cost estimates for each viable project
?	Develop an implementation schedule
?	Develop a financing program
?	Prepare interim, draft and final reports

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $225,000 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 4:00pm local time (State of Anzoategui, Venezuela), January 10, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Program Research and Develop Announcement (PRDA) 
for Ship Disposal Solutions

Description: THIS MODIFICATION AMENDS THE ORIGINAL PRDA BY PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PERIOD, FROM March 10, 2003 THROUGH March 14, 2003. ALL PROPOSALS MUST BE RECEIVED BY MARAD NO LATER THAN 4 PM EST ON MARCH 14, 2003 TO BE CONSIDERED UNDER THIS SUBMISSION PERIOD.
The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is seeking innovative engineering/technical/ production/management solutions for the disposal of multiple obsolete vessels located in the reserve fleet sites in the James River, VA; Suisun Bay, CA; and Beaumont, TX.  A complete listing of obsolete vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A.  The list of ships (Attachment A) is subject to change.  Some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.  MARAD anticipates that the obsolete vessels in the worst condition, many of which are located in the James River Reserve Fleet, will be disposed of using traditional competitive contracting practices, depending on the availability of funding.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) has been issued to solicit industry comments to that end.

In an effort to obtain maximum program flexibility, the Government is seeking, from public and private concerns innovative solutions for the disposal of the remaining obsolete vessels by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2006.  The use and/or development of Government facilities is not excluded.


Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to the PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

?Y Innovative engineering/technical/production/management approaches for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A
?Y Environmental and worker safety/health considerations associated with the disposal of obsolete vessels and the abatement of hazardous materials
?Y Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
?Y Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with the disposal of obsolete vessels
?Y Funding requirements associated with the proposed approach

In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

?Y Feasibility and likelihood of success of engineering/technical/management approach for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A and the risks associated with the proposed approach
?Y Productivity of the proposed approach(s) including schedule/cost assessments
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed environmental, worker safety and health considerations proposed and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed abatement of hazardous materials and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the complete disposal of obsolete vessels
?Y Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed engineering/technical/management solution


In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price.   

Historically, the annual program level associated with MARAD ship disposal has been $10 million. The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised/competed.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or proposal(s) in their entirety to implement innovative solutions offered. 

Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals:
To be given evaluation consideration, submissions in response to this PRDA must conform to the following standards:

1. Technical/engineering/production/management solutions, inclusive of the listing below,  shall not exceed 25 typewritten pages, single sided, single spaced, Arial, 12 pitch:
?Y Production throughput/capacity
?Y Environmental considerations
?Y Worker safety and health considerations
?Y Hazardous abatement considerations
?Y Requisite experience

2. Funding/pricing requirements must be proposed in sufficient enough detail to show all anticipated costs associated with the complete dismantlement of the vessel(s), including cost categories such as towing, remediation of hazardous materials, labor costs etc, as appropriate. Pricing information must be detailed enough to permit the Government to make a determination of cost realism and reasonableness when assessed against the proposed approach. 
Submission of pricing information shall not exceed 3 typewritten pages, single sided, single-spaced, Arial, 12 pitch.

Individual offeror?s may submit multiple proposals.  Proposals must be separable and each in accordance with the above criteria.

 Instructions for the Submission of Proposals:
Responses to this PRDA must be submitted not later than 4:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on March 14, 2003 to:

	U.S. Department of Transportation
	Maritime Administration
	Office of Acquisition, MAR-380
	400 Seventh Street S.W., Room 7310
	Washington DC 20590
	Attn: Mr. Michael Delaney 

Offerors must submit five (5) complete copies for each proposed approach, inclusive of  technical/engineering/production/management and funding/pricing proposals. Electronic submissions will not be accepted.  

It is the intent of the Maritime Administration that this notice be valid until 1 year from the initial date of posting, unless otherwise canceled/amended. 

Subsequent proposal submission periods under this PRDA are as follows, unless otherwise canceled/amended:

	January 7 ? 11, 2002
	April 1 ? 5, 2002
	July 8 ? 12, 2002

<SUBJECT>M -- A76 ROLLER RECOVERY AND INK MANUFACTURING
<SOLNBR>BEP-03-0021
<RESPDATE>121302
<CONTACT>Robert Knauer, Contracting Officer, Phone (202)874-5827, Fax (202)874-3135, Email Robert.Knauer@bep.treas.gov
<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is issuing this NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT for an A-76 study being performed at our Washington, DC and Fort Worth, Texas locations. In response to the announced Commercial Activity study of 30 positions covering Ink Making and Roller Recovery, this action will comply with the ?current? procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, the "Commercial Activities" program. Services involved are described below for each functional element. A cost comparison will be performed later in the calendar year to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the ink making and roller recovery services performed by Government.  Therefore, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is seeking vendors nationwide that have the capability, background, skilled personnel, past experience and resources to provide the Bureau with two distinct functions:Ink Manufacturing and Roller Recovery operations.  

Ink Manufacturing is located at two geographic locations (Washington, DC and Fort Worth, TX).  The Washington and Fort Worth facilities both produce a variety of different inks each year for use in the production of U.S. currency.  The inks produced are 1) intaglio inks used on intaglio printing presses and 2) high security inks for use on letterpress presses.  The equipment used to produce the different types of inks includes automated batching systems for weighing ink ingredients, industrial mixers of varying capacities and high-pressure three-roll mills for complete dispersion of raw materials.  Since the quality of the inks produced at the Bureau is very critical, a testing laboratory staffed with full-time chemists is maintained in the section to perform certification tests on all ink batches.  Inks must pass the respective tests before they can be used in currency presses.  In addition to regular ink production, the Ink Manufacturing Section also provides technical support for the development of new and experimental inks. (NOTE:  The ink chemists and technical support staff who do ink development are NOT currently included in the number of positions subject to our A-76 analysis, since they are members of the Office of Technical Support and not the Office of Production Support as are the ink makers.)

Roller Recovery Section Operation: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing?s Roller Recovery Section produces wiper rolls and inking-in rolls for the cylinder wipe, intaglio printing presses used to print U.S. currency. To fabricate a wiper roll, three distinct layers (different formulations and physical properties) of PVC (polyvinylchloride) material are applied to a steel wiper roll core using special application and curing procedures. First,  raw materials are mixed together to make the various formulations of PVC coatings.  Then, the PVC is applied to the roll.  Following application of the PVC layers, the wiper roll surfaces are finished and polished in a lathe to obtain specific dimensions and surface finish.  To produce a wiper roll that meets the physical requirements of operating on high-speed currency presses, the Roller Recovery Section closely monitors the quality of both incoming raw materials and the PVC formulations of the respective wiper roll layers. Operation of the PVC coating machines and the mechanical soundness and condition of wiper roll cores are also monitored very closely.  When completed, all wiper rolls undergo a series of final quality inspections to assess the bonding of PVC layers, hardness and surface defects.  In addition to regular wiper roll production, the Roller Recovery Section also provides technical support for the development of experimental rolls needed for new inks and currency design features.    

ACTION REQUIRED: It is requested that any vendor in the United States having the skilled personnel, talent, capability, resources and past experience to provide the above service and operation of these functions provide by email the following information to the point of contract indicated in this notice, Mr. ROBERT KNAUER.  Please provide:

1. Name of Company Contract
2. Phone and Fax numbers
3. Email addresses
4. Company Website address
5. At least six (6) commercial and government references that can verify that your firm has done the type of work contemplated and that provides information about the quality of your past performance. Include the following information for each contract:

1. Name of Contracting Activity or Customer
2. Contract Number or Other Identification Number
3. Contract Type
4. Total Contract Value or Volume
5. Description of Service 
6. Contracting Officer Point of Contact and Telephone Number
7. Technical/Project Manager Point of Contact and Telephone Number
8. Provide a brief (2page) description of your firm?s history and organization and a description of its facilities, products, services, and customers as they relate to performance of pre-and post-award contracting for the commercial and Government.

AGAIN, NO SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  This is for information on source availability only.   No site visits or pre-solicitation conference will be held until a determination of source availability is made by this Office.  If a contract should be awarded as a result of any A76 competition, it will be because the cost of contracting is lower than the cost of continued Government performance as prescribed in the current OMB A76 Circular and Revised Supplemental Handbook.  All Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. The successful offeror shall provide all management, supervision, quality control, coordination, personnel and labor to perform the above services. Due to the type of work conducted in BEP, it is required that contractor?s personnel be United States citizens. Additionally, some of the functions involve working with sensitive information; therefore, all company personnel must be eligible for a full access security clearance. It is anticipated that there will be one procurement action required to complete this action, if the cost comparison results in contract award. The expected term of the contract shall be an initial one-year award and four one-year options with a total contract period not-to-exceed 60 months.  A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated.

<DESC>DELAY/DENIAL TECHNOLOGIES TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CRITICAL NATIONAL SECURITY ASSETS AND WEAPONS SYSTEMS  The Force Protection Command and Control Systems Program Office (ESC/FD) wishes to identify for possible demonstration purposes, products or concepts that delay and/or deny unauthorized access to critical national security assets and weapons systems.  On 18-19 March 03, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) and Sandia National Laboratories are hosting a Nuclear Weapons Security Enhancement Summit at Sandia National Labs, Albuquerque, NM.  The day after this conference, we are offering the opportunity for organizations, Government or private industry, to display and discuss their potential solutions to the attendees of this summit.  These solutions should include anything from non-lethal delay to lethal denial. Displaying organizations should discuss the capability of their solution(s) from a performance perspective. Of particular interest are technologies that "lean forward" to provide defending forces new and integrated solutions to defeat hostile intruders that are determined to gain access to high value assets.  Starting later this fiscal year, we anticipate initiating a multi-million dollar program to develop, test, integrate, and install and/or upgrade delay/denial technologies at high value assets locations.

<DESC>For the program year 2003, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), Asian Longhorn Beetle (ALB) Program will be chemically treating thousands of potentially infested trees at designated areas in New York and Chicago.  APHIS intends to approve the application device that offers the best value to the ALB Program. Devices will be evaluated on the following performance objectives: (1) ability to deliver the specific systemic pesticide in a manner that results in it translocating to the twig and leaf tissue throughout the tree crown, (2) ability of the device to regulate outflow pressure, (3) capability of the device to deliver specific dosages, (4) ease of replenishing or switching chemical bottles, (5) reliability, and (6) cost efficiency in delivering chemical at pressures that do not harm hardwood type tree species. APHIS has been considering devices produced or developed by Arborjet, Arborsystems, Davey Tree Expert Company, J.J. Mauget Co., and Sidewinder Injection Technology Pty. Ltd., however, application devices produced and developed by other firms may receive consideration for use in calendar year 2003 provided the firm submits a sample of their applicator to the USDA, APHIS, PPQ, Otis Plant Protection Laboratory no later than close of business January 21, 2003. APHIS' selection of the device to be used by government contractors on Spring 2003 ALB Control Treatments will be made within 2 weeks thereafter.  For additional information contact Robert J. (Bob) Crowther at 612/336-3205.

<DESC>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is a 370 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) independent regulatory agency charged with administering and enforcing the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) of 1975--the statute that governs the financing of Federal elections and its amendments.  The FEC has four major statutory responsibilities:  (1) Provide disclosure of campaign finance information, (2) Ensure that candidates, political committees, and political parties comply with the limitations, prohibitions, and disclosure requirements of the FECA, (3) Administer the certification of public funding for Presidential elections and ensure that all related expenditures comply with FECA, and (4) Serve as a clearinghouse for information on election administration.  The Office of Planning and Management is seeking a commercial off the shelf  (COTS) system to provide automated support for the development of the Commission's budget, tracking its annual goals and objectives, and producing it?s strategic planning documents.  The Federal Election Commission is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to industry to obtain market research in order to assist in the development of a Request for Proposals.  

All interested parties must respond via e-mail with information about their services with sufficient technical and price detail to allow for a detailed evaluation to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Aaron H. Ford at aford@fec.gov or via telephone (202) 694-1328, no later than 7 February 2003.  The subject line of the e-mail message should be Planning and Management Program.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System code is 541519.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations.  Firms that wish to respond to this RFI should provide the following information:  (1) a brief summary of the budget/planning COTS package/services offered in response to this RFI, (2) a statement indicating an interest and capability to provide the services as described, (3)  a technical approach to the Statement of Work provided herein, and (4) a cost estimate.  The cost estimate will be used for budgetary planning purposes.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY!!!  It is neither a Request for Proposals (RFP)/Solicitation, nor an indication that the FEC will contract for the products/services described in this RFI.  There is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products/services .  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the RFI.  The Government will NOT pay for information received in response to this RFI.  Submitted documentation will NOT be returned to those firms who provide responses to this RFI.  

Statement of Work
  
The Office of Planning and Management performs the following five functions for the FEC:  (1) budget formulation, (2) budget management, (3) monthly budget reporting, including MIS data, (4) developing and monitoring annual performance plans, and (5) measuring performance in meeting Commission mission and program goals and objectives.  The FEC has recently converted its payroll and finance accounting system from a 1032/COBOL environment to PeopleSoft financials, running on an Oracle platform.  In addition, the FEC payroll is processed by the National Finance Center (NFC).  Consequently, the Budget Office's payroll projection and budget systems are no longer integrated with the new PeopleSoft systems.  The replacement system must incorporate payroll projection and FTE monitoring and projection capabilities of the current budget systems.  Currently, personnel cost and FTE projections are calculated based on data pulled from a file generated by NFC and copied to the FEC system on a bi-weekly basis.  The current projection allows calculations for the remainder of the current year and the next two years.  The current year projection shows actual year to date plus a projection for the remainder of the FY, by pay periods, by person and office, as well as for the entire Commission.  The projections for the next two years provide costs by person and by office, as well as for the Commission as a whole.  Costs are projected for salaries and benefits, including FEGLI, FEHB (health insurance), and CSRS and FERS (including TSP) retirement costs.  

All projections are based on actual staff on board, and are provided for each person, for each office and for the entire Commission.  The projection provides the flexibility to adjust any combination of factors, including retirement, within grade increases (WGI), COLAs, health insurance costs, for planning and for development of what-if scenarios.  

The new system must be able to import FEC furnished data from the payroll and personnel systems.  The resulting data must be able to be exported into software packages (i.e. the Microsoft Office suite).

Project Scope -- Mandatory functionality of the proposed COTS software: 

1)	accurate salary calculations based on actual days and pay periods, with within grade step increases (WGIs) calculated as of the effective date and the ability to query WGI costs separately;
2)	projections of FTE and costs for the rest of the current year and the following two years; 
3)	 the ability to calculate and easily change government-share rates of health care, retirement, and locality pay costs;
4)	data should be transferable to Excel spreadsheets;
5)	the ability to generate budget reports by division, by employee, and FEC wide; 
6)	the ability to generate management reports by division and FEC wide; 
7)	the ability to interface with the FEC PeopleSoft finance and accounting system, and, therefore incorporate non-personnel object class data with personnel cost data for budget preparation and presentation purposes (object class scheme attached);
8)	produce FTE reports that feature actual hours and FTE to date cumulatively and by division or office; 
9)	 the FTE and personnel data must be usable in a budget preparation system that complies with GPRA requirements and OMB A-11; 
10)	depict staff on board in paid status as of end of each pay period; 
11)	must run on an Oracle platform and be compatible with PeopleSoft; must be         ODBC and OLAP compliant;
12)	must provide on-line and live operational support Monday-Friday 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM Eastern time, and  the ability to incorporate MIS data entry and performance data by division or office, to integrate MIS reports with the budget system.  

Additional capabilities for integrating budget tables and strategic planning documents include the following items: (1) The ability to create planning and budget documents in a standardized format; (2) The ability to store all planning and budget documents in a central location; (3) The ability to link planning and budget documents, so that changing one figure on one page changes that figure across all planning and budget documents.  

Project Tasks: 

(1)	Provide complete turn-key system; 
(2)	Install system; 
(3)	Train up to 15 personnel, 
(4)	Provide documentation; 
(5)	Provide range of coverage for service and maintenance, and costs associated with each level of service; 
(6)	Describe future upgrade capabilities if newer versions of product are scheduled to be available or are contemplated to be available;

<SUBJECT>U -- National Cancer Institute (NCI) - Science Enrichment Program (SEP)
<DESC>This proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with the University of Kentucky, pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This contract action will represent two (02) additional years of contract performance for the National Cancer Institute?s (NCI) Science Enrichment Program (SEP).    

NCI implemented the SEP in 1990.  The program encourages rising tenth-graders from under-represented minority and medically under-served population to pursue careers in biomedical research.  The overall goals of the program are to:  1) encourage under-represented minority and underserved students to select careers in science, mathematics and/or research, 2) broaden and enrich students? science, research, and socio-cultural backgrounds.  The major objectives through which these goals are met are executed by 1) providing opportunities for student to experience the fields of science, mathematics and laboratory research through hand-on techniques and resources that extend beyond those of the typical high school classroom 2) provide students with an ?I can-do-it? feeling regarding their abilities in the sciences and 3) Contribute to the advancement of a strong core future researchers.  

The project expanded in 1992 with the award of four competitive contracts.  The project was re-competed in 1998 with a successful award to the University of Kentucky.  
 
As of July 2002 approximately 1,750 students had participated in the SEP experience.  Although there are no longitudinal data yet about these students? continuing interests in the sciences as a career, data are beginning to show positive increases in their levels of academic confidence and attitudes about science.  In addition to assessing the aptitudes and attitudes of current students and tracking their progress, the program?s evaluation component also includes a survey of the 1,250 students who participated in SEP prior to 1997.  

The alumni study and collection of data was temporarily halted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) June 2002 pending their approval of NCI?s revised collection plan submitted in March of this year.  The revised plan also included a request for a six-month extension to complete a final round of parent?s surveys.  OMB will provide authorization to continue only after resolution of any issues that may be raised during the lengthy approval process.  

The intent of this sole source action is to prevent a programming hiatus with the SEP while NCI receives OMB approval and subsequently completes the evaluation work necessary to make an informed, evidenced-based decision regarding the continuation of the SEP program.  The data necessary for this decision will not be completed by the time the current contracts expire.  This extension will provide contract performance through January 2005.

This action is under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  All proposals received within 45 days after publication of the synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement (See numbered note 22).

<SUBJECT>--Subject:  Missile Defense Data Center (MDDC)
<DESC>NA The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) intends to enter into a non-competitive extension to Contract DASG60-99-D-0002, for 12 months beyond the original completion date.  The purpose of this extension is to continue support to the Informat ion Science and Technology Directorate for the Missile Defense Agency’s (MDA) Missile Defense Data Center (MDDC).  In addition, this action increases the ceiling to accommodate this additional year and the life of the existing contract.  The proposed actio n is for continued support to the MDA’s in the areas of specialized data ingestion, integrated multi-level security development, hybrid computer systems integration, dedicated data management, and specialized secure communications integration.  The MDA tes t community has had and will continue to have a very aggressive schedule of experiments.  The MDDC is tasked to collect, organize, ingest, archive, protect, and distribute data to customers throughout the United States and abroad. It is imperative that the se data continue to be made available to the approved users in a timely and secure basis.  The processes currently being developed provide the means by which the community of users can acquire the proper data in a timely manner and insure that the MDA meet  the programmed milestones to deploy systems mandated by Congress.   The purpose of this extension is to continue to support the Information Science and Technology Directorate in the area of data management by providing the following:  (1) Maintaining a ce ntralized repository for strategic and tactical missile data and information; (2) Provide for the collection, archive, organization, and distribution of these data for the MDA, DoD, U.S. Allies, and Intelligence communities; (3) Procure materials, equipmen t, and services at the direction of the MDDC Government Program Manager in order to maintain, upgrade, manage, and continue the development, integration, validation, and testing of the MDDC’s specialized subsystems; (4) Design, develop, and maintain the ga teway for approved users, and programs assigned to or using the MDDC Data Center, (6) Develop and implement use of the multilevel Information System Security Initiative (MISSI) hardware and software; and (7) to continue the development of automated data sy stems for the automated processing of data and information received at the MDDC.  These services and associated support have been provided by the incumbent contractor, CAS, Inc., under Contract DASG60-99-D-0002.  From 4 February 2000 to the present, the in cumbent has been the sole provider of data management services for the MDDC. Experience indicates that only CAS is sufficiently familiar and has the specific experience to accomplish this extension to the contract for an additional 12 months. The significa nt cost duplication that would be involved with a new firm is considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition for this short-term contract extension.  Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.30 2-1 (a)(2)(iii), this action is directed toward CAS, Inc.  This acquisition is not open to Allied participation.  All responses should be directed to SMDC-CM-CS/Astrid Lahiere and must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of the publication of this synopsis.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.   The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may i dentify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within 15 days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services . However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
