Current Testek/AAI Test Stands have proprietary data that does not give the Maintenance Complex the ability to perform all required maintenance, engineering services and repairs.</p>
<p>PURPOSE: We are conducting a fact-finding, industry day to gather vendor information and capabilities on maintenance, engineering, repair, upgrades and training services available for Testek/AAI Test Stands. It also provides potential vendors with a scope of our requirement. All information presented to the Government in one-on-one meetings may be kept for official use only (FOUO).</p>
<p>All information gathered during industry day is for planning purposes only, it does not constitute <br />an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP). It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract in connection with this industry day.</p>
<p>The government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with the industry day.</p>
<p>1 April 2013 - Industry Day Schedule:</p>
<p>0800 - 0815: Vendor and Government attendee sign-in<br />0815 - 0820: Welcome Remarks<br />0820 - 0825: Rules of Engagement<br />0825 - 0900: Informational &amp; Technical Briefing<br />0900 - 1030: Facilities &amp; Test Stand Tour <br />1030 - 1145: Break for Lunch<br />1200 - 1600: Individual Vendor One-On-One Meetings</p>
<p>The following is a list of suggested questions to be discussed at the One-On-One Meetings (this list of questions is not all inclusive).</p>
<p>1. Provide Company Name and Point of Contact (POC) information.</p>
<p>2. Offer acquisition suggestions examples for contract type and pricing structure.</p>
<p>3. Specify experience/capabilities with Testek/AAI Test Stands involving:<br />a. Hardware Maintenance<br />b. Software Maintenance<br />c. Engineering Services<br />d. Upgrades<br />e. Part Acquisition<br />f. Training Capabilities</p>
<p>4. Illustrate your company's capabilities in minimizing test stand down-time and maximizing test stand repair times.</p>
<p>Prior to the morning briefing, vendors will sign in, a sign-up sheet will be posted for vendors who wish to schedule one-on-one meetings with the Government procurement team. These meetings are anticipated to be one hour discussions between vendors and the Government. Vendors whom do not wish to meet one-on-one may submit written questions electronically to the POC no later than COB April 5, 2013. All questions and answers will not be considered private and will be available upon request to the contracting officer(s).</p>
<p>Capacity at our facility is limited; therefore, each vendor is limited to not more than three (3) Industry Day attendees.</p>
<p>Scheduling one-on-one meetings will be handled on a first-come, first-serve basis. Every attempt will be made to equally accommodate all vendors.</p>
<p>Please send all Industry Day attendance RSVP's, One-On-One Meeting requests, or any questions to Cindy Chartier at cindy.chartier@hill.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>This Public Announcement is for the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) Information Technology Shared Services - Solution Delivery (ITSS-SD) procurement under ONE IT.  This notice is being posted in accordance with the FAAs Acquisition Management System (AMS), Section 3.2.1.3.8: Pre-Release of Documents.   

Introduction:

The purpose of this follow-up notice to the previous Market Survey (posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities (FAACO) website on November 23, 2012 (#12500)) is to provide multiple updates to firms interested in the procurement formerly referred to as ONE-IT, please note the following:

1. Provide an updated DRAFT Performance-Based Statement of Work (PB-SOW) that reflects significant changes to the scope of work and includes other critical information regarding the FAAs objectives and requirements for this procurement (see Attachment 3). Accordingly, the name of the procurement has changed from ONE-IT to IT Shared Services Solution Delivery (ITSS-SD). This distinguishes it from other ONE IT-related procurements. Note that the FAA will continue to refine its requirements and plans to post timely updates as deemed necessary. Highlights of the PB-SOW changes include:

a. removal of Capability Area A2  Infrastructure Operations and Support (Section 5.1.2 of prior version released November 23, 2012). These services will be procured separately. 

b. include draft language for potential performance standards, incentives and metrics (see Sections 6 through 8 of enclosed PB-SOW). 

c. clarify the purpose of Domain B services (see Sections 1.1-1.2, 2.1, and 3.2 of enclosed PB-SOW).

Please note that although these documents are in draft form they continue to provide substantial representation of the FAA requirements. 
 
2. Emphasize the FAAs cost optimization objectives for the ITSS-SD contract. The IT Shared Services Organization has established a goal to achieve Operational Excellence through a strategy of Optimized Service Delivery, with a specific objective to: Drive down unit cost of service delivery for selected processes by 10% by FY2015. (Reference: Office of the Chief Information Officer IT Shared Services Organization OneIT Strategy 2013-2015). 

3. Provide the List of Interested Parties based on permissions granted in Market Survey responses. The FAA encourages interested vendors to review this list for teaming considerations, as teaming will be allowed for the ITSS-SD contract. 

4. Provide notification of the following formal change in Contracting Officers: the designated Contracting Officer has been changed from Elisa Brown to Tye White. 

Nature of the Procurement: 

At this time the nature of the competition has not been finalized.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. 

The FAA is contemplating awarding multiple contracts for a period of performance of seven years (two year base period and five one-year option periods).  

The principle North American Industry Classification System NAIC codes for this effort are:

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration has revised the Screening Information Request (SIR) for the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) - Dual Frequency Operations (DFO) Phase I based on comments received from industry and refinements to FAAs technical requirements.  Industry comments are solicited on the attached WAAS DFO SIR DRAFT II and Technical Data Package (TDP) documents. 

Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) Dual Frequency Operations (DFO) will utilize Department of Defense Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 Coarse Acquisition and L5 signals to maintain existing Single Frequency User Service and provide a new Dual Frequency User Service.  The realization of an L5 capable GPS constellation has been delayed and therefore WAAS DFO has been segmented into two implementation phases.  DFO Phase 1, represented with the attached Statement of Work (SOW), upgrades the WAAS infrastructure to enable reception and collection of the L5 signal with the WAAS reference station network and implements system changes required to sustain the WAAS.  

The FAA is not seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.  This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the FAA to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the FAA to a particular acquisition approach.  Responses to this notice are for informational purposes only and are made on a voluntary basis.  In order for responses to be considered by the FAA, they must be received no later than March 29, 2013.  The DRAFT SIR and TDP documents are subject to change and should not be used to respond to any future solicitation.  Please check the FAA Contract Opportunities web site for updates.

The TDP materials are available via the FAA's KSN website.  Both a user identification (id) and password will be required to access these materials.  To obtain a user id and password, email the request with the following information: 

   Company Name
   Requestors Name and Position/Title

2.  Geographic area where training will be provided;

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions - Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate a Purchase Order on a sole source basis with Convergence Medical Devices, Inc., (the "Contractor) located at 100 Sylvan Rd, Woburn, MA 01801, for an Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) measurement device.<br /><br />The Electromyography (EMG) Section at NINDS requires a handheld measuring device from the Contractor for systematic measurement of electrical impedance myography (EIM) in people with neuromuscular disease. The specialized EIM device needs to measure muscle anisotropy in multi-frequencies of EIM and be integrated into a software program that can measure and compute muscle anisotropy in multi-angle assessment of EIM measurement. EMG requires the device to function with a standardized configuration of sensors that can analyze a focal muscle at different angles and frequencies to reproducibly measure muscle physiology. An interface for data acquisition by a laptop computer is also required.</p>
<p>Convergence Medical Devices (CMD), Inc has developed new technology for a full EIM measurement system that consists of a Netbook PC with integrated software; a handheld EIM device for measuring localized bioimpedance at multiple frequencies; and a set of disposable sensors which attach to the probe and make contact with the patient. CMD is the only known source that can provide this type of EIM measurement device; No other source can satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The EMG provides innovative and reproducible methods for monitoring patients in neuromuscular clinical trials at NIH. EIM is a tetrapolar technique of noninvasively applying high-frequency low amplitude stimulation through the skin surface and measuring the resultant alteration in voltage responses produced by the underlying muscle. Unlike conventional electrodiagnostic techniques, the EIM results reflect characteristics of the structure and composition of the muscle rather than its specific electrophysiological characteristics, adding a different dimension to characterization of muscle in muscle or nerve diseases.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 12, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award prescribed in Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the competition requirements of Part 6. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions - Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions on behalf of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate a Purchase Order on a sole source basis with Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania (the Contractor), located at 3451 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104, and doing business as the Clinical Practices of the University of Pennsylvania, for characterization of MRI data acquired from study participants on a longitudinal basis.</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience at NIA requires services from the Contractor to perform quantitative analysis of MRI data collected from participants involved in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The NIA has been collecting MRI data samples from participants in this project for the last 19 years. Data Analysis will involve comparing thousands of previously collected MR images with new images and test for potential markers of Alzheimer's disease. Continuity of analysis is required for comparing new MRI data to the structural and functional brain changes in data previously collected.</p>
<p>The computer software and methodology used in the analysis of longitudinal neuroimaging data was developed and has been validated exclusively for use in this study. Services required by the Contractor will focus on the continued development of sophisticated tools and quantitative analysis of longitudinal structural MRI data acquired from BLSA participants. Characterization of MRI data from study participants would largely be lost, or need to be repeated, if services were acquired from other than the current Contractor. The computer software and methodology required to characterize MRI data collected from BLSA participants is not currently available in the commercial marketplace.</p>
<p>Since 1994, the NIA have been conducting a longitudinal brain imaging study of selected older adults in the BLSA to characterize individual differences in longitudinal brain changes. Data collected from the study will be used to investigate the extent to which these brain changes underlie individual differences in cognitive aging and to identify brain changes that may be predictors of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. MRI data collected in this study will assess the impact of potential modulators on brain and cognitive aging effects.</p>
<p>The Clinical Practices of the University of Pennsylvania is the only known source with the specialized knowledge and ability to reliably analyze MRI data from participants in this study. No other source of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Period of performance will be for one (1) year with the option to exercise four (4) additional one-year periods of performance.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 12, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award prescribed in Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the competition requirements of Part 6. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division intends to award a sole source contract to Polestar Technologies Incorporated, 220-3 Reservoir Street, Needham heights, MA 02494, to acquire engineering and design support to complete development of a Carbon Dioxide (CO2) sensor to be integrated into the divers mask.  Presently, the CO2 sensors output is provided to the diver as a simple light indicator.  

This procurement includes three options as follows:

Option 1:  Deliver indicators embedded in a porous polymer film that is suitable for viewing both red (CO2 sensor) and green (proper function indication) lights, capable of functioning in a high humidity, variable pressure and temperature environment.
  The contractor shall deliver six (6) prototype sensors.

Option 2:  Fabricate a fully integrated CO2 sensor unit embedded into a flow cell.  Provide six (6) units for testing.  Provide test results of the performance of the sensor unit integrated into a Mk16 re-breather.  Provide six (6) second generation CO2 sensor systems after incorporating recommendations based on testing performed by Naval Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU) on the prior generation sensor systems.  

Option 3:  Develop documentation necessary to support the Approved for Military Use (AMU) process including drawings, schematics and operation and maintenance (O&M) manuals in sufficient detail to allow repair, maintenance and accurate parts procurement by the end user (diver).

This acquisition is sole source for the following reasons.
  Polestar is the designer and developer of the CO2 sensor whose output is provided to the diver as a simple light indicator.  As the original designer and developer of the CO2 sensor, Polestar is the only company that can make the required updates to the sensor required by U.S. Navy fleet requirements.  This procurement is for the direct acquisition of engineering services for continued development of a highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  Given the complexity of the CO2 sensor and the level of system knowledge required to integrate the sensor into the diver mask, Polestar is the only source possessing the requisite expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the design and integration services.
 

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Department of Defense will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.

<DESC>MQ-9 Reaper - Second Source for Turboprop Engine<br /><br />(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<br /><br />(b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this document, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br /><br />(c) Background: The MQ-9 currently utilizes a Honeywell TPE331-10YGD engine. The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently produce a second turboprop engine for the MQ-9 Reaper. <br /><br />(d) A Technical Specification outlining requirements for the MQ-9 engine is available and will be provided by the Government to interested parties (please see the points of contact below). Responses must clearly detail that your firm's product(s) meet the Technical Specification requirements in detail. <br /><br />(e) In addition to the above, please provide the following information: <br /><br />1. If your company does not currently produce an engine that fully meets the MQ-9 Technical Specification, describe the nature of either: <br /><br />a. The extent to which design, development, test and evaluation would be required in order to field a compliant product, and/or<br /><br />b. The extent to which modification(s) to current products would be necessary in order to meet the Technical Specification requirements<br /><br />2. Describe your past experience (no more than five examples) in producing and maintaining similar engines for Government and/or commercial customers, to include:<br /><br />&bull; Program name<br />- Government contract number (if applicable)<br />&bull; DCMA Point of Contact (if applicable)<br />&bull; Description of the effort covering the following points:<br />-- types and quantities engines provided<br />-- specific post-delivery support and maintenance provided<br />-- modification/upgrade efforts, as applicable<br />&bull; Dates &amp; periods of performance<br />&bull; Value of effort <br /><br />3. What would be the approximate delivery lead time for an engine that meets the Technical Specification requirements?<br /><br />4. What risks do you foresee in performing this effort? What steps would you likely take to mitigate the risks?<br /><br />(f) The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition will be 336412, with a corresponding size standard of 1,000 (one-thousand) employees. <br /><br />(g) Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size status, particularly if they are small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), women-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, HUBZone, and/or service-disabled veteran owned small businesses in accordance with the NAICS code and size standard., and should also indicate if the company is foreign-owned, controlled, or influenced. <br /><br />(h) Acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition. <br /><br />1. Note that, if there is sufficient demonstrated interested and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.<br /><br />2. Note that if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage. <br /><br />(i) Interested sources should respond with a complete information package, providing the information and data requested above. All parties are asked to provide a point of contact, a telephone number, an e-mail address, and a facsimile number in their response.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  This is not a solicitation or Request for Proposals.  At this time, the Government is only seeking information for market research purposes. <br>  <br> 1.	Purpose <br> The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from persons, companies, and organizations with a proven track record of success who are interested and capable of providing the services described below.  This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. <br>  <br> 2.	Background <br> In March 1995, Department of Defense Directive Number 8220 was signed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense. This Directive officially assigned the Secretary of the Army the responsibility for establishing a Single Agency Manager (SAM) for the provision of Pentagon Area Information Technology shared services. The single agency manager (SAM) is now known as the U.S. Army Information Technology Agency (USAITA). <br> The intent of the USAITA is to be a customer-focused service provider that provides, manages, operates, and maintains Information Technology shared services for the Pentagon Area and select agencies and organizations in the National Capital Region (NCR). The Department of Defense Directive stated that USAITA was to be the central source for Information Technology services, and therefore eliminate the requirement for each Department of Defense component to establish, operate and maintain duplicative technology. The policy also explicitly directed USAITA to manage costs, as the directive outlined the responsibility to operate as a business, and continually evaluate new commercial alternatives to providing existing capabilities in the interest of finding cost savings. <br> USAITA is a field-operating agency under the operational control of the Army's Office of the Administrative Assistant. USAITA is an Information Technology (IT) service provider, and provides a range of shared services to the National Defense community. USAITA's customer base consists primarily of Department of Defense services and agencies inside of the National Capital Region (NCR). <br> The USAITA, Storage Services Branch (ITA-SSB) has a requirement for Operations and Maintenance (O&M) services in the support of an existing Enterprise Storage System for the Defense Continuity Integrated Network/Pentagon Continuity Information System (DCIN/PCIS) which has multiple locations within Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Washington DC.  Those functional areas of interest include, but are not limited to the following: <br>  	Administrative Services and Processes to include Asset Management, Configuration Management, and Integrated Logistics Support <br>  	Operational Services and Processes to include Incident Management, Problem Management, testing, Call Center support, and maintenance support to include automated failover and failback processes <br> All systems operations require personnel to have access to, at a minimum, Secret level information.  The prime contractor will be required to maintain a Top Secret facility clearance.  <br>  <br> 3.	Technical Scope of Requirement <br> DCIN/PCIS represents a network-centric solution that provides data storage and disaster recovery capabilities to assist DOD Pentagon area tenants in satisfying certain Continuity of Operations (COOP) and Continuity of Business (COB) objectives for mission essential functions. <br> The government anticipates around 65-80 Full Time Equivalents (FTE) contractor support personnel would be required to work on-site at multiple locations within the National Capital Region to support the requirement, with a phase-in/phase-out transition period overlapping the incumbent provider for a period of 60 days. <br>  	Data Storage:  DCIN/PCIS provides tiered enterprise data storage and infrastructure for Command and Control (C2) and Continuity of Business (COB) data requirements.  Enterprise storage supports Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU), Secret (S), Top Secret (TS), and Top Secret/Secure Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) data.  Current data storage capacity is approximately 6.2 petabytes of raw tier one and approximately 1.22 petabytes of raw tier two storage.  The anticipated annual data storage capacity growth rate is 35% per year based historical usage experience with the current customer base.  This data storage capacity is currently implemented with EMC and NetApp storage devices.  The associated fibre channel storage network is routed fabric utilizing Brocade Fibre Switches with 4000 NIPR ports and 3000 SIPR ports. <br>  	Data Replication: ITA-SSB provides the infrastructure to replicate data from primary locations to designated secondary target locations.  The Enterprise Storage Area Network (ESAN) supports synchronous and asynchronous replication. <br>  	 Automated Failover:  Failover software and services are provided by ITA-SSB to help tenants facilitate a solution to prepare for the recovery of mission essential functions from a disruptive event.  The failover process would activate a standby system at one of the remote target locations.  The enterprise failover software is currently implemented with EMC Autostart and Microsoft technologies. <br>  	Enterprise Backup Services (EBS):  EBS provides enterprise backup and recovery services to Pentagon tenants using a robust centrally managed system that provides flexibility for customers to manage their own backups while using the ITA-SSB disk-to-disk and disk-to-tape solutions with off-site replication.  EBS supports SBU, Secret, Top Secret and near future TS/SCI backup services.  EBS currently operates two backup systems, IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) and CommVault Simpana.  The Tivoli system is implemented with IBM AIX Power-Series server environment, including multiple IBM software products, Virtual Tape Libraries and Linear Tape Library Subsystems, Storage Area Networks and TSM hierarchical storage management and off-site network replication.  CommVault Simpana is implemented with Microsoft Windows Server environment and includes Virtual Tape Libraries and Linear Tape Library Subsystems, Storage Area Networks, and Network Attached Storage.  EBS maintains approximately 10 petabytes of stored backup data with a 70% growth rate over a 5 year period.  EBS operates a total count of approximately 4000 backup clients. <br>  	Enterprise Systems Management Center (ESMC): The ESMC performs monitoring, management, and systems administration functions for the ITA-SSB service and its mission critical components on a 24x365 basis.  The ESMC serves as the primary point of contact for all internal and external operational support issues.  The ESMC consists of a formal watch team located in a classified, controlled, limited-access environment requiring personnel to possess a current TS clearance.  The primary software tools currently employed by the ESMC include EMC ECC, EMC Smarts, BMC Remedy, Alterpoint, Paessler Router Traffic Grapher (PRTG), Failover Monitor, Virtual Instruments, and Brocade Network Advisor.  An infrastructure support team provides O&M support for the ESMC infrastructure. <br>  	Logistics Support:  Logistics and administrative support is provided to maintain asset information related to the ongoing purchase, operation, maintenance, license, and support of program owned hardware and software. <br>  	Customer Management:  Each tenant customer is assigned a point of contact to interface with the program to discuss new requirements and any program related issues.  Tenant customers are also provided periodic reviews to discuss program services and performance.      <br>  <br>   <br> 4.	Information requested  <br>  <br> 1.	Provide specific examples of your recent experience as it relates to the scope of ITA-SSB Operations and Maintenance.  Indicate the types of contracts utilized and document your organization's ability to work in a DOD classified environment.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice for Initialization Production and Support Services (IPSS) <br>  <br> Place of Performance:  Primary Production - Fort Hood, TX and/or contractor's place of performance (Upon Government Approval) <br>  <br> THIS NOTICE WAS ORIGINALLY POSTED UNDER SOLICITATION NUMBER W15P7T-12-R-0030 ON 18 OCT 2012.  TO BE CONSIDERED RESPONSIVE TO THIS NOTICE A NEW OR REVISED RESPONSE IS REQUIRED  <br>  <br> This Sources Sought Notice (SSN)/Request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes, and is not to be considered an invitation for bid, request for quotation, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No reimbursement will be a made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this SSN/RFI or any follow up information request. <br>  <br> This is a market survey to identify potential sources capable of providing Initialization Production and Support Services in support of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems. The planned acquisition is for one (1) base year and three (3) option years for improving and enhancing the Initialization Production process and initial and subsequent production of initialization deliverables. The scope of this market survey is to identify a potential source capable of performing all areas; respondents must outline their capability and capacity to perform all areas outlined in the attached performance work statement to be considered responsive. A detailed response is required for PD TNI to assess and to gain confidence the respondent is fully capable of meeting all areas of the PWS to include Management and Support Services.  <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT <br>  <br> The Tactical Internet (TI) is composed of a series of C4ISR systems (Command and Control systems like Advanced Field Artillery Technical Data Systems (AFATDS) or Command Post of the Future (CPOF)) and enablers (Communication systems like Warfighter Information Network - Tactical's (WIN-T's) Satellite Transportable Terminal (STT) and Network System's (NS's) Enhanced Position Location and Reporting System (EPLRS)).  Together this forms tactical C4ISR network architecture.  The original vision for the Army's Tactical Internet (TI) provided a networking capability at Corps and Brigade Levels.  These echelons have relatively fixed environments (command posts, installations, etc...) where it is feasible to provide communications via large satellites, shelter mounted equipment and semi-permanent structures (ex. Standardized Integrated Command Post Systems (SICPS)) providing high bandwidth networking equipment.  This portion of the TI is referred to as the Upper Tactical Internet (UTI).  Sometime after the development and acquisition of these UTI systems, the requirement to extend the network capability below the Brigade level (e.g., Battalion, Company, etc), and while on-the-move, was identified.  These new network capabilities required higher levels of availability and mobility, and were, therefore, constrained to the lower throughput capacities associated with tactical radio network transmissions. These follow-on capabilities of the Army C4ISR tactical network became known as the Lower Tactical Internet (LTI).   <br>  <br> Project Director Tactical Network Initialization (PD TNI) is chartered to initialize the TI (UTI and LTI).  In order to satisfy that need, the Government is proposing to issue a new competitive contract for IPSS.  Initialization Production is used to create Initialization Products (i.e., database files) to allow communication for both the UTI and the LTI networks.  <br>  <br> Initialization Products are defined as a collection of key mission information attributes which are loaded into Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) and other C4ISR systems, to allow each of them to communicate throughout the UTI and LTI networks.  Initialization Production includes the production, and maintenance of Government-owned data sets (i.e., Initialization Products) ensuring effective digital communication amongst the aforementioned systems.  Initialization Products are currently delivered by the Contractor, through electronic transfer of the data and/or by delivery of a Compact Disc (CD), to the Government.  Initialization Support Services (ISS) refer to the enabling functions relative to Initialization Product production:  Engineering, Configuration Management (CM), Quality Assurance (QA), Test, Program Management, and other Services, as required.  ISS also include the operation, development or enhancement, and maintenance of the Government-Owned database and Government-Owned database tools designed to produce and maintain the Initialization Products.  The entire scope of this effort requires work be performed which spans the life cycle of the Initialization Products and the maintenance of the Government-Owned databases and software tools from which they are derived.   <br>  <br> The Government anticipates award in September 2013, of a consolidated contract consisting of one (1) base year and three (3) option years for the development of a production capability (software development) on a hybrid Firm Fixed Price/Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract.  <br>  <br> This market survey requests detailed responses and information from interested sources capable of providing services in accordance with this Sources Sought Notice and the IPSS Draft Performance Work Statement. The Government does not have detailed documentation on hardware modules or the software source code for the Consolidated Initialization Tool (CIT) referenced in 'Task B' of the attached DRAFT PWS. Consequently, the Government does not have the detailed documentation or source code to provide to a third party. A limited technical data package will be made available at a future date.  <br>  <br> The assigned North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code for this potential requirement is 541330, for Engineering Services with the correspondence small business size standard of $14M. The exception, Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons with a small business size standard of $35.5M also applies. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to respond. <br>  <br> You must respond to all of the following information requests and questions as part of the  market survey to be considered responsive: <br>  <br> 1. State as to whether or not your company is considered a small or large business. Please also indicate any socioeconomic classification (8(a)), Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman-Owned, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, or HUB-Zone) that applies. <br> 2. Please explain in detail the technical ability and capacity to perform Task A and B in the PWS? Please address all areas of the Task A and B and the integrated approach.   <br> 3.

<DESC>Manhole Arc-Flash Testing Contracting Office Address:   NASA/John F. Kennedy Space Center, Procurement, Kennedy Space Center, FL 32899 Description:   SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE Manhole Arc-Flash Testing.	 INTRODUCTION The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is seeking capabilities from all categories of Small Businesses for the purpose of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or Small Business subcontracting goals for Manhole Arc-Flash Testing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida 32899.	 The NAICS code for this effort is 237130, title Power and Communication Line and Related Structures Construction, and the small business size standard is $33.5 million.  The estimated price range of this project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. SCOPE OF WORK The work to be performed under this project consists of providing all services as detailed below for electrical high power testing to determine the arc flash impact on cable splices inside a manhole/ vault to mimic the ground fault occurrences in KSCs 15kV power system. Provide all materials, labor, test lab services, permits, support services, tools, equipment, sub-contracts, transportation, per-diem, and lodging to provide support services at both the Contractors normal base of operation and an extended duration at the test lab location. The goal of this testing is to determine the Arc Flash effect on 15kV cable splices inside a manhole, when subjected to various fault levels ranging from 400A to 10,000A at 8kV phase to neutral, and to identify a condition, where the combination of reduced line to ground fault current level occurring on a splice within a manhole with a 6 cycle interrupting time significantly results in a reduced hazard to personnel who may be working within a manhole or cable vault located at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC).  The work includes but is not limited to the following: A. Provide electrical high power testing laboratory services. 1. Provide electrical high power testing laboratory services.  Testing shall occur at the laboratory site.  NASA has identified two potential laboratories located in North America that can perform the testing: a. KEMA  Powertest LLC, Chalfont, PA. b. Kinectrics  Toronto, Canada Any other high power testing laboratories capable of providing the testing services required are requested to provide detailed information regarding their capabilities. 2. Test lab shall have the capacity and equipment to perform multiple arc-flash tests over a one to two week testing period duration.  Test equipment shall be sized to inject and control current from 400A to 10,000A at 8kV phase to ground on a faulted 15 kV cable splices.  The fault duration shall be controlled to 100ms (6 cycles) or a longer duration (up to 200ms) as required.  All tests, equipment and test criteria shall conform to IEEE standard C37.20.7-2007 and IEEE standard 1584-2002. 3. Calibrated instrumentation shall record all testing results in two (2) laptop PCs, including. a. High speed video including any lens filters. b. Camera for still photos. c. Seven (7) Calorimeters arranged as described in IEEE 1584 section 8.2. d. Pressure level sensors and meters. e. Sound level sensors and meters. f. Oscillographic recording of voltage, current, and energy. 4. The 15kV cable to be used will be 350 kcmil and #4/0 AWG EPR cables with 1/3 concentric neutral per KSC specification.  Splices will be Raychem (HVS-1510S-J 2-tube and HVS-1512S-J-NASA 3-tube) splice kit typically used at KSC. Cable core conductor is to be faulted to the cable shield only using a minimal sized fine strand copper wire that will vaporize on energizing and start the arc.	The arc shall not extinguish before the set arc duration due to the reduced voltage applied.  The test shall be considered valid in a premature arc extinguishing situation only if the test voltage was set to the maximum and the peak current requirement is met per IEEE Standard C37.20.7. 5. Per IEEE Standard C37.20.7:	Test current and voltage for an arcing duration of more than 50ms shall be set to +/-10% of the rated frequency and the frequency of the waveform shall not deviate more than 8% during the test.  All voltage and current tolerances shall be set to +5% to -0. 6. For the maximum 10 kA fault current test, the peak current provided by the DC component at the instant of closing shall be 2.6 times the arcing current. For this, X/R ratio of the test source shall not be less than 15 which will give an asymmetrical to symmetrical RMS current ratio of 1.6. Fault initiation switch shall be closed at voltage zero crossing instant to provide the DC offset. For all other tests from 5000A to 400A asymmetry is not required. B. Provide support services prior to, during, and after the high power laboratory tests. 1. Providing safety procedure and test procedure documentation and any necessary worker training. 2. Obtain all necessary Governmental approvals required for travelling to and performing work at the test laboratory site. 3. Fabricate a test set-up for use at the high voltage laboratory.  Test set-up is to be completely pre-assembled and demonstrated for the Government at the Contractors location.  Equipment will subsequently be disassembled and shipped to the test laboratory for use in the testing.  The following major elements are  included: a. Concrete manhole including customized access provisions, cable racks, and lighting. b. Dead-front medium-voltage cable sectionalizing cabinet and dead-break connectors. c. Schweitzer Engineer Laboratory (SEL) protective relay and cabinet, including potential transformers and cabinet, current transformers, instrument transformer secondary cables, personal computers and (SEL) software. d. Power supply cable sections and terminations. e. Manikin, arc-flash PPE, and arc-flash blankets. f. Initial supply of faulted cable (splice) sections. g. Misc. test equipment including 5 kV DC megger and micro-ohmmeter. 4. Provide support at the test laboratory site including: a. Provide work crew at the test laboratory site for the entire test duration for preparing splices and supporting the laboratory requirements.  Augment crews as required for initial set-up of equipment and removal of equipment. b. Transport and unload all materials and equipment at the site.  Provide any crane and fork-lift services required to set the manhole and other equipment. c. Set-up and connect equipment and cables; execute procedures and checklists for the initial set-up and each subsequent test. d.

<DESC>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. RESPONSES SHALL BE USED FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND SHALL NOT COMMIT THE NIH TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION FOR THIS REQUIREMENT. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT A SOLICITATION BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF THIS MARKET SURVEY WILL BE PUBLISHED AND THAT A SUBSEQUENT FIRM FIXED PRICE CONTRACT FROM THE SOLICITATON WILL BE AWARDED IN 2013. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) expects the contractor to evaluate and report on the condenser and evaporator shell and tube heat exchanger, pump and motor sets, and cooling towers and electric systems for chiller and cooling tower systems 16 through 21 for repowering units to operate on refrigerant 134a. The contract vehicle for this Engineering Service is a Firm Fixed Price contract for a 36 month period. The total contract award value will not exceed $2M.<br /><br /><br />BACKGROUND: The main Central Utility Plant, Building 11, contains six (6) York 5000 ton R-22 chillers, and six (6) 5000 ton R-134a chillers with secondary pumping. NIH has to address the need to comply with the Montreal Protocol and the Clean Air Act as it relates to the future use of refrigerant 22 (R-22). Refrigerant 22 (R-22) is the last of the HCFC's (Hydro chlorofluorocarbons) present on site and known to be a contributor to both the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming. NIH has six (6) York 5000 ton R-22 chillers that must be either replaced or repowered with R-134a to continue to meet the NIH Bethesda campus cooling (chilled water) load. We presently have three York OM5000 models with electric chiller drives, two York M5000 models with electric drives, and one York M255137 model with a dual electric and steam drive. <br /><br /><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The selected contractor shall evaluate and report on the condenser and evaporator shell and tube heat exchanger, pump and motor sets, and cooling towers and electric systems for chiller and cooling tower systems 16 through 21 for repowering units to operate on refrigerant 134a. The evaluation will determine the possibility of salvaging the existing evaporator and condenser shell and tube units (heat exchangers), with necessary modifications, while replacing the compressor driveline, the evaporator and condenser pump and motor systems, and possibly the intercooler, cooling towers and controls for a more efficient operation without loss of cooling capacity. This comprehensive assessment shall include but not be limited to all associated components of the chiller system (s) mentioned above including the chilled water piping back to the common header for integrity and size, and the entire condenser water piping system to and from the towers including the common header. The assessment shall also include the structural support of the evaporator and condenser, the isolation pad layout, proposed components for the new chiller system, modeling to predict performance and capacity for the York 5000 ton chillers using 134a refrigerant, and modeling for the associated cooling towers. The selected contractor shall obtain York design and specification documentation, tools, software, etc. to analyze our systems and components that will remain in service for another 25 years to 30 years as well as the new components to match the existing components to remain in service.<br /><br />This is a small business sources sought notice seeking Small, Small Disadvantaged, SBA-certified HUBZone, SBA-certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)&nbsp;or Women Owned. <br /><br />Responses should include a narrative identifying the scope of past and current services contracted for within the past (5) years; describe capabilities to perform the services described in the synopsis; provide detailed experience with testing, evaluating, and engineering on York 5000 ton chiller systems including the associated cooling towers; and include references for each contract. Respondents should ensure their responses are complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine their qualifications and capabilities to perform the assigned work. Additional Information: Submission of additional supporting material is admissible only to the extent that it graphically (via drawings and photographs) substantiates the relevant project work specifically described. Additional material should not exceed 10 double-sided pages.<br /><br /><br />Send responses to the Contracting Officer to the address indicated below -- no phone calls or emails. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey or return the data provided. This is NOT a request for proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. <br /><br /><br />The awarded contract including all option years will not exceed $2M. The Government intends to award&nbsp;Firm Fixed Price Negotiated&nbsp;Contract inclusive of all three years.<br />

<DESC>A Concession Business Opportunity for Lodging, Food & Beverage and Retail Services at Mabry Mill and Rocky Knob within the Blue Ridge Parkway
On March 8, 2013, the National Park Service (NPS) will issue a prospectus for solicitation of offers for a 10-year concession contract to provide for Lodging, Food & Beverage and Retail Services at Mabry Mill and Rocky Knob.
Mabry Mill Overview (Mile Post (MP) 176.2) 
Mabry Mill is one of Blue Ridge Parkways most popular visitor attractions due to its rich history and picturesque environment.  Facilities at Mabry Mill include the historic gristmill, sawmill and blacksmith shop, which were built shortly after the turn of the 20th century and restored to provide visitors a view of pioneer life in Appalachia.  A short trail connects these structures as well as provides informative exhibits and interpretive displays.   Directly south of the historic area is the Mabry Mill Restaurant and Gift Shop, which caters not only to those stopping to view the mill, but also to visitors passing by and staying within the area.  Other nearby Parkway attractions include a variety of recreational activities that include hiking, camping and picnicking.    
Rocky Knob Overview (Mile Post (MP) 174) 
The Rocky Knob recreation area has more than 3,500 acres of mostly rugged, forested terrain, including Rock Castle Gorge.  An extensive trail system in Rock Castle Gorge, including the Rock Castle Gorge Loop Trail, a designated National Scenic Trail, provides excellent hiking and access to backcountry opportunities.  The Concession Opportunity at Rocky Knob includes the seven Rocky Knob Cabins.  The Cabins, with direct access to the southern entrance to Rock Castle Gorge, are historic structures constructed in 1941 by the Civilian Conservation Corps.  First developed as trail lodges, the Cabins were remodeled for use as family housekeeping units in 1950. Today, the Cabins offer a relaxed visitor experience with close proximity to several natural, cultural and historical sites including the Gorges hiking trails, the historic Mabry Mill, and Fairy Stone State Park.

<DESC>1. Introduction: <br />Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is conducting market research to identify qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources. Part of the market research is to publish a Sources Sought Notice seeking market information on businesses capable of providing the capabilities, as described below. This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this notice is strictly voluntary and will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this notice or the Government use of such information. Not responding to this Sources Sought Notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov).<br />The NAICS Codes and Product and Service Codes (PSCs) listed in Paragraph 5, "Additional Information," may also be applicable to this Sources Sought Notice. <br />2. Background: <br />The Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE<sup>TM</sup>) Consortium is an aviation-focused professional group made up of U.S. industry suppliers, customers, and users. The FACE Consortium provides a vendor-neutral forum for industry and the U.S. government to work together to develop software components and to gain consensus on a common framework, addressing such areas as open standards, best practices, guidance documents, data acquisition and competition driven business models.<br />The FACE Technical Standard was developed by the FACE Consortium and calls for software-based capabilities to be developed as components that interact with other software components through multiple FACE key interfaces, which will allow for reuse, third party technical insertion and increased component competition. The FACE Technical Standard defines the software computing environment architecture and interfaces intended for the development of portable components and applications. <br />NAVAIR plans to demonstrate potential open architectures, utilizing the FACE Technical Standard, Edition 2.0, and to influence future architecture development for both the joint DoD services Future Vertical Lift (FVL) and the F/A-XX. This activity includes establishing a prototype FACE environment in government laboratories at Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) Aircraft Division (AD) in Patuxent River, MD, NAWC Weapons Division (WD) in China Lake, CA, and U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) in Huntsville, AL. The laboratories will be used to validate the FACE Reference Architecture and allow for new capabilities and sensors to be integrated affordably and reach the fleet within a shortened time frame. The government facilities will provide the environment to baseline and enable the maturation of a FACE Reference Architecture to influence FVL and FA-XX software architectures and provide a collaborative environment for programs and industry to integrate their components into an open architecture for future demonstration and experimentation. The FACE labs will consist of a FACE environment and development station that will host multiple General Purpose Processors. The station will replicate a generic mission system using flight representative hardware. It will allow for sensor packages to be connected and the corresponding software to be hosted on multiple FACE computing environments and general purpose processors. <br />NAVAIR is conducting ongoing market research to determine industry interest in and ability to participate in the FACE demonstration through further market research, industry days or other contractual means. This will allow industry to bring their products to the FACE laboratory for integration, architecture development and demonstration. This demonstration will allow both large and small companies to deploy their products in a fully functional, standardized FACE software environment that will represent an actual implementation. An Air Combat Electronics (PMA209) industry day will be conducted on March 13, 2013 and will include an overview of the effort to demonstrate how the FACE Technical Standard can influence the FVL/FA-XX software Reference Architecture. If established, the planned start date for industry participation is January 2014. <br />The Government's goals for this effort are to: <br />a) Verify and validate the FACE Technical Standard to ensure the Government can meet their objectives.<br />b) Verify and validate the FACE Data Model to ensure the Government can meet their objectives.<br />c) Influence future platform architectures.<br />d) Promote collaboration with industry.<br />e) Allow industry to plug new capabilities into the FACE labs.<br />f) Promote innovation of new capabilities.<br />g) Identify potential integration issues.<br />h) Identify barriers to competition.<br />i) Understand the effects of the FACE business model.<br />j) Validate that the FACE Development and Conformance Test Tools are effective.<br />&emsp;<br />3. Submission Content: <br />The response to this notice should include, but is not limited to, the following:<br />a) Information on what current or potential efforts you wish to demonstrate.<br />b) Information on your ability, time-line and requirements to support the effort.<br />c) Information on your plan to meet FACE conformance requirements.<br />d) Information on preferred contractual means and justification as to why it is preferred.<br />e) Identify any limiting factors and/or risks which impact your ability to respond to or participate in this market research and any follow-on demonstration efforts.<br />f) A description of your capabilities to conduct the above requirements, in whole or in part and to produce/deliver/test a FACE conformant product or product line that satisfies the requirements of "Technical Standard for FACE, Edition 2.0."<br />g) Indicate if there is interest in participating as a sub-contractor and if your information, and which parts, can be shared with other interested parties.<br />h) Provide any additional documentation that you believe would be beneficial, including current participation in active SBIRs, to support this effort. <br />4. Format Requirements: <br />a) Information should be submitted (in Adobe electronic format) and is due no later than May 8, 2013, 11:00AM EST.<br />b) Response should be provided in 12-point Times New Roman font on a single-sided, double-space page with 1 inch borders and should not exceed 20 pages. <br />c) All responses to this notice should include the following: Company Name, Point of Contact, Address, Telephone and Fax Numbers, Email Address, DUNS number, CAGE code, and Small Business Size Status. <br />d) Respondents are reminded to properly mark any proprietary information, and NAVAIR will control it as such. Do not send any classified information. <br />e) Responses should be submitted to the contracting officer, contact information provided below. <br />5. Additional Information <br />a) NAVAIR will review responses and may schedule an industry day to facilitate additional information exchanges about the program. <br />b) Any and all costs incurred in responding to this market research, shall be borne by the respective respondents. NAVAIR will not reimburse any costs and will not be liable for any costs associated with responses to this market research. <br />c) After completion of the Air Combat Electronics (PMA209) industry day, which will be conducted on March 13, 2013, this notice will be updated to include the FACE presentation and any additional information provided for FACE during the industry day. <br />d) The following NAICS codes may also be applicable to this notice:<br />NAICS Code Description<br />511 Software Publishers<br />334 Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing<br />336 Transportation Equipment Manufacturing

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of the notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. <br>  <br> The government is seeking sources/vendors/companies that are capable to provide transportation to and permanent disposal of non-NRC regulated materials at appropriately licensed and/or permitted disposal facility(ies).  Such materials do not require disposal in accordance with 10 CFR 61 or 10 CFR 40, Appendix A and may include:  Low Activity Radioactive Waste (LARW), Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (TENORM), Low Activity Mixed Waste (LAMW), and TENORM Mixed Waste (TENORM/MW).   <br>  <br> Materials for disposal consist of soil and/or debris and are typically in volumes ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of cubic yards.  The source(s) of these materials may include a variety of project sites across the United States including Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) sites, Superfund sites, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) sites, and other sites where the Army Corps of Engineers has cleanup execution authority. <br>  <br> Transportation methods typically include use of bulk containers and transport via truck, rail, or a combination of truck and rail.  Empty bulk containers are transported to the project site and are loaded by the government (or designee) for transport to the disposal facility.  Trans-loading of materials containerized in appropriate DOT packages during transport to the disposal facility (e.g., transfer of closed intermodal containers from truck to rail) is generally acceptable.  Trans-loading of loose materials from one DOT package to another (e.g., transferring material from and end dump truck to a rail gondola) is sometimes acceptable and is subject to government review and approval prior to implementation.  During such review consideration is given for permits /licenses and physical/engineering controls proposed or in place to minimize or eliminate potential for spills or other loss of material. <br>  <br> This Sources Sought Notice is to determine the capability of potential sources and the availability of commercial sources and services pursuant to FAR Part 10.  This notice is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost incurred for their participation in this Sources Sought Notice.  Large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this survey.  <br>  <br> Interested sources shall submit electronically a narrative demonstrating their experience in these areas and any small business class certifications to LaShura.M.Johnson-Hidalgo@usace.army.mil no later than 2:00PM EST on 29 March 2013.  The narrative shall not exceed 5 pages (11 font minimum).  Tables, charts, graphs, etc., will count towards the 5 page count total (smaller font is allowed for these items, but the text must be legible).  Please make sure your business classification is identified on the first page of your response.  All data received in response to this Sources Sought Notice marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the government.  <br>  <br> No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation. In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made. <br>

<DESC>This Special Notice is about sequestration impact to FAA contractors. It is not a contract opportunity and has no attachments.


NOTICE TO CONTRACTORS DOING BUSINESS WITH FAA REGARDING IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT-WIDE SEQUESTRATION

As you are likely aware, due to the failure of Congress to reach a deal on deficit reduction to avoid sequestration, the President was required by law to issue a sequestration order canceling approximately $85 billion in budgetary resources across the Federal government for the remainder of the Federal fiscal year.  As we consider you a partner with the Department of Transportation, specifically the Federal Aviation Administration, we want you to be aware of how these unfortunate budget cuts could impact our contracts. 

At this time, the FAA is taking steps to mitigate the effects of these cuts, but impacts to many of our current contracts are unavoidable.  As we carefully review our contracts, examples of steps we may need to consider include not exercising contract options, stopping or suspending work, reducing the scope of work, negotiating lower prices or other terms via bilateral modifications, or partially or completely terminating contracts for convenience in order to meet the constraints imposed by sequestration.   Additionally, planned contract actions for new work may be rescoped, delayed, or canceled depending on the nature of the work and the degree to which it directly supports the agencys mission goals.

The FAA supports providing opportunities and promoting economic growth for all businesses, while especially encouraging and assisting small businesses, socially and economically disadvantaged businesses, women-owned businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  To that end, the FAA is committed to the inclusion of small businesses in its acquisition process and will seek to preserve procurement opportunities for small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.  

To the extent that your contract is affected due to these budget cuts, you will be contacted by the appropriate Contracting Officer with additional details.  The Contracting Officer is the only official with the authority to make these changes.   

We regret the difficult choices we must make, and the impact they could have on your companys workforce, revenue, and planning processes. Thank you for your continued partnership with the FAA and for your cooperation as we work together to manage these unfortunate circumstances.

Sincerely,
Patricia A. McNall
Deputy Assistant Administrator for 
Acquisition and Business Services, and 
FAA Acquisition Executive

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD NONCOMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT<br />
<p>Requisition No.: AG-0261-S-12-0030 Date of Notice: 03/08/2013</p>
<p>Contracting Officer: TANYA SPANFELLNER Closing Date: 03/15/2013</p>
<p>This notice will appear for 8 days from above date. <br />**************************************************************************************<br />Description of Supplies/Services:</p>
<p>The USDA Forest Service, Spring Mountain National Recreation Area, Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, requires services, non - personal, to provide all tools, equipment, materials, personnel and management to provide needed continuous vegetation information across the forest to support Forest plan revision. A mid-level (1:100,000) existing vegetation map and other products were prepared by partnership composed of the Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC), Region 5 Remote Sensing Lab (RSL), Adaptive Management Services (AMS), and the Humboldt-Toiyabe NF with coordination from the Regional Office of the Intermountain Region. <br />In this partnership, RSAC and RSL each provided general project management and expert vegetation mapping support, and AMS field crews collected thousands of field samples with guidance from the Humboldt-Toiyabe NF. Final map products are consistent with the Forest Service mid-level vegetation mapping standards, and are stored in the Forest GIS and National databases. The SMNRA is the last area where this project will be completed.<br />The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively IAW FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), to David Charlet, DBA American West Ecology due to the highly specialized nature of the work required. There are no other contractors that could feasibly do the work, because using another contractor would require months for even a highly qualified researcher to get up to speed where as David Charlet, has an intimate knowledge and has conducted extensive research and developed the capability to provide the services required for this project. The contractor has worked with Southern Nevada Agency Partnership (SNAP) in developing vegetation maps on agency lands throughout Clark County. This includes vegetation data gathered in and around the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Red Rock Canyon National Recreation Area, whose lands adjoin the SMNRA on the East. The contractor has the capability for theoretical analyses, exploratory studies and experimental design in related fields of science and technology, the contractor has the ability to assist in the development of this map that is compatible with GIS Southern Nevada Agency Partnership (SNAP) Team, needs and for the purposes of planning and adoptive management. This will also create a data layer format that meets or exceeds the current USFS standards. <br />The contractor has been able to define alliance types use for the delineation of associations required for the identification of understory species that are not present in the upper canopy; direct use of this associations is appropriate only where the mapping effort includes extensive ground observations. Thus, the alliance is defined as a grouping of associations with a characteristic physiognomy and habitat that share one or more diagnostic species that, as a rule, are found in the uppermost or dominant stratum of the vegetation. The contractor's alliance types are specific to the native plants in Clark County and are vital to be able to merge datasets across agencies.<br />Association is the most basic unit of vegetation in the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS). The NVCS defines an association as "a recurring plant community with a characteristic range in species composition, specific diagnostic species, and a defined range in habitat conditions and physiognomy or structure" (Jennings et al. 2004). The contractor's alliance types are specific to the native plants in Clark County and are vital to be able to merge datasets across agencies.<br />Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services/supplies shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement. All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist. This is NOT an RFQ. This does represent the Government's only written notice of this procurement. All responsible sources may submit a response which, if timely received, must be considered by the agency.<br /><br />The estimated/potential $45,000 <br />Place of Performance: Las Vegas, NV<br />*************************************************************************************<br />*************************************************************************************</p>
<p>This notice and any resulting contract or order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 05-66 (effective 28 Feb 2013).</p>
<p>All questions regarding this procurement shall be in writing, and addressed to Tanya Spanfellner at tspanfellner@fs.fed.us no later than 3/15/2013.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI): Novel Technologies for High Performance Computing
<SOLNBR>IARPA-RFI-13-02

<ARCHDATE>06282013
<CONTACT>Manfai Fong, Executive Officer, Email dni-iarpa-rfi-13-02@iarpa.gov
<DESC><strong>Synopsis</strong><br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process. This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future IARPA program, so that feedback from potential participants can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA. Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below. Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA Program BAA and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Background &amp; Scope</strong><br />There have always been computational challenges that demand more computing power than is available, and this tension has helped drive decades of dramatic increases in high performance computing (HPC) worldwide1. The top performing system (as of November 2012) delivers 17.6 PFLOP/s on a well-known benchmark2 while consuming 8.2 MW of electrical power. The U.S. Department of Energy's Exascale Computing Initiative aims to achieve3 1 EFLOP/s using ~20 MW of power within a decade. All of today's leading HPC systems use similar CMOS technologies in a variety of architectures; their continued adequacy for ever more demanding applications hinges on the annual performance improvements that have heretofore been a hallmark of the semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>In this RFI we seek information about novel technologies that have the potential to enable new levels of computational performance with dramatically lower power, space and cooling requirements than the HPC systems of today. Importantly, we also seek to broaden the definition of high performance computing beyond today's commonplace floating point benchmarks, which reflect HPC's origins in the modeling and analysis of physical systems. While these benchmarks have been invaluable in providing the metrics that have driven HPC research and development, they have also constrained the technology and architecture options for HPC system designers. The HPC benchmarking community has already started to move beyond the traditional floating point benchmarks with new benchmarks focused on data intensive analysis of large graphs4 and on power efficiency5.</p>
<p>A variety of alternative technologies with the potential to support high performance computation - in the broadest sense - have appeared in the research literature, but none have made the technical advances needed to compete with the mature HPC industry. Some technologies have the potential to do well on today's benchmarks but lack the maturity to do so (e.g., superconducting computation); others have the potential to achieve high performance on important computational challenges but are highly unlikely to do well on today's benchmarks (e.g., quantum computation, molecular/DNA computation, neural computation, optical computation).</p>
<p>With this RFI we seek responses that illuminate the breadth of technologies that offer the potential to build high performance computation systems to address hard computational challenges in the future, particularly where those challenges are not necessarily represented by today's HPC benchmarks. Some examples of technologies are given above, but these are not intended to be comprehensive. We are not interested in responses that reflect current conventional HPC technologies (e.g., graphical processing units).</p>
<p>Each response should be focused on a specific technology, and provide:<br />(1) A comprehensive description of the technical area,<br />(2) An assessment of the maturity level, technical challenges, technical community size and distribution across academia, industry and geography, location of<br />prominent researchers, level of research investment today (and sources of that investment: government/industry/other),<br />(3) A list of hard and important computational challenges against which the technology is likely to do well, with suggested benchmarks and metrics,<br />(4) The model of computation best supported by the technology (particularly where a non-standard model is envisioned),<br />(5) Technical areas which will benefit if the computational challenges are addressed, and whether this may lead to a potential commercial market,<br />(6) R&amp;D timeline(s) to demonstrate success, with level(s) of research investments and key milestones and metrics.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI will be used to decide whether to hold a focused workshop on novel technologies for high performance computation in May/June 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation Instructions to Respondents</strong><br />IARPA solicits respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program. IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues/obstacles, describe how the approach may address those issues/obstacles and comment on the expected performance and robustness of the proposed approach. If appropriate, respondents may also choose to provide a non-proprietary rough order of magnitude (ROM) regarding what such approaches might require in terms of funding and other resources for one or more years. This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.</p>
<p>IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the US. Responses from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged. Responses have the following formatting requirements:<br />1. A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicates its association with RFI-13-02.<br />2. A substantive, focused, one-half page executive summary;<br />3. A description (limited to 5 pages in minimum 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins) of the technical challenges and suggested approach(es);<br />4. A list of citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be accompanied by citations, and reference material MUST be attached);<br />5. Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting the key ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Submission Instructions to Respondents</strong><br />Responses to this RFI are due no later than 4:00pm Eastern Daylight Time on 5 April 2013. All submissions must be electronically submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-13-02@iarpa.gov as a PDF document. Inquiries to this RFI must be submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-13-02@iarpa.gov. Do not send questions with proprietary content. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMERS AND IMPORTANT NOTES</strong><br />This is an RFI issued solely for information and new program planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Respondents are advised that IARPA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. It is the respondents' responsibility to ensure that the submitted material has been approved for public release by the organization that funded whatever research is referred to in their response.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a solicitation based on responses received. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neither proprietary nor classified concepts or information should be included in the submittal.</span></strong> Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by IARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.</p>
<p><br />1 See, for example http://www.top500.org which publishes semiannual updates to a listing of the top 500 HPC systems in the world, ranked according to their measured performance on the LINPACK benchmark.<br />2 HPC system performance is reported as how many floating point operations they execute per second on benchmark tests. Today's leading systems have ratings that use the metric peta prefix, e.g., 1 PFLOP/second (or "1 PFLOP/s") refers to 1015 floating point operations per second. Similarly, "tera" (1012) is written TFLOP/s, and "exa" (1018) is written EFLOP/s.<br />3 http://science.energy.gov/~/media/ascr/ascac/pdf/meetings/aug12/2012-ECI-ASCAC-v4.pdf.<br />4 http:// www.graph500.org/<br />5 http://www.green500.org/</p>

<DESC>Notice Number: RFI D13PS00160 Response Due Date: March 29, 2013 NLT 4pm EST
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The U.S. Department of the Interior, Interior Business Center (IBC), Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) has an anticipated acquisition for assessment, recommendation, and implementation of a web-redesign.</p>
<p>Purpose and Background <br />The mission of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), an independent federal agency, is to promote the preservation, enhancement, and sustainable use of our nation's diverse historic resources, and advise the President and the Congress on national historic preservation policy. The ACHP issues the regulations implementing Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Section 106 requires federal agencies to consider the effects of projects they carry out, approve, or fund on historic properties. They must also provide the ACHP a reasonable opportunity to comment on such projects prior to the agency's decision on them. In carrying out this responsibility, agencies consult with others that have an interest in the historic preservation outcomes of federal projects. The ACHP provides technical assistance to users of the Section 106review process and conducts onsite training for state, local, and tribal government officials, Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, preservation advocates, applicants for federal assistance, and members of the public on how to carry out or participate in this federal historic preservation planning process.</p>
<p>The ACHP currently has two active web properties, www.achp.gov and www.preserveamerica.gov. ACHP employees use the web sites to provide valuable information to its audiences. On 9/27/2010, ACHP implemented a requirement for web-redesign using the Alfresco Web Content Management (WCM), by making an award to a single firm to design and implement, using an Alfresco partner system integrator to create, design and launch the combined redesign of www.achp.gov and www.preserveamerica.gov. The primary goal of the redesign was to improve the usability, information accessibility and content management for the site. The redesigned ACHP website would use utilize the Alfresco WCM system to manage and publish the ACHP's web content. Site content would be composed of the story-based content and data-driven content.</p>
<p>The project ended approximately 10/14/2011. The system (Alfresco Content Management System) is still unusable with a number of issued listed in the attached document. While the Alfresco CMS implementation, customization, design, and content loading for achp's new website was done, it requires further testing to identify/fix bugs, and prepare a production-ready final product using the latest appropriate version of the Alfresco software. The ACHP is composing a requirement for a single vendor to provide an assessment, provide recommendation and implement actions to complete the content management system implementation and launch the redesigned website.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information from qualified organizations which can show a demonstrated capacity to provide these services listed above.</p>
<p>Post RFI Plan <br />It is the intent of the Government, to issue a competitive Request for Quote (RFQ)/ Request for Proposal (RFP) as a result of this RFI. This will be a non-restrictive technical requirement to maximize competition and seek the vest value to the Government and taxpayer. The acquisition strategy, evaluation methodology, contract type and other acquisition decisions are to be determined.</p>
<p>Submissions <br />There are no page limits for this response. Responses may also include a more detailed cost proposal which outlines the costs of specific activities as supplementary information.</p>
<p>Deliverables <br />1. Certification in Alfresco/ Alfresco Certified Engineer <br />2. Approximate time table to complete project <br />3. GSA Schedule or Alliance contract number <br />4. Rough order of magnitude (ROM) <br />5. Past performance examples/ references that show successful comparable projects <br />6. Proposed methodology</p>
<p>Questions/ Responses<br />Based on interest of potential offerors, demonstration of the current Alfresco environment via remote/web teleconference (WebEx/Adobe) will be considered. Technical questions, suggestions and responses to this RFI shall be submitted electronically, by no later than 4PM EST on March 20, 2013.

<a href="mailto:mitchell.walton@navy.mil">POINT OF CONTACT </a>
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. 

MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: The Government is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey and Request for Information (RFI).  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at the Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN is looking to evaluate technologies from Research and Development (R and D) organizations, private industry and academia, that have the capability to detect, classify and track human activity in areas concealed by heavy foliage.
 The RFI is seeking technologies that the Government will investigate that have the potential of detecting, classifying and tracking concealed human targets within heavily forested areas. The Systems will be ideally ground-based, capable of operating in heavily foliated, littoral or riverine environments. It is anticipated that the submissions to this sources-sought announcement will be reviewed and down-selected and interested parties may be invited to participate in a product demonstration to evaluate the candidate technologies. This proof of concept demonstration is tentatively scheduled for Q3 FY14 at a time and place to be determined.


A.	Background:
Current systems for detecting, classifying and tracking human targets in heavy foliage provide limited capability and have high false alarm rates (FAR).
  Most testing to date for foliage penetration has been from airborne platforms with a downward view of heavy foliage. Results from aerial testing can be leveraged for this RFI, but a technology is desired that can detect human activity in foliage by surveying forested areas from a ground level stationary or mobile platform. 
The objective of this RFI is to identify promising technologies and systems for the problem statement. The information from this RFI may be used as the path forward for extended testing in operational environments. 

Capabilities: See Attachment 1


B.	Requested Information: 
Sources are requested to provide potential solutions based on the ability to meet the Performance Criteria.
 If a potential solution meets some of the Performance Criteria but cannot meet others then please highlight what can be met and what cannot. For those Performance Criteria that cannot be met please detail the level and/or reason for the shortfall. 
Interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as white paper). This white paper should not exceed 15 pages, with an executive summary (short paragraph) on the effort. The white paper ideally addresses the primary categories listed below and as many of the optional categories as possible.
Primary Categories:
Description of technology including fundamental principles
Description of system including all major components
Ability to meet performance criteria 
TRL level of the system or technology with substantiating justification 
Size and weight 
Power requirements 
System limitations
Previous foliage penetration testing performed with system
Costs (initial and operational)
Data output format and ability to interface with other systems
Ability to participate in product demonstration during Q3 FY14 at a date and          location to be determined 
Optional Categories:
Description of techniques and user interface used for tracking/alerting 
Data output and interface method
Effects of different types/density of foliage 
Latency of detection
Maintenance requirements
Photographs/drawings of top level system/prototypes

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC) funded a research effort to gain a better scientific and technical understanding of the Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) plate component materials, integrated plate performance and component interaction effects to relevant military threats. The outcome of this research is a better understanding of design trade spaces and paths to SAPI plate optimization. The design of experiments accounted for ceramic type, crack arrestor metal, ceramic/metal adhesive, and metal/polymer adhesive. The SAPI configurations were challenged with multiple ballistic threats to aid in understanding performance.
<p>Marine Corps Systems Command believes that sharing the technical information produced during this research will benefit both industry and the Department of Defense. Therefore, the USMC is hosting an industry day to share the lessons learned from this evaluation. Members of the research team will present findings followed by an open question and answer session. A technical report will also be made available to attendees.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall contact the Product Manager (PdM) Infantry Combat Equipment to reserve seats for the briefing. The industry day will be held at 0900 on 18 March 2013 at 1000 Corporate Drive, Suite 301, Stafford, VA 22554. Visit requests must be arranged by emailing paul.m.lee@usmc.mil. Due to resource demands, space is limited and requests will be fulfilled on a first come, first served basis. THIS INDUSTRY DAY IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES. NO ENTITLEMENT TO PAYMENT OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT COSTS OR CHARGES BY THE GOVERNMENT WILL ARISE AS A RESULT OF THIS INDUSTRY DAY.</p>

Addenda to the following paragraphs of 52.212-1 are: <br /><br />(b) Written proposals are due on or before 3 PM (ET) THU 14 MAR 2013. Submit by email to kelly.higgins@rl.af.mil with a copy to andrew.clark@rl.af.mil; or by mail to AFRL/RIKO, Attn: Kelly Higgins, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514; or by facsimile to 315-330-2555.

Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.<br /><br />(g) Contract award. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.<br /><br />(k) System for Award Management (SAM). Offerors must be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice. Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing.<br /><br />The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (JAN1999) applies and is tailored as follows:<br /><br />1. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate: PRICE, TECHNICAL CAPABILITY, and PAST PERFORMANCE. When combined, Technical Capability and Past Performance are approximately equal to Price. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br /><br />(a) PRICE: The Government will rank offers by "total evaluated price". Offeror's total evaluated price is the sum of prices for the basic requirement and all options. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Price will be examined for reasonableness and balance.<br /><br />(b) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY: Next, the Government will evaluate the technical capability of offers in order by price on a pass/fail basis. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. Offeror's proposals determined to be technically capable will be further considered for award.<br /><br />(c) PAST PERFORMANCE: The contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on all offerors based on (i) responses to the past performance inquiries for the offeror's past and present efforts provided by their references and (ii) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. To assess performance, the Government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources, such as other Federal and other governmental agencies, commercial sources, Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined in the table below. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history, or offerors whose performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.<br /><br />SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />LIMITED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the<br />required effort.<br /><br />UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br /><br />(1) If the lowest priced evaluated proposal is considered technically capable and is rated as Substantial Confidence in the past performance assessment, that proposal represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops. Award shall be made to that offeror without further evaluation of any other proposals. <br /><br />(2) If the lowest priced technically capable offeror is not rated as Substantial Confidence, the next lowest priced, technically capable offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is rated Substantial Confidence, or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision if the lowest priced, technically capable proposal is not rated as Substantial Confidence in the past performance assessment. <br /><br />Offerors are required to complete representations and certifications found in the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (DEC 2012) and ALT I (APR 2011), DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items (JUN 2005), DFARS 252.209-7999, Representation By Corporations Regarding An Unpaid Delinquent Tax Liability Or A Felony Conviction Under Any Federal Law (Deviation) (JAN 2012), and DFARS 252.209-7998 Representation Regarding Conviction Of A Felony Criminal Violation Under Any Federal Or State Law (Deviation) (MAR 2012).

<p>SUBMISSION OF OFFERS:</p>
<p>1. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this solicitation is 337215. The NAICS code had a Size Standard of 500 employees. Per FAR 4.1201(a): Prospective contractors SHALL complete electronic annual representations and certifications (Reps &amp; Certs), via the SAM website at www.sam.gov. If you previously registered at www.ccr.gov and completed representations and certifications at www.orca.gov and your account would not expire prior to contract award, then this data should have migrated to the SAM records. SAM has replaced both CCR and ORCA. Your Reps and Certs must include the NAICS applicable to this solicitation document and indicate your organization's business size status.</p>
<p>Since the size determination is based on the number of employees, the method for determining business size status is based on the average number of employees of the concern (including part-time and full-time employees of its domestic and foreign affiliates), which is based upon the number of employees for each of the pay periods for the preceding completed 12 calendar months. [Additional definition is available by searching 13CFR121 at http://www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr/index.html] (13 CFR 121.106)</p>
<p>2. Submissions of offers:</p>
<p>Quotes are to be submitted via email by 1:00 PM March 14, 2013. Emailed quotes must be submitted to both michael.barnes@deca.mil and heather.jarratt@deca.mil by this date and time. The complete quote with authorized representative's signature must be received by the closing date and time.</p>
<p>3. The offeror's Quote shall address the evaluation factors in 52.212-2 and provide the following information:</p>
<p>a.Price- A column has been provided, beside each item, for Quoters to provide their FOB Destination price for each item. <br />b.Technical Capability- Each quote sheet provides a column, beside each item, for Quoters to provide specifications, pictures or item numbers with access to either an online or paper catalogue.</p>
<p>4. Multiple Awards are possible.</p>
<p>5. Shipments to each location must be made in one delivery. The shipment must 1) include an<br />itemized list of items in the shipment AND 2) the truck driver must stay until the inventory is complete and annotated. Discrepancies due to the contractor's failure to do either "1" or "2" as described will result in<br />denial of payment for missing items as indicated by the receiving documentation at the commissary.</p>
<p><br />TO BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD, OFFEROR MUST COMPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>Step 1: Complete Pricing Sheets:</p>
<p>Pricing sheets must be filled out and submitted with the quote. In order for the pricing sheet to be considered completed, individual prices, total prices, and either specifications, pictures or catalog numbers must be provided for all items Quoters intend to bid on.</p>
<p>Step 2: Complete clauses 252.209-7999, 252.225-7000, 252.232-7000 and 52.212-3 Alt I (if it is not already filled out in the Quoters SAM profile).</p>
<p>Step 4: Return the completed via email to Michael Barnes at michael.barnes@deca.mil and heather.jarratt@deca.mil. Any quotes received after the appointed time will be late and may not be considered for award.</p>
<p>If there are any questions regarding the solicitation or any of its attachments, please send them via email to both the Contract Specialist, Michael Barnes, at michael.barnes@deca.mil, and the Contracting Officer, Michael Shaffer, at michael.shaffer@deca.mil. All questions will need to be submitted before 1:00 PM on March 11, 2013.<br /><br />The Government requires a minimum acceptance period of 120 calendar days in lieu of 30 calendar days as specified in FAR 52.212-1, paragraph C, entitled Acceptance of Offers.</p>
<p>All prospective awardees MUST BE Sam.gov registered prior to receiving an award. If your firm has not registered yet, you are highly encouraged to do so NOW. Information concerning CCR requirements may be viewed via the Internet at sam.gov.</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(1) The Government will make awards resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoters whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>a.Price- CLIN 0001 will be evaluated on a item by item basis. If a quoter has the lowest price and is providing a product that is technically acceptable, they will be awarded that item. Quotes will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than one award (multiple awards). It is assumed, for the purpose of evaluating quotes that $500 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this quote, and individual awards will be for the items or combinations of items that result in the lowest aggregate cost to the Government, including the assumed administrative costs. In other words the government must receive at least a $500 benefit by splitting awards for multiple contracts in order for multiple awards to be conducive to the government. Also, no individual contractor awards will be made under $3,000.</p>
<p>b.Technically Acceptable- Specifications or proposed items when compared to the items solicited must meet the form, fit, and function of that solicited item. Also to qualify as an acceptable offer, the offeror must agree to all terms in this request for quote and be found responsible in accordance with FAR Part 9.</p>
<p><br />(2) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>H) Offerors shall provide a complete copy of the provision 52.212-3 ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Aug 2009) (as applicable) with their quote, which may be completed electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. Offerors that fail to furnish the required representation information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation, may be excluded from consideration. All FAR &amp; DFARS Clauses may be viewed in full text via the Internet at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/, or http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is OPM2613Q0087 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC)<br />2005-64 dated January 18, 2013.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 611430 and the small business size standard is $10.0 million. This procurement is set-aside exclusively for small businesses, allowing only a small business to submit proposals.</p>
<p>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Center for Leadership Development (CLD) provides high quality leadership and management development for supervisors, managers and executives across the Federal government through both multi-agency and single-agency designed courses. OPM has established two leadership institutes, the Federal Executive Institute in Charlottesville (FEI), Virginia, and the Management Development Center's (MDC's) with locations in Shepherdstown, West Virginia and Aurora, Colorado. OPM also offers courses at the OPM Headquarters in Washington, D.C. and at other locations. <br /><br />As a Federal business enterprise, CLD provides services that assist Federal agencies in achieving their missions by providing competency-based leadership programs to build great leaders for great government. <br />In support of its mission, OPM needs to acquire up to (3) contractors to provide Visiting Program Director services to organize, facilitate and deliver up to (5) Management Development Seminars I: Learning from the Middle (MDS I). The Management Development Seminar-I is one of the core development programs designed to help managers learn and apply knowledge and skills that support their roles and responsibilities. Today's Federal managers often find themselves in the challenging position of operating "from the middle" and need the skills and insight to lead teams and influence leaders above them at the same time in ever more complex organizations. Self-understanding, communication skills, and insight into follower-leader relationships are critical for their success and often difficult to learn on the job. <br />The course methodology includes a variety of formats: lecture; self-assessments; group discussions and exercises; real world experiences and examples; and a small group consulting project. The program is nine days in length over a two week period. The program begins at 1:00 PM on the first Monday of the course and ends by 3:00 PM on the second Thursday of the course.</p>
<p>This course supports the development of the following OPM competencies: Accountability, Conflict Management, Developing Others, Leveraging Diversity, and Problem Solving. These competencies are part of the OPM Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs) which are used as indicators of leadership success in the federal government. For more information on the ECQs please see http://www.leadership.opm.gov/.</p>
<p>OPM intends to award up to (3) Firm-fixed Price contracts to the offeror(s) that represents the best value to the government. The offerors shall provide all labor, incidental materials, and other services necessary to render services under the resulting contract, see Statement of Objectives (SOO) detailed below. The period of performance is listed in the SOO below.</p>

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE:</p>
<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the EQIP entry to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the service unit for this purpose.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), located in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis Advanced Informatics, located in Minneapolis, Minnesota for the renewal of site licenses for 769 students to E*Value software for one year. <br />This service will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br />Sole source determination is made in accordance with:<br />FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition<br />(b) Soliciting from a single source<br />(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.<br />The mission of USU is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services.  As such, it is essential USU provide the necessary training and equipment required for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers and to support our research efforts.  <br />Advanced Informatics is the sole provider of access to their proprietary software E*Value. The software is necessary because the entire university already uses this software to track and evaluate progress of students. For consistency of records, it is imperative that we continue to use the same software that has been in use for at least the past six (6) years. Also, the use of this system is based on the premier functionalities that would assist in meeting the ACGME guidelines for the GME/NCC programs. This online evaluation management system will ensure that our Program Directors will be in compliance and meet accreditation requirements as set forth by the Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).
<p>Specific ACGME guidelines to which NCC GME programs must adhere include establishing and maintaining 1) a system for scheduling and monitoring resident duty hours in the learning environment in order to mitigate excessive service demands and fatigue, and 2) the ability for programs to collect, maintain and track the thousands of evaluations from the multitude of internal and external didactic rotations trainees as a whole must complete as part of their program curriculum and individually in order to graduate.  For the past 6 years E*Value has been highly effective in providing the means by which the NCC has been able to comply with these requirements.</p>
<p>Since the initial implementation and institution-wide integration of the E*Value system in 2007, roughly 940 faculty, 600 trainees, and 40 administrators have been trained and are relatively proficient in the use of the various E*value modules to perform program management functions such as generating program and institutional management reports, processing evaluations, posting and monitoring duty hours , distributing rotation goals and objectives, scheduling set-up and management, and recording attendance at educational events.  Switching to another system would be extremely costly in terms of retraining system users, including over 1000 physicians whose main priority is patient care and can thus allocate limited time and resources towards learning a new system.  The NCC has now reached a level of unprecedented system standardization which has greatly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of our ability to manage our GME programs and provide institutional oversight as required by the ACGME.  In addition, E*Value is now the repository for 6 years of historical data that may be arduous and costly, if not impossible to extract in mass.  Lastly E*Value has a proven track record of providing the required services with sound technical support.</p>
<p>Advanced Informatics is the only know source that can provided the requested equipment.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued.  Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government.  Responses must be received via email (stephen.enokida@usuhs.edu) by 2:00 p.m. EST on March 18, 2013.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695.</p>

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />Factor 1, Delivery<br />Factor 2, Past Performance<br />Factor 3, Price</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION FACTORS ARE LISTED IN THE ORDER OF IMPORTANCE.</strong></p>
<p>QUOTES SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:</p>
<p><strong>FACTOR 1, DELIVERY:</strong></p>
<p>The Coast Guard will consider a better delivery schedule highly important. If alternate proposed delivery dates are provided by the offeror, those dates will be evaluated by determining which offeror's proposed delivery dates are the most advantageous to the Coast Guard mission. Items will not be considered received until they are delivered onboard USCGC CONFIDENCE itself. Parts delivered only to the Patrick Air Force Base and not CGC CONFIDENCE will not be considered received.</p>
<p><strong>FACTOR 2, PAST PERFORMANCE: </strong></p>
<p>The offeror shall provide two (2) RELEVANT contracts completed during the past five (5) years or currently in the process for the same requirement that are being solicited under this contract. This evidence of experience must include sufficient information to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate the proposal relative to the above requirements (i.e. contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, a point of contact and telephone numbers for each contract). The Government may waive the submission of past performance information by the company if adequate data already exists on file with this office.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a)(2) Past Performance Evaluation. The Contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions:</p>
<p>- Quality of Product or Service</p>
<p>- Did the customer consider the final product high in quality?</p>
<p>- If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected?</p>
<p>- Schedule, were orders fulfilled on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, Contractor delayed, government delayed?)</p>
<p>- Business Relations, how was the customer service?</p>
<p>Was the Contractor committed to customer satisfaction?</p>
<p>Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)?</p>
<p>In evaluating Contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Assessment Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. General trends in a Contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;FACTOR 3, PRICE: </strong></p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quote. The price shall be evaluated to determine fair and reasonableness.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. This requirement will be evaluated considering delivery as most valuable, second consideration will be past performance and the last factor considered will be price.</p>
<p>Only e-mailed quotes will be accepted. Faxed and mailed quotes will not be accepted. E-mailed quotes may be sent to Emily Clark at Emily.L.Clark@uscg.mil.</p>

<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired. <br />(End of Clause)</p>

The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, consumables, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br /><br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Chad.B.Dais@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 1200 Pacific Time on 18MARCH2013..</p>

This information is REQUIRED in order for a sellers bid to be deemed 'responsive' and to be considered for award. <BR> <BR>For all buys other than Exact Match Sellers MUST document what they are bidding for evaluation for award.  Sellers must include, extended specs and/or manufacturer name and part numbers (if applicable).  Failure to do this may be cause for termination.  This information is REQUIRED in order for a sellers bid to be deemed 'responsive' and to be considered for award. FAR 52.211-6. <BR> <BR>Please provide all questions by 12:00 NOON EST Monday, March 4, 2013. <BR> <BR>QUESTION: Bilateral MRA with the European cooperation for the (EA).  This isn?t something that, to my know, exists any longer.  No US AB could fulfill that requirement, thus eliminating us all from the bid.  Participation in the ILAC MRA now satisfies that requirement. The EA bilateral agreement required that all ABs be non-profit and have no competition ? which is the case in the EU and many countries.  That is an impossibility in the US.  Competition eliminated all U.S. ABs whether you were a non-profit or not.  The participation in the ILAC MRA is all that is necessary.  The solution was for the EA to accept and participate in the ILAC MRA.  By doing so, the circumvention of the impossible requirement and restriction was bypassed.   Because competition is present in the US, any signee of the EA bilateral agreement was automatically in breach of the agreement.   Is this something we can have removed from the solicitation?
ANSWER: Reference to the EA has been removed from the SOW. <BR> <BR>QUESTION: The SOW refers to more information at the end of the document, but there is not such information at the end of the document: "...test methods under the chemical and mechanical test technologies or scopes of accreditation listed at the end of this document." Is there additional information that was left out or is there an additional attachment that is missing?
ANSWER: The attached document listing provides the chemical and mechanical technology scope for each laboratory. <BR> <BR>

These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product.

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly? (1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <BR> <BR>(2) [ ] Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database.

(i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or designated country end product, as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled ?Trade Agreements.? (ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products. List other End Products: <BR> <BR>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification.

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture.

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification.

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The Solicitation Number is HSCG38-13-R-H00006 and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) using the procedures of FAR 12 in conjunction with FAR 15. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-65.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Total Small Business Set-aside. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard is 336412 and the Small Business Size Standard is 1000 employees. All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. Proposals from large business sources will not be considered under this Total Small Business Set-aside acquisition.</p>
<p>The complete detailed Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) Structure is provided as a separate document, which offerors may use for their price proposal. The Statement of Work (SOW) is also provided as a separate document to this solicitation.</p>
<p>Description of the requirement: The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Elizabeth City, NC requires overhaul of the Hamilton Sundstrand 54H60-117 Propeller Assembly and related components. Overhaul work shall be performed in accordance with Air Force Technical Orders (AFTO's) listed in the SOW in section 3.3. The USCG ALC requires overhaul of the following items:</p>
<p>Propeller Assembly, P/N 54H60-117, NSN: 1610-01-096-7677 Quantity 24 each; <br />Valve Housing Assembly, P/N 714325-5 NSN:1610-01-016-2196, Quantity 10 each; <br />Pump Housing Assembly, P/N 733872-6 NSN: 1610-01-220-6052, Quantity 4 each; <br />Propeller Spinner, P/N 554665 NSN: 1610-00-873-6251, Quantity 2 each; <br />Propeller Synchronizer, P/N: 774800-1 NSN: 1610-01-128-7400, Quantity 4 each; <br />Afterbody Half Body P/N: 560501 NSN: 1610-00-873-6424, Quantity 4 each. <br /><br />The 54H60-117 Propeller Assembly is used on the USCG HC-130H aircraft. The contractor must possess all tools, parts, test equipment, facilities, technical data, and AFTOs, including AFTO updates, necessary to overhaul the propeller assemblies and related components. The USCG does not control the AFTO process, does not own and does not have the ability to release the AFTOs. The contractor must be able to obtain the most recent AFTOs including updates to the AFTO's. The source for AFTOs is provided in the SOW under section 3.6.</p>
<p>The contractor must be either a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Certified/Authorized Repair Station, a European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Approved Maintenance Organization, or a Transport Canada Civil Aviation Directorate (TCCA) Approved Maintenance Organization authorized to overhaul the 54H60 Propeller Assembly and related components. Possession of at least one (1) of these Certifications is a minimum requirement. The contractor shall also have the capability to perform cold rolling of individual blades as specified in the AFTO or the ability to obtain it in such a manner to meet the Delivery Schedule established in the SOW section 7.0.</p>
<p>The Propeller Assemblies and related components are considered to be Flight Critical, therefore an Airworthiness Certification is required for all overhauled equipment. The contractor may choose to use the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Form 8130 Airworthiness Certificate however the USCG does not require use of this form. An alternate Airworthiness Certification developed by the contractor using language and format either the same or similar as used for commercial customers under FAA regulations may be used in accordance with the SOW section 10.2.1.</p>
<p>The USCG intends to ship all of the equipment listed in the Schedule of Supplies/Services CLIN structure in one (1) shipment for overhaul and return to the USCG in accordance with the SOWs Delivery Schedule, however, due to the physical size of the Propeller Assembly offerors may propose the USCG employ a staggered shipping schedule for the Propeller Assemblies only beginning with a minimum of five (5) each providing the delivery schedule can be met. If a proposal does not propose a staggered shipping schedule it will be assumed the contractor can accept all of the equipment in one (1) single shipment. A staggered delivery schedule is acceptable for overhauled Propeller Assemblies, however, the minimum delivery requirement is five (5) each every 60 calendar days After Receipt of Material (ARM) at the Contractor's facility. Required delivery for all other items is 60 calendar days ARM at the Contractor's facility.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be made to the USCG Aviation Logistics Center, Receiving Bldg 63, Weeksville Road, Elizabeth City, NC 27909. Proposals shall be F.o.b. Destination shipping terms from the contractor's facility to Elizabeth City, NC. Accelerated and Aircraft of Ground (AOG) situations are addressed in the SOW in sections 7.2 and 7.3. Inspection and Acceptance shall be in accordance with FAR 52.212-4(a) and will performed by the USCG Aviation Logistics Center Quality Assurance Branch.</p>

<p><strong>FAR 52.211-14 Notice of Priority Rating for National Defense Use (Apr 2008)<br />FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (Feb 1998)<br /></strong>Full text of provisions clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far</p>
<p><strong>FAR 52.2-212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items (Jan 1999) is applicable to this acquisition. </strong></p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor I Technical Ability <br /><br />Factor II Quality Control System<br /><br />Factor III Past Performance <br /><br />Factor IV Price<br /><br />The above evaluation factors are listed in their order of importance. Non-price Factors when combined are more important than price.</p>
<p><strong>Factor I: Technical Ability<br /><br /></strong>Proposals shall describe in sufficient detail the offerors ability to perform the overhaul work in accordance with the requirements of the SOW with emphasis on addressing the ability to overhaul equipment in accordance with the required technical data including any updates to technical data that may be issued during contract performance, ability to meet cold rolling requirements, the offerors approach in providing an Airworthiness Certification on all overhauled equipment, and the offeror's approach to meet required delivery schedules.<br /><br /><strong>Factor II: Quality Control System</strong></p>
<p>Proposals shall describe in sufficient detail the offerors Quality Control System that will be used in performance of the contract with emphasis on inspection procedures, personnel involved in the inspection process including their qualifications and responsibilities, traceability of replacement parts to the original equipment manufacturer, warranty terms and duration, and address work that will be subcontracted including subcontractor qualifications and formal agreements between the offeror and subcontractors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Factor III: Past Performance<br /></strong><br />Past performance will be evaluated for a performance risk assessment and will consider the relevance and the quality of the contractor's past performance. Relevancy will consider the offeror's experience in overhauling the Hamilton Sundstrand 54H60 model Propeller Assembly. Quality of past performance will consider quality issues and their resolution, timeliness of delivery, and customer satisfaction. Attachment C to the SOW is an "OFFERORS PAST PERFORMANCE QUESTIONAIRE". Offerors must include a complete Questionaire with their proposal for three (3) customer references. The Government reserves the right to use past performance information obtained from other sources such as the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and Government personnel who are experienced with the offerors performance.</p>
<p><strong>Factor IV: Price</strong></p>
<p>Price will be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness. Prices that are extremely high or low in relation to the Government's estimate may be judged unrealistic and may indicate that the offeror has misunderstood the nature of the work to be performed. The Government intends to award a single contract for the overhaul of all equipment listed in the CLIN structure but reserves the right to break out CLINs and award more than one contract if determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Proposals shall price ALL CLINs to be considered complete.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision)<br /><br /><strong>FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Dec 2012</strong>) Offerors shall include a competed copy of this provision with its offer.

<p>&nbsp;NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

<DESC>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to the market survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<br /><br />The C2A1 canister is a component of mask systems that filters air to the user. Toxic liquid and solid materials are removed from the air via a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) grade filter media and gas phase toxins are removed downstream by a bed of ASZM-TEDA activated carbon. The combination of these two filter mechanisms effectively filters out all known Chemical Biological (CB) warfare agents, toxins and radioactive fallout particles. The C2A1 canister is used on many mask systems including the M40A1, M42A2, M45, M48, MCU-2A/P, JSAM MPU-5, and JSAM MPU-6 Masks.<br /><br /><br />

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide additional clarification to question #42 in the Presolicitation Conference Summary dated 05 March 2013 (see page 14 of 25). <br />Refer below:
<p>42. On similar solicitations the Department has precluded quality assurance and IV&amp;V contractors from teaming and or priming work that they are auditing due to a conflict of interest. Is the company that is currently conducting quality assurance for ERIC able to<br />participate as a prime or as a teaming partner?</p>
<p>The Department's response: No small business currently performing work on ERIC is prohibited from teaming or serving as the prime contractor. The prime contractor (large or small) working on ERIC is prohibited from teaming with a small business partner.</p>
<p>As a means to provide further clarification, let it be known that the Department is competing requirement erte10038b through a total small business set-aside.<br />Therefore, the proposed prime contractor for erte100038b must be a small business. Partnering or teaming between two firms for erte100038b is allowed; however, the firms that are partnering or teaming must be small businesses.</p>
<p>With regard to large businesses, a large business cannot compete for erte100038b as a prime contractor due to this requirement being set-aside for small businesses. A large business can only be a subcontractor to a small business for this requirement<br />on the condition that (1) the small business must perform at least 51 percent of the work in accordance with FAR 52.219-14, and (2) the proposed large business<br />subcontractor cannot perform more than 49 percent of the work required in the PWS.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment 0003 is extend the EXPRESSION OF INTEREST submission close date to 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 21, 2013.

Background:
In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors and acquiring a Rough-Order-Magnitude (ROM) of lifecycle price/cost for acquiring a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution for Configuration Management Automation (CMA).

This Market Survey announcement is a follow on to the CMA Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI), issued March 29, 2010.  This Market Survey builds upon and further refines this previous market research effort by elaborating on the requirements of the desired solution.  The FAA may use the information provided from this Market Survey as the basis for requests for one-on-one discussions or vendor solution demonstration.

The nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA will evaluate the responses to this Market Survey and will make further acquisition decisions based on those responses. The FAA envisions establishing a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with Labor Hour (LH) components with a vendor determined to be both responsible and responsive to the needs of the FAA.  A FFP/LH contract provides for payment of hardware/software and the labor to install and integrate the solution, to the extent prescribed. 

At this time the nature of the final competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  Small business participation is highly encouraged.  

The FAA anticipates a SIR will be issued during February 2014.  This Market Survey conveys the potential agency need and seeks sources capable of providing the desired functional capabilities described herein and associated pricing/cost information. Responses will assist the FAA in further developing the acquisition strategy for CMA.  All information provided in response to this Market Survey may be subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Information considered proprietary or confidential must be clearly marked as such.  Any information not identified as proprietary or confidential will be used at the FAAs discretion and may be publicly released without further FOIA disclosure review by the FAA or respondent(s).

PURPOSE:
The primary goals of this Market Survey are to: 
1.	Identify available enterprise level solutions in the market place that could meet the FAAs requirements for CMA;
2.	Provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition;
3.	Obtain vendor pricing/cost information for the full lifecycle of the CMA solution. Pricing/cost information should include various options and pricing/cost structures available; 
4.	Identify potential technical approaches for the development of a solution which will meet the CMA requirements; 
5.	Provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.
6.	Obtain industry insight regarding acquisition, implementation, and support strategies for CMA; and
7.	Obtain additional industry insight regarding other CMA solutions and benefits not currently captured in the requirements.

STATEMENT OF NEED:
The FAA has a requirement for a new CMA solution.  The current FAA Configuration Management (CM) legacy systems, Web Change Management (WebCM) and Replacement Document and Configuration Identification (RepCON), do not effectively and efficiently incorporate evolving changes within the Agency due to a lack of flexibility and scalability. WebCM was implemented in 2005 for managing proposed changes to Configuration Items (CI)s in the National Airspace System (NAS) environment.  RepCON is an in-house developed tool designed to provide automated CM support, collect NAS configuration data and associated status, and maintain the as-is NAS configuration. These two existing CM systems do not provide a true full lifecycle management solution, since both systems are primarily utilized during the in-service management phase. The lack of an automated, flexible CM solution, has limited the efficiency and effectiveness of an enterprise-level CM solution. The current CM architecture modifications needed are both costly and time-consuming, while functional capabilities needed to meet operational goals are not feasible.

CMA will provide an automated, integrated enterprise solution to support CM of NAS and Non-NAS Information Technology (IT) assets and investments, encompass and expand the functionality and data of legacy CM tools, and make available a single point of access providing insight and traceability to the configuration baselines reflected in the FAA Enterprise Architecture (EA). 

CMA will be comprised of functional capabilities for CM, Business Process Management (BPM), data and content management, lifecycle management, with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) platform for interfacing with other Non-NAS IT systems.

CMA will provide the additional required CM capability and will result in   enhanced safety, information security, cost control, data accessibility, product supportability, process improvement, and performance metrics. The acquisition of a CMA solution will allow for a flexible, robust solution that has the capability to incorporate necessary changes for today and as the Agency continues to transition to Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). 

CMA Capabilities Required:
	Full Lifecycle Traceability: CMA will interface with key CM-related Agency systems to provide a closed-loop CM environment with full lifecycle traceability as defined in the AMS, i.e., during mission analysis, investment analysis, solution implementation and in-service management. 

	Real-Time Information: CMA will enable the capability for all CM Stakeholders to access real-time, accurate, site-specific CM information when it is needed, including essential information from other primary data sources.  This will be accomplished via interfaces to other Agency systems and enterprise toolsets.

	Manage the Growing and Increasingly Complex CM-Related Data:  CMA will focus on meeting needs to address the Agencys escalating challenges in managing the growing and increasingly complex amount of data required throughout the AMS program lifecycle; thereby enabling compliance to Agency CM and Acquisition policies.  

	Seamless Integration: CMA will incorporate seamless integration with other related processes and information, allowing the Agency to effectively manage established and future business rules.  This will support moving the Agency to a scalable, network-centric architecture that will ensure that everyone using CMA has easy access to the same information at the same time.  CMA will make available a single point of access providing insight and traceability of configuration baselines to the as-is and the to-be views reflected in the FAA EA. 

	Effective and Efficient CM Processes: CMA will facilitate the development of loosely coupled processes across the FAA to plan and manage the transition from current capabilities to NextGen.  Loosely coupled processes and workflows will provide the foundation for future process improvement efforts, resulting in Agency advancements in CM flexibility and scalability.

	Integrate and Automate Processes and Tools: The FAA Destination 2025 vision identifies safety, a skilled and dedicated workforce, innovation, sustainability and global collaboration as being top priorities for the Agency.  CMA will enable decision makers and stakeholders to effectively manage assets using current, accurate and easily accessible CM data, enabling effective portfolio management.

Benefits:
	Cost Savings:  CMA will encompass the existing functionality of RepCON, WebCM, and other legacy CM tools used by the Agency Lines of Business, thereby reducing the cost related to the legacy systems sustainment activities. CMA will also provide many opportunities for cost avoidance associated with timely, decision-making and efficient data accessibility and availability. 

	Policy Adherence:  The Agencys CM Policy, FAA Order 1800.66, prescribes that CM shall apply to all systems, subsystems and components of the NAS and Non-NAS IT.  CMA will provide an automated, integrated enterprise solution to support the Agencys CM of all segments of the FAA EA. The current legacy systems are primarily utilized during in-service management; however, CMA will provide a true lifecycle management solution to include all phases of systems and programs lifecycle as defined in the AMS.  The proper application of CM at an enterprise-level and throughout the lifecycle will support the Agencys ongoing mission to successfully transition to the NextGen. 

Assumptions:
	The CMA solution shall be flexible and scalable allowing the FAA to easily adapt to future CM demands.

	Current technology shall provide more functionality at a lower cost than the Agencys legacy systems.

	The CMA solution shall improve the performance of time-consuming manual operations by providing increased agility for automated CM processes and tools.

	The CMA solution shall improve the efficiency and effectiveness of current automated operations.

	The CMA solution shall allow establishment of process improvement initiatives and industry best practices.

	The CMA solution shall be a non-proprietary system.

The CMA solution shall contain these capabilities and be provided by an industry standard CM COTS solution.

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NO SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Program Manager Air (PMA) 226 is the United States Navy program office responsible for total life cycle support of the CH-46E helicopter. The CH-46E will be operated through 2016 by the United States Marine Corps; however, it is anticipated that aircraft and component repair/overhaul support will be required beyond 2016 by other U.S. Federal Agencies and/or foreign militaries. To achieve the support required beyond 2016, PMA-226 is seeking to identify potential industry partners that can provide these services. Specifically, this RFI is seeking information regarding possible vendors that can provide repair/overhaul of the components listed in Attachment 1.</p>
<p>Description of Services:</p>
<p>Overhaul/Repair of CH-46E helicopter components to include the labor and material necessary to accomplish the overhaul/repair of the items listed in Attachment 1.</p>
<p>The components will be repaired in accordance with the applicable United States Navy (USN) Component Maintenance Manuals; and/or Source Drawings; and/or Original Equipment Manufacturers' (OEM) functional specifications.</p>
<p>These services may also include receiving, handling, transportation, performance test, functional test, and associated inspections. Scheduled and unscheduled depot level maintenance, analytical condition inspection, and maintenance data systems management may also be required.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 488190; Other Support Activities for Air Transportation, and the Product Service Code (PSC) encompass both J015; Maintenance/Repair of Aircraft and J028; Maintenance/Repair of Engines.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>All responsible sources interested in providing these services are requested to provide a written summary of information concerning their technical certifications/qualifications, capabilities, facilities, equipment, experience (both domestic and with foreign militaries, if applicable), and corporate background. The summary should also include a description of potential approaches and plans to acquire or establish capability for review by the Government. Vendors shall also indicate whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business or women-owned small business under NAICS 488190.

"As you know, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 mandates across-the-board spending cuts (known as sequestration) be ordered on March 1, 2013. As required by the law, the President issued a sequestration order canceling billions in budgetary resources across the Federal government for the remainder of the Federal fiscal year. 
At this time, the Agency is taking every step practicable to mitigate the effects of these cuts. However, but based on the magnitude of these mandated cuts, there will be impacts on current contract awards as well as current and future planned acquisitions. For example, the Agency may decide not to exercise options or may need to negotiate lower prices or other terms via bilateral modifications to meet the constraints imposed by the sequestration. The Agency may also determine it necessary to stop or suspend work, reduce the scope of work, or partially or completely terminate existing contracts for the government's convenience. Additionally, planned contract actions for new work may be rescoped, delayed, or canceled depending on the nature of the work and the degree to which it directly supports the Agency's critical mission needs and goals." Refer to the Special Notice posted on fbo.gov under EPA_SEQ_3-05-2013 for more information. 
Long-Term Remedial Action, Operation & Maintenance of a groundwater extraction system on the Continental Steel Superfund Site, Operable Unit 1. The Continental Steel Superfund Site is located in Kokomo, Indiana. The prospective contractor will be required to provide operation and maintenance of the groundwater extraction system and to perform analytical sampling. The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor and services in support of the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS).

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

The source(s) of these materials may include a variety of project sites across the United States including Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) sites, Superfund sites, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) sites, and other sites where the Army Corps of Engineers has cleanup execution authority.  <br>    <br>  Transportation methods typically include use of bulk containers and transport via truck, rail, or a combination of truck and rail.  Empty bulk containers are transported to the project site and are loaded by the government (or designee) for transport to the disposal facility.  Trans-loading of materials containerized in appropriate DOT packages during transport to the disposal facility (e.g., transfer of closed intermodal containers from truck to rail) is generally acceptable.  Trans-loading of loose materials from one DOT package to another (e.g., transferring material from and end dump truck to a rail gondola) is sometimes acceptable and is subject to government review and approval prior to implementation.  During such review consideration is given for permits /licenses and physical/engineering controls proposed or in place to minimize or eliminate potential for spills or other loss of material.  <br>    <br>  This Sources Sought Notice is to determine the capability of potential sources and the availability of commercial sources and services pursuant to FAR Part 10.

<p>This contract was competetively awarded using a Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contract. A CPFF contract type is appropriate for this case because the totality of the effort cannot be described in sufficient detail to allow for use of any other contract. Costs/revenues that cannot be reasonably determined include the following: Infrastructure changes required by U.S. and overseas banking regulation changes, revenues based on foreign exchange rate fluctuations, revenues based on interest rate fluctuations, facilities availability due to changes in facility renovation schedules (facilities requirements are the responsibility of the host military activity), model bank renovation expenses, operating expenses based on customer usage (e.g., card processing , checking/savings account charges, payment order charges, wire transfer fees, return check charges, etc.).</p>

		Memorandum


Date:	January 14, 2013
From:	Kristine Hostetler, Contract Specialist, CMOP Tucson, Arizona 
Subj:	Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition

I. The following information is provided to request a contract with R/X Automation Solutions (RXAS) for a semi-automatic bottle opening system to support the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) program. 
(1)	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition."
The Department of Veterans Affairs, National Acquisition Center is procuring a semi-automatic bottle opening system to support the CMOP program.  
(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. 
A new contract is requested for a sole source semi-automatic bottle opening system (Bulkmaster) to improve CMOP production output and decrease costs.  The equipment is not on FSS or other VA contracts. This equipment is new and does not replace currently owned equipment. 
 (3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). 
The proposed action is to provide and install a semi-automatic bottle opening system at the CMOP facility located in Murfreesboro, TN. The estimated value is $224,210.  
	(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open 	competition. 
Citations:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. 
(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. 
RXAS is the original designer and currently the only vendor of a highly specialized commercial off-the-shelf prescription drug bulk-up system designed to discharge and process the contents of fully-closed bottles at a high speed.  The BulkMaster is designed to open a wide range of HDPE bottle sizes and shapes used in the CMOP production process.   The BulkMaster is a proven system that is already in operation and fully tested at other commercial pharmaceutical dispensing facilities (Walgreens, Medline and Wal-Mart) and two other CMOP facilities (Hines and Leavenworth).  
The BulkMaster system is compatible with the CMOP production process protocols and is able to be integrated seamlessly with the CMOP high speed production equipment.  Currently, four pharmacy technicians manually process approximately 150-200 bottles per hour.  Hand dispensing introduces staff challenges including repetitive injuries, dispensing errors, and pill loss or contamination.  The BulkMaster system increases the process up to 900 bottles per hour with only two staff required.  Pharmacy technicians using the BulkMaster only load the bottles onto the feed table.  This reduced staff/machine  interaction virtually eliminates repetitive injuries, dispensing errors and pill loss or contamination. This also allows two pharmacy technicians to be assigned to the packing and labeling stations.  The combined benefit from integrating the BulkMaster into the CMOP production system is a 200% increase of prescription medications produced for the veterans and potentially cutting the time for delivery by a full day.    
(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.
Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, it was determined that competition is limited to RXAS.  A Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract will be issued using FedBizOpps.
 (7) A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. 
As the contracting officer, I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on an evaluation of other than cost or pricing data which includes, but is not limited to, a comparison of offered prices to prior prices, an evaluation of commercial catalogs and published price lists, or a comparison of prices RXAS charges and the discounts they give, if any, to their commercial customers. 
   (8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.
A Sources Sought Notice (VA797M-13-I-0046) was issued on 15 November 2012 with two responses received. Only RXAS can provide a COTS semi-automatic bottle opening system readily available to meet the CMOP program requirements. A search on SAM, VetBiz, and GSA eLibrary for NAICS 333993 (Packaging Machinery Manufacturing) was completed and several small businesses were discovered.  It was determined that no other company can provide a solution without a custom development.
(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:
(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. 
Not applicable.  The Statement of Work has been developed and is incorporated into the solicitation VA797M-13-R-0069.
(ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.
Not applicable.
(iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.
Not applicable.
(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
R/X Automation Systems and Calvary Automation Systems expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
 (11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.
The Government requires a COTS system.  Future acquisitions will be procured on a competitive basis if other contractors can provide a COTS product.

?
CERTIFICATION
I hereby certify that the foregoing Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is complete and current to the best of my knowledge and belief:
