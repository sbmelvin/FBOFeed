<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of Information Display System 4th Generation (IDS4) software, for installation at the Boise ATCT.  The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Systems Atlanta Inc of Lebanon, GA, in accordance with Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.4, Single Source Selection.
The new IDS4 system at Boise is required to connect to one of the existing networks. It also must interface with DASI, FDIO, NOTAM, RVR, and AWIPS systems (one of each will be acquired through this acquisition). IDS software required for this task is proprietary to Systems Atlanta and cannot be obtained elsewhere.  Because of the time, effort and expenditure of funds required to develop compatible hardware and software it is not appropriate for FAA to develop competition for this requirement.  This announcement is for information purposes only, not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal.  Point of contact is Alex Seguin, 425-227-2687, or alex.seguin@faa.gov.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Surface Transportation Board (STB) is soliciting for requests for fixed-priced proposals from offerors with the expertise necessary to build the Government a complete, accurate and confidential Master Waybill File and Public Use File. The Carload Waybill Sample is a sample of waybills for terminated shipments by rail carriers. The Government requires that railroads submit waybill sample data if, in any of the three preceding years, the railroad terminated at least 4,500 revenue car loads on its line.

The Waybill Sample identifies originating and terminating freight stations, the
names of all railroads participating in the movement, the point of all railroad
interchanges, the number of cars, the car types, movement weight in hundredweight, the
commodity and the freight revenue. The names of the shipper and consignee may be part
of the railroad's data submission, but are not included in the final sample data.

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the Surface Transportation Board (STB) will award one (1) fixed-priced contract to the offeror that represents the best overall value to the Government in accordance with FAR Part 15 Contract by Negotiations. The period of performance will be one (1) base year from the date of award with four (4) one-year options executed after the base year upon approval by the Government.

<DESC>The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a Federal Corporation created under Title VI of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2004. The MCC has a requirement for independent evaluations of its programs from recognized experts in the field of economic development research using the most rigorous methods practicable. <br /><br />All qualified firms are encouraged to submit a proposal.&nbsp; This solicitation is open&nbsp;to small and large businesses.
<p>All existing MCC contract holders for impact evaluation services&nbsp;are required to&nbsp;submit proposals if your organization desires to continue to compete for new impact evaluation task orders. The MCC desires to have all contract holders with the same period of performance and new task orders will only be&nbsp;competed among awardees from this solicitation.</p>
<p>MCC is seeking to obtain services from firms to conduct independent evaluations of MCC programs, projects, and activities proposed by eligible countries; provide technical assistance to MCC and country staff to carry out required data collection; and contribute knowledge to the broader development community about the effectiveness of development programs.</p>
<p>In addition, the firms may be required to provide technical assistance in a variety of areas in carrying out evaluations in response to long-term and short-term task assignments. Experience with the methodology of randomized trials is required as well as quasi-experimental designs and the application of those methodologies in developing countries.</p>
<p>MCC classifies its impact evaluations according to two broad categories. Category 1 impact evaluations are conducted by constructing credible counterfactual scenarios using experimental or quasi-experimental designs, with the most credible being random selection of treatment and control groups. A Category 1 evaluation typically will commence near the beginning of a compact to give evaluators the opportunity to work closely with MCC staff and project implementers to obtain data during the project's life.</p>
<p>If a credible counterfactual scenario cannot be established, then MCC will conduct a Category 2 impact evaluation of a project or activity. Category 2 evaluations may commence near the beginning of a compact, during a compact, or after all compact activities are complete.&nbsp; Although it may not be possible to establish a counterfactual via control or comparison groups, Category 2 evaluations will use the most rigorous methodology possible to assess whether the projected results have been achieved.</p>

<DESC>The National Park Service is seeking quotations for the recordation of 14 mine sites with 26 openings located in Joshua Tree National Park, CA.  The purpose of the project work is to gather and record basic information about the specific historic mines/openings so Park management can make informed decisions regarding closures.  Some of the Park's mines have been evaluated for National Register of Historic Places status and have been listed or determined eligible.  Work conducted under this project will follow the level of recording outlined in a Programmatic Agreement in place for California national parks and will require the contractor to identify staging area(s) to best avoid impacts to the cultural resources at these mines, define the area of potential effect (APE) and produce a base recording of the mine openings and features in the immediate area.  All fieldwork and draft site records for the first 7 mines identified in the Scope of Work must be completed by December 31, 2009.
Joshua Tree National Park is located in Riverside and San Bernardino counties in southeastern California.  The Scope of Work provided in the Request for Quotation (RFQ) contains the location of all 14 mine sites within the park.  The study and conservation work shall be performed in accordance with the Scope of Work and under the authority and requirements of the Archeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, as amended (P.L. 96-95); the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (P.L. 96-515); and other guidelines as identified within.  
Award selection will be made to the responsible offeror whose quotation represents the "best value" to the Government after consideration of technical capability and price.  For the purpose of this acquisition, technical capability is more important than price.  In addition to other criteria noted in the RFQ, the Contractor shall possess an advanced degree in anthropology and have considerable experience in that field of study.  The offeror must be able to demonstrate that they have long-term experience recording historic mines, identifying APE's, and should have experience providing public land managing agencies with reliable and detailed documentation.  
The RFQ will be made available for download on or about October 15, 2009 at http://www.fbo.gov or directly from the Department of Interior site at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  Contractor's are responsible for periodically checking the site for any Amendments that may be issued prior to the closing date of the RFQ.
This project is being funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), and the contractor must meet all reporting requirements as described in FAR 52.204-11.  The Contractor shall report the required information using the online reporting tool available at www.FederalReporting.gov. 
This acquisition is unrestricted.  All responsible and qualified sources may submit a response which, if timely received, will be considered.  The NPS welcomes the participation of small, minority, women, and disabled veteran owned business enterprises capable of fulfilling this requirement.

<DESC>RECOVERYNational Park Service, Department of Interior, intends to negotiate a sole source Architect-Engineering Services Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Gray & Osborne, Inc., 3710 168th Street NE, Bldg B, Arlington WA 98223 to acquire the below listed services.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541310, size standard $4,500,00.00.
Gray & Osborne is currently providing design and construction documents for the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (LEKT) wastewater collection system and connection of this system to the City of Port Angeles (City) sewer system.  Upon City approval to accept the County residential wastewater, the County wastewater collection system will be facilitated by extending the LEKT wastewater collection system to service the County residences and properties. Gray & Osborne possesses institutional knowledge of the required submittals and processes with the City, County, and Tribe to not duplicate of efforts, time or cost. They also have an institutional knowledge crucial for preparation of the design and construction documents for the connecting system since it is the same type and unique design of a vacuum assisted system. Gray & Osborne has accumulated a body of knowledge and expertise concerning the site and system that is considered vital during the contracting and construction phases of this project as potential bidders and the eventual contractor will require clarifications regarding the basis of design and, potentially, value engineering proposals that will require prompt and accurate responses grounded in a firm understanding of the site's conditions and the design parameters on which the construction documents are based. Gray & Osborne is the only source that can respond to requests for information and review submittals in a timely manner without duplicating effort to ensure that all aspects of the specifications and drawings are addressed appropriately. They are also the only source that can continue the design of the connecting system without duplicating efforts and cost. 
The intent for this IDIQ contract is to provide architect and engineering services to include engineering analysis, survey, design and consultation services for preparation of the wastewater collection system design and construction documents as well as services throughout construction for the referenced projects.  Work shall include engineering analysis and design of the wastewater collection system for the referenced Clallam County residences and properties.  The engineering design services may require land and topographic survey in order to provide complete construction documents.  In addition, work may also include Title III engineering services and consultation throughout construction. 
This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures of FAR 5.201 and 6.302.  The subsequent contract will be negotiated in accordance with FAR 36.606 and FAR Part 15.  The Government believes that the identified contractor is the "only one responsible source" as defined by FAR 6.302-1 for the required Architect-Engineering services.  Firms that believe they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice to the Contracting Officer.
Primary Services Required: Architect-Engeering services for wastewater collection system design and construction documents.  Provide submittal review including specifications, review shop drawings, samples, diagrams, layouts, schematics, descriptive literature, illustrations, schedules, performance and test data, and similar materials furnished by the construction contractor to explain in detail specific portions of the work required by the contract.  Review and recommend approval or rejection of all submittals after thorough review of the construction documents and applicable standards and codes.  Verify conformance with the drawings and specifications.  Perform required design changes, including design sketches, perform cost estimating, review modifications and claims for additional compensation, prepare as-constructed drawings, analyze construction schedules, review value engineering proposals, provide customized operations manual for the plant operator, and assist with final inspection.  Required Disciplines:  Architectural, Landscape Architectural, Civil Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Structural Engineer, Geotechnical Engineer, and Cost Estimator.  Incidental services of CADD drafting and work processing may be required.
Firms believing they can provide the required services must provide supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements via submission of Standard Form 330, Parts 1 and II.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 30 days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<a href="mailto:fuller.elizabeth@epa.gov">ELIZABETH E. FULLER</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Superfund Remediation Technology and Innovation (OSRTI) Analytical Services Branch (ASB) has a requirement for Multi-Level, Multi-Matrix Organic Sample Analyses. This requirement will provide a contractual framework for qualified laboratories to apply EPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) analytical methods for determining the presence and concentration of specified organic sample analytes. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380 with a U.S. Small Business Administration defined size standard of $12 million. This acquisition will be partially set-aside for small business concerns.
This requirement will satisfy a need for qualified laboratories to apply EPA CLP analytical methods for the isolation, detection, and quantitative measurement of 52 volatile, 67 semivolatile, 21 pesticide, and 9 Aroclor target compounds in water and soil/sediment samples. Analyses are performed using Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) and Gas Chromatograph/Electron Capture Detector (GC/ECD). The EPA intends to award multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contracts with a one-year base period and two one-year option periods to meet the EPA's anticipated analytical needs using the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation. 
Detailed information on the analytical requirements is provided via the Organic (SOM01.2) SOW and its associated exhibits/appendices which are posted to the following web page: (http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/clp/som1.htm). The SOM01.2 SOW is a protocol that will define the organic methods and procedures accepted by the CLP.
The EPA has identified a need to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual and potential contractor conflicts of interest (COI).  It is imperative that the organic CLP contractors be beyond reproach and free from any improper influence or bias, as the potential for conflict could dramatically erode public confidence in EPA?s ability to accomplish its mission of protecting human health and the environment.
As a result, an offeror who is a SMO (Sample Management Office), ESAT (Environmental Services Assistance Team), or QATS (Quality Assurance and Technical Support) contractor at the time of CLP contract award will be ineligible for award of a CLP contract.  An offeror that has a significant financial interest in or business relationship with a SMO, ESAT and/or QATS contractor which cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated by time of award will also be ineligible for award of a CLP contract.  
The following provisions and clauses will be included in the solicitation and resulting contract(s) to avoid COI and awarding a CLP contract to an ineligible offeror:
A. Solicitation Stage
	To mitigate significant potential for COI the following provisions will appear in the CLP solicitation.
Section K - ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION (EPAAR 1552.209-72) (APR 1984)
  Section L- ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST NOTIFICATION (EPAAR 1552.209-70) (APR 1984)
Section L- CONFLICT OF INTERST PLAN (LOCAL LC-09-04) (DEC 2001)
Section L- DISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Section M- EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS FOR AVOIDING OR MITIGATING AN EXISTING SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST
The solicitation will require the offeror to identify any financial interests in or business relationships with the Sample Management Office (SMO) contractor, the Quality Assurance Technical Services (QATS) contractor or and Environmental Services Assistance Team (ESAT) contractor. If the EPA determines that financial interest or a business relationship with such a contractor creates an actual or significant potential conflict of interest that cannot reasonably be avoided, neutralized,or mitigated, the offeror will be ineligible for award. Furthermore, an offeror that currently has a SMO, QATS, or ESAT contract at the time of contract award will be ineligible for CLP contract award. 
Section M - EVALUATION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN (LOCAL LRT-09-05) (DEC 2001) DEVIATION
 The plan described in Section L.14 entitled "CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN" will be evaluated as acceptable or not acceptable.  Notwithstanding any other evaluation of the offeror's proposal, an offeror that submits a plan that is unacceptable at the time of award will not be eligible for a contract award.
Solicitation Attachment (to be determined) - MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR EPA CONTRACTORS? CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLANS
B.  Contract Management Stage
The contract will require the contractor to certify annually that no conflicts or potential conflicts of interest exist, or that they have been disclosed or mitigated.  In addition, the contractor must certify that all personnel who are to perform work under a task order have been informed of their obligation to report any personal or organizational COI, and that the contractor understands its continuing obligation to search for and to report any COI.  The solicitation and resultant contract will also contain the following COI contract clauses.  
Section H- ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (EPAAR 1552.209-71) (MAY 1994)
Section H- NOTIFICATION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST REGARDING PERSONNEL (EPAAR 1552.209-73) (MAY 1994)
Section H- LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING (HEADQUARTERS SUPPORT)  (EPAAR 1552.209-74) (OCT 2005) ALTERNATE V (APR 2004)
Section H ? ANNUAL CERTIFICATION (EPAAR 1552.209-75) (MAY 1994)  Section H ? PROJECT EMPLOYEE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT (EPAAR 1552.227-76) (MAY 1994) (End of Provisions and Clauses)
During the contract period of performance, the contractor will be required to continue monitoring for potential or actual COI. The contractor is required to report any COI that may arise, as it is made aware of the issue. This includes both at the organizational level and the personal, employee level. In addition to reporting the COI as they arise, the contractor is required to submit an annual certification to the Contracting Officer, stating that the contractor has disclosed all potential or actual COI and that employees have been informed of their obligation to report COI to the contractor.
Furthermore, any CLP contractor will be restricted during the life of the CLP contract, absent advance written approval by the cognizant contracting officer, from entering into a SMO, ESAT, or QATS contract, from entering into a contract with a SMO, ESAT, or QATS contractor, or from having a significant financial interest in or business relationship with a SMO, ESAT, or QATS contractor. 
Offerors will be evaluated on factors which include Past Performance, Pre-Award Performance Evaluation Sample, Contract Compliance Screening Audit, Quality Assurance Plan, Key Personnel and Pre-Award Onsite Laboratory Audit. Offerors will be required to request Pre-Award Performance Evaluation Samples from the Contracting Officer by the date specified in the solicitation. In an effort to streamline the procurement process and to utilize electronic communication to the maximum extent possible, the solicitation, amendments, and other related items for this procurement will be posted at this website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod. Solicitation PR-HQ-09-12542 will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about October 29, 2009.
Interested parties are required to download the RFP and all related documents from the aforementioned website and to monitor it regularly for status updates. No printed copies of the RFP will be available. All questions regarding this solicitation shall be submitted in writing to Ms. Elizabeth Fuller, Contract Specialist, at fuller.elizabeth@epa.gov and Mr. Keith Upah, Contracting Officer, at upah.keith@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Nadya L Popil, Contracting Officer, Phone 215-446-5761, Fax 215-446-6185, Email nadya.popil@gsa.gov
<DESC>RECOVERY - The responsible contractor selected for this project will be required to develop an Innovative Facilities (IF) Online Environment which will provide information to interested users of the United States General Services Administration (GSA), as well as other governmental agencies and private sector developers to support decision making regarding sustainable building principles, materials and systems. 

The online environment will assist GSA in delivering world class work environments to tenant agencies and supports the requirement in the Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007 for the GSA Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings to establish green practices that can be used throughout the life of a Federal facility.

The requirement includes the development of an online environment, which will offer the following:

a. Provide information and resources to support decision making regarding sustainable building principles, materials and systems; 
b. Enhance skill sets to assess lease submittals and architect/engineering design team deliverables; 
c. Promote the use of energy efficient and environmentally preferable materials and systems in GSA leases, renovations, and alterations; 
d. Provide sustainable design support for work place initiatives; and 
e. Support existing GSA green leasing initiatives.  


This project shall be awarded with a firm fixed price (FFP) contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. For this requirement, the combined weight of the technical evaluation factors is considered significantly more important than price. 

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the best value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.   

The below factors are listed in descending order of importance:
a. 	Technical Approach
b. 	Past Performance
c. 	Key Personnel

The combined technical factors of Past Performance and Key Personnel are of equal importance to Technical Approach.  In addition, the three (3) combined technical factors (Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Key Personnel) are significantly more important than Price. 

The NAICS code applicable to this project is 541511 (Webpage Design Services, Custom). Per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 36.204, the range for this project is estimated between $100,000 and $500,000. This unrestricted procurement is being conducted under full and open competitive provisions in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. 
 
Contractors interested in obtaining a copy of the solicitation package will be able to download electronic copies of the Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about October 30, 2009 on (www.fbo.gov). All questions must be submitted via email to nadya.popil@gsa.gov. All other forms of communication will not be considered. 
 
A pre-proposal conference will be held on or about November 4, 2009. This conference shall be held via conference call. Conference call information will be provided with the RFP.

This will require the successful offeror to first grid FOB Denver (located 1.0 hour from main NTC post, terrain-rough, with specific location to be determined, and establish the infrastructure. The power plant or microgrid will be configured for power to be delivered based on actual demand, not peak demand for the overall system. Design will allow for the future addition of renewable energy (solar, wind, and/or battery storage).  The selected offeror will be required to provide all necessary tools, materials, and equipment and qualified labor to install a 1MW power generation system connected to the grid, inclusive of underground cabling, step down and step up transformers, panel boxes as necessary as well as paralleling gear with load sequencing capabilities (turning on/off generators). The power distribution system or microgrid will provide 480vac, 208vac, and 110/120vac to meet all power requirements.  In order to be eligible for award, prices must be submitted on for all major components to each line item.  Failure to submit pricing detail for all major components/categories may cause rejection of the offer.  Proposals will be evaluated for completeness in satisfying the requirements of the RFP. The proposals will be ranked on the basis of the following factors: (a) past performance and experience, (b) technical ability (comprised of contractor submitted proprietary drawings, contractor furnished equipment/product listings/catalogs), (c) management plan, with locations of the offerors primary place of business and field offices, (d) mobilization/ set up schedule, (e) extent of subcontracting, and (f) price.  Technical ability is slightly more important than past performance and experience, mobilization/set-up schedules, both of which are of equal weight and more important than the extent of subcontracting.  The technical factors when combined are more important that price; however, price remains a significant factor. This is an unrestricted procurement.  The applicable NAICS code is 221119, with a size standard of 4 million megawatt hours, (a firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and/or distribution of electric energy for sale and its total electric output for the preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours). The solicitation will be issued on, or about, 10 July 2009 with proposals due by 3:30 p.m., local time, 11 August 2009.  Hard copy quotes are to be delivered to the Corps of Engineers, Wanamaker Building, Room 643, 100 Penn Square East, Philadelphia, PA 19107-3390 ATTN: Mr. Edward A. Boddie.  Solicitation documents, plans and specifications will only be available via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) homepage located at https://www.fbo.gov/.   Offerors may view and/or download the solicitation and all amendments from the Internet on (or after) the issue date. Registration for plans and specs should be made via FBO Internet homepage.  Hardcopies will not be available and no written or fax requests will be accepted.  If any offeror information changes during the advertisement period, offerors are responsible to make changes to their user profile on the Internet. Failure to make changes in their user profile may cause a delay in receiving the solicitation and any amendments. Offerors are responsible for printing paper copies of the solicitation. Bonding is not required.  All offerors must be registered in the DoDs Central Contract Register before award, as required by DFARS 204.7300 and, for US firms, must comply with VETS-100 annual reporting as required by FAR 22.1310(b).

<DESC>Research and Development Sources Sought
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS announcement. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.</p>
<p>Description: The 705 Combat Training Squadron (CTS), Kirtland AFB, NM is seeking small business Statements of Capability (SOC) for its technical support requirements in support of the Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC), Kirtland AFB, NM. <br />Background: The mission of the 705 CTS is to "develop, integrate, and deliver a virtual Air, Space, and Cyber environment for Air Force, Joint, and Coalition combat training, test, and experimentation." This mission requires the 705 CTS to maintain a highly-qualified staff of government and contractor personnel with expertise in exercise design and execution, weapons systems integration and interoperability and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) technology development. Since the Air Force inherited Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities from the Identification Friend, Foe, or Neutral Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E) in 1990, the mission and capabilities of the DMOC, have undergone significant change. One of the major drivers in this change was the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) endorsement of the DMO vision in 2004. DMO promotes the use of advanced M&amp;S capabilities as a realistic means to connect Command, Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) assets and combat systems to test and train on modern tactics, particularly during times of high Operations Tempo (OPSTEMPO). Furthermore, training and testing transformation initiatives within the Department of Defense (DoD) will continue to have a major influence on the DMOC. Since 2005, the DMOC has experienced a significant growth in mission requirements and in staffing levels to achieve the DMO vision established by CSAF. The 705 CTS anticipates continued expansion of the DMOC mission primarily in the areas of seamlessly integrating the Theater Air Control System (TACS) at the operational and tactical levels of warfare, providing robust joint and coalition training, controlled interface and Multi-National Information Sharing (MNIS) operations, testing in realistic operational environments, integrating live and simulation environments, and experimenting with advanced weapons systems and evolving Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).</p>
<p>Utilizing the DMOC and associated resources, the 705 CTS performs training, tests, and experimentation with military personnel operating live weapon systems and high fidelity simulations in a dense synthetic environment. DMOC resources include simulations of airborne systems; surveillance systems; airborne and ground command, control and communication systems; Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs); voice communications systems, data link systems; data loggers; network analysis tools; and intelligence systems. The battlespace is currently capable of simulating up to 50,000 simultaneous air and ground objects. Digital terrain databases include Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED), Digital Feature Analysis Data (DFAD), and Controlled Image Base (CIB) imagery. Standards for Electronic Warfare and weather effects are under development and may be modeled.</p>
<p>The DMOC is linked to a large number of military and contractor simulation facilities through point-to-point and wide area networks. Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), High Level Architecture (HLA) and Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) gateways and corresponding network components allow the DMOC to interface with a variety of joint Live Virtual - Constructive (LVC) simulation facilities. Translators are available to allow exchange of tactical data link messages between actual field equipment and simulation models.</p>
<p>Objective: The offeror shall provide technical and analytical expertise for the execution of DMOC training events, tests, and experimentation activities and system development in support of battlespace operations. This effort includes program management and engineering support tasks. Contract deliverables will include, but will not be limited to, technical exercise plans, test schedules, acceptance test plans and reports, after action reports, technical reports, study reports, controlled interface and Multi-National Information Sharing (MNIS) ruleset and risk assessment documents, engineering analysis reports, engineering drawings, system, and technical architectures; simulation interoperability standards and technical schematics.</p>
<p>Based on current trends the estimated labor total for this scope of work is 42,000 hours per year.</p>
<p>Mission Areas:</p>
<p>Efforts under this synopsis for the required support have been broken into six Primary Mission Areas (examples provided are not exhaustive):<br />1) Internal Training Events - DMOC internal training events include major exercise events such as Virtual Flag (VF) and smaller scale training events such as Warfighter Focused Events (WFEs), Joint Kill Chain Events (JKCEs), and Air Force Weapons School Training Events (WSTEs).<br />2) External Training Events - External training event examples include Northern Edge (NE), Fleet Synthetic Training - Joint (FST-J), and Northern Goshawk (NG) exercises.<br />3) Testing Events -Testing event examples include the Joint Command &amp; Control of Net-Enabled Weapons (JC2NEW) and Joint Fires Coordination Measures (JFCM) joint tests.<br />4) Experimentation Events - Experimentation event examples include Defense of the Homeland Against Asymmetric Missile Attacks (DoHMA) and Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) events.<br />5) Projects - The 705 CTS manages a large number of Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and facility improvement projects aimed at improving M&amp;S capability within the DoD and the international community.<br />6) Distributed Warfighting Center (DWC) - As the integrator of United States Air Force (USAF) and LVC training, the 705 CTS provides the majority of manpower associated with DWC tasks and responsibilities.</p>

A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes disposable patient exam gowns (capes, shorts, gowns) for female and male patients and disposable staff gowns (isolation, lab coats, coveralls).  The entire category of Disposable Protective Apparel (Non-Sterile Patient Exam & Staff Gowns) has an annual demand of over $190,000.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, Cardinal, currently serving the Southwest Region. 

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program and obtaining a DAPA please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is December 2009.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	Evaluation Criteria

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.
Vendors will be required to provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and product literature. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria
1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of Disposable Protective Apparel (Non-Sterile Patient Exam & Staff Gowns) which are latex free; non-toxic and have non-fast dyes; are available in AAMI levels 1-4 and at a minimum barrier protection of AAMI level 2 (When tested for impact penetration and hydrostatic pressure, critical zone components must have a blotter weight gain of no more than 1.0 grams and a hydrostatic resistance of at least 20 cm; have an indication on the gown of the barrier protected regions; made of breathable and lightweight material that maintains the wearers normal body temperature; made of polyethylene-coated polypropylene or other laminate materials which offer better protection than those of non-coated materials; can withstand rubbing and abrasion throughout a procedure decreasing the generation of particulate contaminants and airborne bacterial transmission; must be low lint; have ties behind the neck and at the waist; have ribbed cuffs that are sewn or molded on and do not tear off the sleeve; can accommodate sizes ranging from extra small through XXL.  Disposable Protective Apparel (Non-Sterile Patient Exam & Staff Gowns) that are lightweight, durable, latex free; can withstand rubbing and abrasion throughout a procedure decreasing the generation of particulate contaminants and airborne bacterial transmission and are low lint in styles to accommodate adult male and female patients in a range of sizes from extra small to XXL.

A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes the following products in the following sizes, Cover Isolation Gown Universal size: Extra Small, Small, Medium, Large, and XX Large; Universal Impervious Open Back Knit Cuff size: Extra Small, Small, Medium, Large, and XX Large; Gown Exam Disposable size: Extra Small, Small, Medium, Large, and XX Large; Disposable Patient Short Non-Woven Elastic Waistband size: Extra Small, Small, Medium, Large, and XX Large.

2.	Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ with the initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed above. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).

3.	Vendors must provide supporting documentation that all Disposable Protective Apparel (Non-Sterile Patient Exam & Staff Gowns) that are manufactured and/or distributed are FDA approved, and provide supporting documentation to support this requirement with the initial submittal.  Products will conform to the levels of barrier protection by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) PB70:2003 guidelines for Liquid Barrier Performance and Classification of Protection Apparel and Drapes Intended for use in Health Care Facilities.

4.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Disposable Protective Apparel (Non-Sterile Patient Exam & Staff Gowns) product line.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM PT, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree and 5 = Strongly Agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The evaluations are conducted in a non-clinical setting. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the break, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM PT, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree and 5 = Strongly Agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The evaluations are conducted in a non-clinical setting. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the break, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.


Clinical/Performance Criteria
1.	The specimen can be easily viewed in the container.
a.	The opacity of the container/collector to ensure the container is clear enough for the specimen to be viewed and verified before sending to the lab.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the non-clinical setting by use of the product at least 2 times.
c.	The evaluator will carefully scrutinize the container/collector for opacity visually. The expectation is that container/collector will be satisfactorily clear enough to view and verify the specimen.

2.	There is adequate space on the container to place a label or write on the container and the gradation scale on the container/collector is easy to read.
a.	There must be adequate space on the container to label with the patient information and the gradation scale needs to be clearly and easily read to facilitate loading the specimen into the container/collector.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the non-clinical setting by use of the product at least 2 times.
c.	The evaluator will closely examine the container for adequate space for applying a patient label or writing the patient information and a gradation scale on the container/collector. The expectation is that the patient information will be easily and adequately placed on the container and the gradation scale will clearly and easily be read.

3.	The cap/lid can be easily secured to the container, has an indicator that assures it is secured in place and does not leak.
a.	Securing the cap to the container/collector easily and hearing or seeing an indicator that assures it is secured in place ensures the contents will not leak during transport.  
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the non-clinical setting by use of the product at least 2 times.
c.	The evaluator will place the cap on the container/collector, hear and/or visualize the indicator that is it secured and then shake the container and visualize if the contents leak out. The expectation is that the contents of the container/collector will not leak out or the cap be dislodged.

4.	The packaging of sterile containers is easy to open and allows for aseptic delivery to the sterile field.
a.	The packaging has a feature that makes it easy to open and allow the user to place the sterile container/collector on the sterile field without risk of contamination.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the non-clinical setting by use of the product at least 2 times.
c.	The evaluator will examine the packaging for the place that allows for a secure hold, open the package as if delivering the container/collector to the sterile field and place the container on the field. The expectation is that the package will open easily and the container/collector placed on the sterile field without being contaminated.

5.	The size, type, expiration date if applicable & latex content of the container/collector is easily identified from the packaging.
a.	The container/collector packaging clearly lists the size, type, expiration date if applicable and latex content of the item to enable the user to quickly and easily choose the correct container/collector for use.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the non-clinical setting by use of the product at least 2 times.
c.	The evaluator will carefully scrutinize the entire package for size, type, expiration date if applicable and latex content. The expectation is that size, type, expiration date if applicable and latex content are easily identified.

Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

The scope of renovations is limited to 572SF at basement level, 6,756 SF at first floor, 7,780 SF at second floor and 340 SF at roof level stair/elevator vestibule area).  Total renovated area is therefore approximately 15,448 SF.  In general, the scope of work involves demolition and removal of existing small weapons fire training facilities in four primary training room/spaces and miscellaneous adjacent spaces to conclude stair wells, corridors, and elevator shaft.  The major training rooms/spaces contain flexible simulated residential floor plan settings.  Partitions are movable and consists of ballistic resistant steel panels.  Typically, the walls, flooring, and ceilings of the training spaces are protected with layers of rubber curtains and or plants.  Other systems are also being renovated to include HVAC, electrical, and fire protection.  The existing HVAC system serving the renovated is bade on a supply system through the floor and the return at the ceiling.  This system concept is being reversed with supply from the ceiling and return through the floor.  
This project also removes, replaces and upgrades the movable ballistic wall panel system, and associated lamella rubber system in the training areas. This effort includes the replacement of 250 panels, 3' wide x 8' high in both Areas.  Panels include a ballistic resistant steel frame and ballistic resistant interior steel panel, and are covered with a layer of 1/4: self-healing fire retardant rubber linear material.  Scope also includes a new overhead track system for panels. Replacement of the lamella bullet trap protection is also included in the basic scope of this project.  The project also provides for the complete phased replacement of the fire alarm system and panel. 

The estimated construction cost for this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) Joint Munitions & Lethality (JM&L)Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (PM CAS) and the Product Manager for Demilitarization (PM Demil), is seeking information from Industry on their ability to demilitarize M483 Projectiles, recover the projectile metal parts and then utilize the metal parts to Load, Assemble, and Pack (LAP) the XM1122 Insensitive Munitions (IM) High Explosive (HE) Projectile.     

The Government is considering a contracting approach that would divide the M1122 production into three (3) phases:
1)	Demilitarization of the M483 projectile to include downloading M483s while providing metal parts that will meet necessary Quality Standards and the disposal of grenades. 
2)	Loading of the empty shell body with a high-density concrete inert fill and melt-pour asphalt.
3)	Final LAP of the M1122 projectile IAW the LAP and Quality Specifications.
The Government will allow responders to propose performing all three phases, or any combination of one or more phases.  The Government is interested in the respondents assessment of the above approach.
The contractors response to the Request for Information (RFI) will include recurring Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) prices to download M483 projectiles, dispose of grenades, load the empty shell body with inert fill and asphalt and LAP the XM1122 projectile for the following quantity ranges. The contractor shall show these prices individually and the response shall include top-level business assumptions behind the individual prices, as well as any Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), facilitization or tooling costs.
o	  5,000  10,000 projectileso	10,001  20,000 projectileso	20,001  30,000 projectileso	30,001  40,000 projectiles
Contractors are advised that no funding will be provided for preparation of the ROMs.

<p>Notice Type: Notice of Intent</p>
<p>Synopsis: Creech AFB connection to Clark County Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Governments intends to enter into a utility service contract with the Clark County Water Reclamation District (CCWRD) on or about 15 Dec 2009 to treat all wastewater generated on Creech AFB, NV. CCWRD is a Publically Owned Treatment Works which is a requirement for Creech AFB to retain the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) domestic sewage exclusion set forth in Section 3023(a), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 6939e. The Government will deactivate the base wastewater treatment plant and connect to the new CCWRD Indian Springs Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility located in Indian Springs, NV. Standard wastewater treatment tariff rates are applicable.</p>
<p>Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:</p>
<p>22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested parties may e-mail matthew.leonard@nellis.af.mil or fax 702-652-5405, Attn: Capt Matthew Leonard, not later than 26 October 2009; 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time.</p>
<p>DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>CCWRD is the only POTW in the immediate area that can economically treat sewage with the RCRA domestic sewage exclusion, complying with surface water discharge limits imposed by the NV DEQ. Using the CCWRD to treat Creech's wastewater satisfies the requirements of FAR Part 6.302-1(b)(3) as it is the only option that allows the base to maintain environmental compliance and retain its RCRA domestic sewage exclusion.</p>

<p>This acquisition will be made under a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) as there is only one responsible source. The JOFOC is per FAR part 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The steel in plate making at the BEP must be free of impurities. If impurities are present in the material, the material will fail the inspection process. Crucible steel meets the manufacturer's specifications of heat treating. Prior testing on other sources of steel have proved inadequate quality of steel other then the steel provided by Crucible. In order for the BEP to maintain ISO certification, it is necessary to acquire steel from Crucible Service Center.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Immunization Services Division (ISD) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a contract to the University of Michigan, 2901 Baxter Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2150. By contractual agreement, The University of Michigan shall determine the relative technical and regulatory costs to develop and produce vaccines by utilizing economic analysis and data mining methods. The University of Michigan will submit a study design and a plan for completion of this project. Throughout the study, University of Michigan researchers will submit reports describing the data collected, interview progress, and preliminary analytic results. At the completion of data collection, the contractor will conduct a final economic analysis and submit a report detailing the analysis, and prepare a manuscript suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. For further details, see the attached statement of work. The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR Subpart 6.302-1. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the continued need to match existing services of on-going studies being conducted by the CDC. Regents of the University of Michigan, is believed to be the only source available that possesses the intellectual property rights to proprietary information of the vaccine pricing model developed for the CDC through a cooperative agreement, reference: FOA #IP06_010, Industrial Costs of Commercializing and Vaccines, and CFR 45 74.36. Further, University of Michigan researchers have made unique use of the Pharmaprojects database to develop a vaccine production pricing model that is both unique and rare to the vaccine manufacturing industry. Failure to acquire services from the University of Michigan, will preclude the use of such proprietary information, thus will result in significant project delays, skewed results from the pricing model, and ultimately create a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Firms that believe they can provide the services, as listed in the attached Statement of Work, are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of the publication date of this synopsis. Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses. Inquires may be sent to Russell T. Oxford by e-mail at roxford@CDC.gov or by fax to 770-488-2044

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)<br />National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)<br />Immunization Services Division (ISD)</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: 2009-N-11508</p>
<p><br />Project Title: Economics of Vaccines - Tracking Vaccines under Development to Determine Cost Drivers of the Vaccine Development and Approval Process</p>
<p>C.1 Background</p>
<p>This special studies requirement will address several objectives of the U.S. National Vaccine Plan: 1) encourage the development of new and improved vaccines; 2) ensure the stable supply of vaccines; and 3) conduct research into the economics of vaccines [http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/vacc_plan/vacc_planp25.pdf ].</p>
<p>Several times between 2000 and 2004, there were shortages of vaccines medically recommended for both children and adults in the US [Coleman, NVAC]. One of the concerns that arose out of the various stakeholder discussions regarding the reasons for the shortages was the increasing business-related costs of complying with FDA regulations in the development and production of vaccines [Coleman, IOM]. While it is true that regulatory costs of doing business have increased, there is also a potential argument to be made that the technical costs of developing and producing vaccines have also increased. Many of the vaccines that have been developed in recent years use expensive new technologies and adjuvant (to improve immune response). There is no research that separates development and production costs into regulatory and technical components. This research proposal will identify what portion of costs may be attributable to regulatory requirements, and what are attributable to technical requirements.</p>
<p><br />Since 2006, the University of Michigan has been funded by the CDC Immunization Services Division to develop a proprietary pricing model for new vaccines that is now the intellectual property of the University of Michigan, with rights of use granted to the CDC. With appropriated grants funding, the University of Michigan purchased the use of a proprietary database called Pharmaprojects. This database tracks the movement of vaccine products from their inception through licensure, through all clinical trial phases. University researchers have gained a significant amount of expertise at data mining in Pharmaprojects, a skill which took quite a bit of time as the data collection systems of Pharmaprojects are idiosyncratic The uniqueness of the University of Michigan use of the Pharmacoprojects database was to mine data for microeconomic analysis of specific vaccine and biologics products that have not been previously analyzed either in business or university research. In addition, researchers at the University of Michigan have developed other project-specific skills: extracting clinical trials data from FDA websites; interpreting FDA vaccine-specific data available from the agency; and building relationships with business and technical personnel working in vaccine-originating businesses or vaccine policy arenas (e.g., pharmaceutical consultants, biotechnology firms, pharmaceutical firms, and policy makers). In addition to becoming expert at extracting original data for microeconomic analysis of vaccines and biologics, the University of Michigan researchers have developed intellectual property in the form of a unique pricing model that incorporates: the time it takes vaccine products to work through all phases of development and post-licensure production; risk of vaccine product failures; and pricing options. This model provides a clear picture of the overall net return to businesses that invest in vaccine development and sales.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this CDC project will take advantage of the intellectual property and project-specific data collection and analytic skills and professional contacts of researchers at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p><br />C.2. Purpose<br /><br />1) Understand how the regulatory process affects the decision to engage in the development of new vaccines; and</p>
<p>2) Understand which costs are necessitated by the technical process of vaccine development and which costs are necessitated by the government regulatory process.<br /><br />The CDC requires this information because :<br />1. Understanding the interaction of regulation and the decision to produce vaccines will allow the government to create policies that retain current vaccine manufacturers in the business and attract potential new entrants to the market<br />2. Understanding the division of costs between regulation and technical processes will allow government to:<br />a. Streamline regulatory processes if they are found to be unnecessarily burdensome<br />b. Determine potential financial incentives to vaccine developers that might reduce prices of new vaccines which, in turn, would decrease vaccine program purchase costs<br />c. Hold data-informed discussions in venues where the U.S. Government is chastised for driving up research, development and manufacturing costs through unnecessary regulations.</p>
<p>C.3 Objectives</p>
<p>Specific objectives are to:<br />1. Update existing, proprietary pricing model that is the intellectual property of the Regents of the University of Michigan developed at the behest of CDC through a cooperative agreement with the Regents of the University of Michigan.<br />2. Follow a cohort of ~150 to 200 new vaccine products in Pharmaprojects, a proprietary database that tracks the time needed for new vaccine products to progress from inception to licensure,<br />3. Interview the vaccine originators of each product, using the contacts developed by Dr. Davis and his group at the University of Michigan, and, where there is more than one originator (e.g., where a manufacturer buys the rights to a product developed by a biotechnology firm), then interview all involved,<br />4. Track time and regulatory activity through requests to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and through web sites run by the FDA, and<br />5. Model and analyze the data to apportion costs between regulatory and technical requirements.</p>
<p>Through the use of quality health economic analysis and prevention effectiveness research, these data will be used to support the implementation of effective and sustainable immunization policies that ensure the supply of current and potential future vaccines.</p>
<p><br />C.4 Requesting Agency</p>
<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)<br />National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)<br />1600 Clifton Road, Mailstop E-52<br />Atlanta, GA 30333</p>
<p>C.5 Scope</p>
<p>The contractor will submit a study design and a plan for completion of the work. Throughout the study, the contractor will submit reports describing the data collected, interviews progress, and preliminary analytic results. At the completion of data collection, the contractor will conduct a final economic analysis and submit a report detailing the analysis, and prepare a manuscript suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>
<p>C.6 Place of Performance</p>
<p>All work, to exclude breifings or presentation of findings, will take place at the Contractors place of business. Briefings will take place at the Requesting Agency (See C.4)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C.7 Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance is 24 months from the date of award. The project will be funded in two (2) 12 month increments, to include one base year and one option year. Determination to continue the second 12 month increment (exercise the option year) will be made prior to the end of the intial 12-month period, and is dependent on contractor performance within the base period.</p>
<p><br />C.8 Continuity of Services.</p>
<p>The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are considered vital to the U.S. Government and must be continued without interruption and that, upon contract expiration, a successor, either the U.S. Government or another contractor, may continue these services. The contractor agrees to (1) furnish phase-in knowledge transfer and (2) exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor.</p>
<p>C.9 Technical Services Required:</p>
<p>Use economic analysis and data mining methods to estimate the relative technical and regulatory costs to develop and produce vaccines, and report results of findings.</p>
<p>C.10 Tasks:</p>
<p>The contractor shall:</p>
<p>Task 1 Study design development</p>
<p>Within two weeks of award, the Contractor's Principal Investigator and Project Manager will, in person or by teleconference, confer with and receive advice from CDC Project Staff. Items to be discussed will include, but not be limited to, numbers of products to be followed in the cohort of vaccines, data mining methods, time table for key informant interviews, collection of secondary data from FDA and FDA websites, refinement of pricing model, and potential estimation techniques. After this meeting the contractor will incorporate the advice of the CDC Project Staff into a study work plan. This task is to receive 5% of total project effort.</p>
<p>Task 2 Submission of work plan</p>
<p>Within three weeks of receipt of the statement of work, the Contractor shall forward to the Project Officer the project work plan. The work plan shall include the Contractor's proposed methods to perform task order requirements within the stated time frames, management and staffing plan, and a budget reflecting estimated costs to accomplish the requirements. This task is to receive 5% of total project effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task 3 Develop vaccine cohort and report initial results</p>
<p>Within three months of award of the task order, the Contractor will identify and collect information on ~150-200 unique vaccine products (actual number to be determined in discussion). The data mining results will be compiled, including identification of all of the vaccine originators, and a report submitted. This report will be distributed to CDC Project Staff for review at a meeting convened by the Contractor either in Atlanta or by teleconference. At this meeting the views of the CDC Project Staff will be obtained on how to proceed with interviewing key personnel at each vaccine originator and identifying all of the costs, regulatory and technical, associated with each product. It is anticipated that there will be fewer vaccine originators than unique products on the assumption that the same originators will have multiple products in development. At this time, the number of originators to be interviewed will be decided in discussion between CDC Project Staff and the Contractor Research Staff. This task is to receive 15% of total project effort.</p>
<p><br />Task 4 Interview of vaccine originators and collection of secondary data</p>
<p>During the following 12 months, the Contractor shall interview the vaccine originators agreed upon to collect cost information. In addition, secondary data collection shall proceed for the vaccine product cohort. Secondary data collection shall include, but not be limited to, FOIA requests to the FDA and use of FDA-sponsored web sites. It is understood that some of the collection of secondary data may take longer than 12 months because much of this data collection is subject to the response times of the FDA, which are out of the Contractor's control. At the end of the 12 month period, the Contractor shall host a second meeting (by teleconference, in Atlanta, or at the University of Michigan) and distribute a report of the initial findings synthesizing original Pharmaprojects data, secondary data, and key informant interviews. Discussion between the Contractor and CDC Project Staff will occur regarding the final task of the project. This task is to receive 55% of the total project effort.</p>
<p><br />Task 5 Final economic analysis report submission</p>
<p>Within 18 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will conduct economic analyses using the final data set and submit a report outlining the methods, assumptions, and final results. The economic analysis will include an update of the original pricing model, and specific analysis of 3 to 5 unique products. This report will be distributed to CDC Project Staff for review at a meeting convened by the Contractor in Atlanta or by teleconference. At this meeting the views of the CDC Project Staff will be obtained on the report regarding methods, assumptions, final results and suggestions for publication venue. This task is to receive 15% of total project effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task 6 Manuscript for publication</p>
<p>Within 18 months of award of the task order the Contractor will deliver a manuscript suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The final version will be sent by the Contractor to the CDC Project Officer for CDC clearance and submission to a peer-reviewed journal for publication pending CDC clearance. This task is to receive 10% total effort.</p>

This notice supports a determination that a sole source award to Deloitte Consulting, LLP, under the existing Contract # DTFR53-09-F-00069, is appropriate under FAR 6.302-1.  The increase in the scope of work will result in an increased cost of 61.66%.

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS FOR PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR UNDER W91278-06-C-0003.<BR><BR>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification using Recovery Act funding to contract number W91278-06-C-0003, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, West Point Project, West Point Georgia, awarded to Anderson Construction Company, 58 Crozier Lane, Fort Gaines, Georgia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the following work (inside the powerhouse):  1) install new security monitor and controls; 2) install new lobby door strike plate and camera: 3) install new DVR. (Outside the powerhouse): 4) install and program fence sensor wire on security fence.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor is responsible for the power plant security system maintenance; 2) The contractor has experience in working around high voltage equipment. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen circumstance encountered during the job.<BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<a href="mailto:steve.sheridan@amedd.army.mil">Center for Health Care Contracting</a>
<DESC>Center for Health Care Contracting, 2107 17th Street, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, 78234, intends to award a sole source contract to Applied Biosystems (AB) for 21 various AB reagents and supplies in support of 65 AB analyzers.  The reagents and supplies must be equipment-specific for the various procedures for DNA identification.  These include the following 3 reasons&<BR> 	1. Needs to comply with other agencies.  AFDIL is an American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) accredited forensic lab, which means the FBIs Quality Assurance Document is followed.  Based on accreditation adherence (section IV of the Master Operating Plan and the FBIs QAS document), all reagents and equipment must be developmentally validated by the company and internally validated by the laboratory as well as pass a stringent quality control before being released for casework <BR>2. Not cost effective to switch.  A cost analysis was conducted to determine the cost of testing and validating new reagents for AFDIL.  Because continuity of service is paramount, validation of New Dye Terminator Chemistry System would require dual operations for 6-9 months (w/ additional staffing & equipment costing approximately $1.7M).  The dual operations would include product testing, data analysis, trouble shooting, summary write-up, review, and SOP generation.  An additional 3-6 month phased-in training of 47 staff members on new products after validation would also be required.<BR>3. Warranty Requirements.  IAW service manuals, the use of non AB reagents that deposit or cause to deposit residual matter in any AB instrument flow path may lead to instrument failure.  This may require remedial repairs outside the maintenance agreement that may double or triplicate the price, and suspend DNA processing.  Four current maintenance service contracts for these AB instruments are being administered in house: W81XWH07P0381, W81XWH06P0632, W81XWH07P0496 and W81K0409P0026.<BR>Period of Performance is 1 Nov 2009  30 September 2010 with one 12 month Option period through 30 Sep 2011.  Task orders will be issued on an as needed basis.  This requirement is for the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington D.C, 20306.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, FAR 13.501(a) (41 UU.S.C. 428a) Sole source justification (SAP greater than $100K), only one source reasonably available.  A Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition Justification was approved on 24 September 2009.  Center for Health Care Contracting intends to award a sole source contract to Applied Biosystems for AB specific reagents and supplies under NAICS code 325413. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations. No solicitation will be made available.  steve.sheridan@amedd.army.mil

DFAS 52.223-9000, ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PRODUCTS (OCT 2007)

The Environmentally Preferable Products clause is included in this contract to articulate the Governments polices on Green Contracting.  FAR 23.403 sets forth the Federal Governments policy to acquire items composed of the highest percentage of recycled-content practical, in a cost effective manner while still obtaining other contracting goals.  Recycled-content products are identified in the Environmental Protection Agencys Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs).  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be producing a similar list which designates Bio-based products.  EPA guideline items (and USDA designated bio-based products, when designated) are seen as the minimum that should be considered when evaluating environmentally preferable materials.  Other environmentally preferable materials and products not listed, but commonly used in industry outside of the Government, should also be considered.  

The recently issued Executive Order 13423 (January 24, 2007) requires federal agencies to use sustainable environmental practices, including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products.  Moreover, it now requires that paper of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content must be acquired or used in Agency acquisitions of goods and services.  

1.  	Mandatory use of Paper and other products with recycled content.
(a)	All paper utilized in the performance of this contract must be of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content.
(b)	The contractor, by responding to this RFP/RFQ, affirmatively acknowledges that they will, to the maximum extent practicable, use sustainable environmental practices including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products in the performance of this contract that meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items, which are found at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm.   In addition, by responding to this RFQ/RFP the contractor is certifying the deliverables required under this contract shall meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items.   

2.  	Notice of Green alternatives in Offerors product/service.
(a)	When offering a product or service that contains Green components as that term is defined at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm, the contractor shall make the Contracting Officer aware of such facts in the submission of their quote or proposal.  
(b) 	The contractor, when appropriate, shall comply with FAR Clause 52.223-9 Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA Designated Products.

3.  	Affirmative Duty of Contractors to adhere to Green Contracting Policy.  
(a)	Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to examine its packaging to eliminate or reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable material for non-recyclable material in packaging.
(b)  	Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to find other materials utilized in the delivery of services under this contract and examine whether it can reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable materials for non-recyclable materials of items consumed in the furnishing of their services.

<DESC>RECOVERY: Combined Synopsis/solicitation for Dell Laptop Personal Computers
<p>RECOVERY: THIS ACQUISITION IS BEING FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. FAR Subpart 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-36 are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-36.</p>
<p>Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov.

Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430 with a size standard of 100 employees. This acquisition cannot be conducted as a total small business set aside because there is no U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) waiver to the non-manufacturer rule for NAICS code 423430. This requirement is being competed as an unrestricted full and open competition among any Dell-authorized resellers/business partners.</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 applies to this Solicitation. Documentation has already been obtained by the Contract Specialist.</p>
<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>The Economic Development Administration has standardized its laptop usage using Dell laptop PC's, which enables the agency to manage and maintain a limited number of software images that conform to the Federal desktop Core configuration (FDCC) requirements. The Dell E4300 and E6400 models are two of a small number of models for which the EDA has an image in place. Due to the EDA's small size, limited resources, and geographical distribution, it is imperative that these standards are enforced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:</p>
<p>The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:</p>
<p>52.212-1, <br />52.212-3, <br />52.212-4, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3 and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a) (1) and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.203-15 (see full text below), <br />52.204-11 (see full text below), <br />52.212-5 Alternate II,<br />52.222-3, <br />52.222-19, <br />52.222-21, <br />52.222-26, <br />52.222-36, <br />52.222-50,<br />52.225-13,<br />52.232-33,<br />52.233-3 and<br />52.233-4.</p>

<p>52.204-11 AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT-REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (MAR 2009)<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause- <br />"Contract", as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16. <br />"First-tier subcontract" means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act. <br />"Jobs created" means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. <br />"Jobs retained" means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. <br />"Total compensation" means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractor's past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)): <br />(1) Salary and bonus. <br />(2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments. <br />(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees. <br />(4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. <br />(5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified. <br />(6) Other compensation. For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000. <br />(b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public. <br />(c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter. <br />(d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at www.FederalReporting.gov. <br />(1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable. <br />(2) The amount of Recovery Act funds invoiced by the contractor for the reporting period. A cumulative amount from all the reports submitted for this action will be maintained by the government's on-line reporting tool. <br />(3) A list of all significant services performed or supplies delivered, including construction, for which the contractor invoiced in this calendar quarter. <br />(4) Program or project title, if any. <br />(5) A description of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract, including significant deliverables and, if appropriate, associated units of measure. <br />(6) An assessment of the contractor's progress towards the completion of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract (i.e., not started, less than 50 percent completed, completed 50 percent or more, or fully completed). This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act. <br />(7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractor's workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide- <br />(i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). This description may rely on job titles, broader labor categories, or the contractor's existing practice for describing jobs as long as the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and <br />(ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas. A job cannot be reported as both created and retained. <br />(8) Names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated officers of the Contractor for the calendar year in which the contract is awarded if- <br />(i) In the Contractor's preceding fiscal year, the Contractor received- <br />(A) 80 percent or more of its annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and <br />(B) $25,000,000 or more in annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and <br />(ii) The public does not have access to information about the compensation of the senior executives through periodic reports filed under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)) or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. <br />(9) For subcontracts valued at less than $25,000 or any subcontracts awarded to an individual, or subcontracts awarded to a subcontractor that in the previous tax year had gross income under $300,000, the Contractor shall only report the aggregate number of such first tier subcontracts awarded in the quarter and their aggregate total dollar amount. <br />(10) For any first-tier subcontract funded in whole or in part under the Recovery Act, that is over $25,000 and not subject to reporting under paragraph 9, the contractor shall require the subcontractor to provide the information described in (i), (ix), (x), and (xi) below to the contractor for the purposes of the quarterly report.

ATTACHMENT 1 ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10 PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY (OCTOBER 2006) (a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&amp;id=59&amp;fam=0 . Note: Personal Services Contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs. (b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. &ldquo;MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.&rdquo; (c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer&rsquo;s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision). (d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met: (1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad; (2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and (3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition. (e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled &ldquo;Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.&rdquo; In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs. (f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor&rsquo;s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism. (g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual&rsquo;s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider. (h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent. (i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>Solicitation W911QY-10-T-0001:  More Questions and Answers<BR><BR>Q)  Does the existing refrigeration system include a back-up diesel generator?<BR><BR>A)  Yes.  But not all refrigeration systems we might use this array with will include backup power.  Think of the array as a general purpose tool for us to use to test known and unknown equipment.<BR><BR>Q)  If so, is it desired that our solar power system be capable of interfacing with that system (e.g., use that generator as an automatic  back-up to our system, etc.)?<BR><BR>A)  Yes, to an extent; your balance of system might need equipment to protect itself from surges, but the system being solicited is not responsible for switching between power supplies, or automatically controlling other power supplies.  It need only output.  We are assuming that electronics necessary to adapt to power sources will be aboard the system, but at the same time expecting that the BOS will offer a variety of common AC and DC outputs at common voltages.<BR><BR>Q)  If so, what is the size, manufacturer and model number of the existing generator?<BR><BR>A)  Because this system will be used on multiple projects, specifics on any backup generator cannot be supplied.<BR><BR>Q)  If not, is it desired that our solar power system include a back-up diesel generator (e.g., to protect against prolonged periods of poor weather, etc.)?<BR><BR>A)  No, that would make it too expensive, and it is impossible to anticipate the needs of future applications.<BR><BR>Q)  What system installation/testing location should we assume for system design purposes (e.g., to determine available sun hours per day to size the array, etc.)?<BR><BR>A)  The power output of the SPPS shall be no less than 2.75 kW at 1000 W/m2 in a 25C environment.  If you design for this, the location is irrelevant.<BR><BR>Q)  What are the technical specifications (manufacturer, model number, spec sheet, drawing and website for further information) for the output plug of the refrigeration unit?<BR><BR>A)  The system solicited should include an electrical enclosure providing power conversion and conditioning equipment -- i.e., the balance of system -- that renders the DC output of the array useable to typical military and civilian electrically-powered equipment.  It would be best if the BOS electrical enclosure include multiple outlets and key in on what is typical to the civilian world.  It can be said that the first application has as its input connector a PowerModHP Dual Pole male - Series A.  <BR><BR>Q)  What are the technical specifications (manufacturer, model number, spec sheet, drawing and website for further information) for the refrigeration system?<BR><BR>A)  Because this system will be used on multiple projects, specifics to the first application are expected to be irrelevant.<BR><BR>Q)  Specifically, what is the power requirement for the refrigeration unit? Voltage? Amperage draw? Frequency? Phase (split of three-phase)?<BR><BR>A)  The nominal and maximum open circuit voltage of the SPPS shall be in the range 48-72 volts DC output to the balance of system.  This voltage shall not fall below 29 volts while the array experiences at least 100 W/m2 of incident sunlight.  These specifications will dictate was must and can be provided out of the electrical enclosure with common civilian outputs.<BR><BR>Q)  Please confirm that we should assume a system configuration similar to our SkyStation (ISO container -based power system)?<BR><BR>A)  The storage/shipping container is not the responsibility of the offeror.<BR><BR>Q)  If an ISO container is not desired, there are other shelter construction options available, such as lightweight metal, concrete and panelized. If one of these alternatives is desired, please let us know.<BR><BR>A)  The expectation is that this system is mobile, traveling with the movements of, for example, a Forward Operating Base, and suffering the harsh conditions of military life.  Also note that certain content of the proposal seems to imply we expect something that when transported is relatively compact and lightweight.  You may propose anything you wish, but keep in mind that you are competing with what other offerors may propose as they make their own interpretations.<BR><BR>Q)  Is there a preference for how the structure rests on the ground? How much prior sitework (clearing/ leveling) would we be able to rely on prior to placement of the system? Would a system that did not penetrate the ground be preferred?<BR><BR>A)  Assume that the roughest ground the system will be set up on will be an open field.  It does not matter if the system structure penetrates the ground, for instance requiring stakes.<BR><BR>Q)  Is there any minimum/maximum range of height /clearance for the system to meet? To what potential purpose would the space under the system be used?<BR><BR>A)  It is likely the refrigerated container the system powers will be placed under and shaded by the shelter.  Refrigerated ISO containers used by the U.S. military are typically 8 feet tall.  It is expected the shelter cannot be too high if it is capable of easy set up by soldiers and is sturdy enough to survive high winds.  <BR><BR>Note the solicitation states that lower weight is of high value and lower transport cube is of high value.  This may effect deployed size.  <BR><BR>Q)  What is the delivery date and location required for this solicitation?<BR><BR>A)  The delivery location will either be Natick, MA, or a Florida location, depending on how long this solicitation takes and how long construction takes.<BR><BR>Q)  Is there a DD 1423 or other CDRL information available that I have not located on the FBO.GOV site for this solicitation?<BR><BR>A)  No, there is not a DD1423 or other CDRL information available.<BR><BR>Q)  Can or should this system be designed to mount to an existing container/trailer system?<BR><BR>A)  No<BR><BR>Because the military's methods for shipping materiel into theatres involves ISO containers, and there are requirements that the ISO containers must retain their ISO rating in both structure and method, we have shied away from mounting vulnerable equipment to exterior surfaces.<BR><BR>Furthermore, because even 3 kW is insufficient to power most (but not all) systems, serving only to offset and not completely eliminate fuel use and generator hours (still a worthwhile goal) we don't feel a pressing need to integrate solar arrays with specific assets, anticipating instead that they are more functional/usable if they remain independent and therefore fungible.<BR><BR>Lastly, because we are anticipating testing with future refrigeration systems that have unknown specific characteristics, and we wish the cost of the system to go toward meeting the requirements described in the solicitation, there is no need to design for mounting to an existing asset.

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Intermittent, Washington, DC - based</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Program Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Program Advisor position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups, and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned. The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD), the Senior Transition Advisor will:</p>
<p>&bull; Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in the field and in Washington, DC including the provision of ad hoc support to new OTI country program start-ups and on-call technical assistance;</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct, in collaboration with the relevant OTI regional team, assessments for possible new country programs, and visits to field sites in areas where OTI has projects;</p>
<p>&bull; Act as OTI's in-country Start-Up Manager for limited periods of time for new country start-ups, or provide support while an OTI Country Representative is on leave, or when OTI has not determined the length of a new country program, but is required to have a presence on the ground;</p>
<p>&bull; Execute, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Negotiate, within the guidelines provided by the OTI Chief, FPD, or his/her designee, program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Conceptualize and design country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, assist in refining strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in-country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull; Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials.</p>
<p>&bull; Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull; Advise and/or assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs, and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems, providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>
<p>&bull; Advise Senior Management and Team Leaders on budget processes and reviews, preparing justification documentation when necessary;</p>
<p>&bull; Update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull; Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners.</p>
<p><br />SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Advisor will be supervised by the OTI Chief, Field Programs Division, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the OTI Country Representative when in the field.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:</p>
<p>The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>

<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Intermittent, Washington, DC - based</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Transition Program Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>The OTI Transition Program Advisor position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups, and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned. The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD) or his/her designee, the Transition Program Advisor will:</p>
<p>&bull; Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in the field and in Washington, DC, including the provision of ad hoc support to new OTI country program start-ups, ongoing OTI country programs and on-call technical assistance;</p>
<p>&bull; In collaboration with the relevant OTI regional team, participate in assessments for possible new country programs and visits to field sites in areas where OTI has projects;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the OTI Country team with new country start-ups, or provide support while the OTI Country Representative or Deputy Country Representative is on leave or when OTI has not determined the length of a new country program, but is required to have a presence on the ground;</p>
<p>&bull; Support, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the OTI Country Team in determining program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts, within the guidelines provided by the OTI Chief, FPD, or his/her designee;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in conceptualizing and designing country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull; When required by the OTI Country team, represent OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the OTI team in identifying or seeking out NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems and in providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>
<p>&bull; Review program budgets and propose changes and adjustments and draft any written justifications that will assist in securing quick approvals;</p>
<p>&bull; In collaboration with the OTI Country team, update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the U.S. Department of State on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull; Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners; and,</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to help ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p><br />SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:</p>
<p>The OTI Transition Program Advisor will be supervised by the OTI Chief, Field Programs Division, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the OTI Country Representative when in the field.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:</p>
<p>The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI is contributing to the integrated USAID development strategy in Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), and other areas of Pakistan as necessary and appropriate, through a three-year program designed to engage local communities and GOP representatives in participatory appraisal processes to identify community priority needs, and to quickly address some of the most immediate of these needs.</p>
<p>This initiative broadens USAID/OTI programming in NWFP and builds off of lessons learned and best practices from the ongoing USAID/OTI FATA Transition Initiative. In addition, the Pakistan Transition Initiative (PTI) program actively seeks ways to coordinate with other actors, particularly during post-military operation interventions. Although program operations are primarily centered in NWFP, the PTI program is conducting operations throughout Pakistan as necessary and appropriate.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>In November 2007, USAID/OTI launched a new program in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Since that time, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) has focused its efforts on bringing security and development to FATA, demonstrating a new commitment to the FATA through the creation of the FATA Secretariat (FS), and more recently the FATA Development Authority (FDA), to attract investment to the region. In 2007, the FS produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) through which the GOP intends to bring sustained development to the region. The GOP has pledged a billion dollars to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States.</p>
<p>In 2009 the program has expanded outside of FATA and is now known as the Pakistan Transition Initiative (PTI). The program supports the Government of Pakistan's development efforts to better integrate marginalized communities into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan. PTI supports the Government of Pakistan in identifying community priorities and addressing some of the region's most immediate needs. PTI requires close coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department and Department of Defense activities in the region.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), manages a program aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc. In addition, the program conducts media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective for hiring for this position is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight, and management of the OTI country program.</p>

<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

This is not a Request for Proposal. Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment to develop by the government. All inquiries must be sent to: <a href="mailto:AFNIC.ENSE@us.af.mil">AFNIC.ENSE@us.af.mil</a>.&nbsp; or <a href="mailto:michael.mcmiller@us.af.mil">michael.mcmiller@us.af.mil</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(618) 229 5589, (FAX<br />&nbsp;(618)&nbsp; 229-6839 or&nbsp;tracy.<a href="mailto:tracybraadshaw@scott.af.mil">bradshaw@scott.af.mil</a> &nbsp;229-6328&nbsp;.&nbsp; Please include "EVSC1000" in e-mail response subject line to avoid e-mail spam filter. The government is currently conducting a market survey and analysis of government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products that can meet the requirements to support automation of the certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) process based on the Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) for the Department of the Air Force (AF).
<p>The C&amp;A process is designed to ensure that IT systems operate at an acceptable risk level, with reduced exposure to threats, and identified vulnerabilities are sufficiently mitigated. C&amp;A provides standardization, increased confidence, lower level of risk, and reduced cost. DoD policy states that all DoD IT systems maintain an appropriate level of confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, and availability that reflects a balance among the importance and sensitivity of the information and information assets. It includes documented threats and vulnerabilities; the trustworthiness of users and interconnecting systems; the impact of impairment or destruction to the DoD IT system; and cost effectiveness.</p>
<p>The evolution of C&amp;A and the advent of enterprise-level drivers resulted in the creation of the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP). The goals of net-centricity across the DoD have transformed the way Information Assurance (IA) is achieved to facilitate assured information sharing, accelerated decision making, improved Joint warfighting, and the ability to dynamically exchange system-security credentials.</p>
<p>The DIACAP is a dynamic, IA C&amp;A process that supports and complements the net-centric, Global Information Grid (GIG)-based environment. The DIACAP establishes a standard process for:</p>
<p>&bull; Identifying, implementing, and validating standardized IA Controls<br />&bull; Authorizing the operation of DoD information systems<br />&bull; Managing an IA posture across the DoD information system life cycle</p>
<p>The Air Force Network Integration Center (AFNIC) is seeking information regarding a GOTS or COTS solution to automate the AF C&amp;A process based on DIACAP based on policy guidance in, AF Instruction (AFI) 33-210, Air Force Certification and Accreditation Program (AFCAP).</p>
<p>The objective of this RFI is to solicit information regarding a GOTS or COTS product that will be able to perform the total DIACAP integration service, i.e. the design, development, deployment, and support of DIACAP.</p>
<p>RFI responses should attempt to address the capabilities described above. The desired set of requirements is listed in Appendix A. The requirements listed could be modified at any time after the RFI to reflect overall changes due to the current needs of the DoD and USAF, regulatory changes, and/or discoveries made during the RFI process, to enhance the requirements prior to any procurement effort. Appendix B contains a list of guiding authorities which shall be adhered to by any solution. Appendix C includes the definitions of key terms as used in this RFI. Once again, due to new regulations being published, current regulations being updated and/or refined, and the changing needs of the USAF, all requirements are subject to change prior to initiating any procurement process.</p>

(Similar to MS Outlook schedules) The system shall provide an audit trail that captures: path an information object has traveled; tasks performed against the information object; person who performed each task; list of edits and annotations created for the information object; date and time each action was completed. The system shall record/store workflow routing actions, delegation, and/or sub assigning activity (what), date/time stamp information (when), and activity performer information (who).</p>
<p>76. The C&amp;A Tool shall enforce referential integrity of the data repository. The C&amp;A Tool shall not limit the size of the data repository. The C&amp;A Tool shall provide the capability to enter and maintain data for completing all C&amp;A documentation and appendices. The data repository shall be ODBC or JDBC compliant.</p>
<p>77. The C&amp;A Tool shall maintain data for login/authentication. No data shall be accessible to end users from the data repository except via the C&amp;A tool. The C&amp;A Tool shall allow the user to login to the C&amp;A Tool and authenticate once and then grant access to the functionality based on the roles assigned to the user. Once the user logs into the C&amp;A Tool, the C&amp;A Tool shall set his/her roles which shall remain for that logon session. Users shall be automatically locked out of the C&amp;A Tool and have to re-authenticate after no more than 20 minutes of inactivity. The C&amp;A Tool shall use HTTPS for transmission of sensitive data between clients and servers. The C&amp;A Tool shall not require the use of mobile code. The C&amp;A Tool shall have the capability to control access to documentation and appendices at the section level. The C&amp;A Tool shall provide the capability to assign access rights for sections of the project at the activity and document section level.</p>
<p>78. The system shall allow users to print copies of all information objects to include tasks, staff actions, search results, templates, reports, and related metadata on network and local printers.</p>
<p>79. The C&amp;A Tool shall not be constrained from being available on a 24/7 basis. The C&amp;A Tool shall provide for the inherent ability for fault tolerant server processing.</p>
<p>80. The system shall comply with the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, Section 508, Electronic and Information Technology by following the relevant guidance established in section 1194.22 of the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards Document.</p>
<p>81. As discussed earlier, the preferred login in method is integration with the Air Force portal where credentials can be passed to the application. CAC assess is also required for those people who cannot interface through the portal. If neither of these capabilities is not provided then discuss how passwords are implemented and compare to the password requirements in the AFSSI 8520.<br />If this is not available, then password protection should be provided. This protection should meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>82. What mechanisms does the proposed solution provide to simplify the process of completing complex forms? Are users able to save a copy of a filled-in form to their local file system? Can data entered into forms be automatically extracted without requiring manual processing? Can end users easily attach supporting documents to forms so that all relevant information may be submitted as a single package? Does a mechanism exist to force the user to use the current version of the form even if a user has an older version of a form stored on their hard drive? Can watermarks be auto-generated on each page of the document; "Classified / Non-Classified" for example?</p>
<p>83. The application should be XML compatible, capable of importing and exporting data in XML format. Describe what protocols are support for submitting form data (HTTP, HTTPS, SOAP, email).</p>
<p>84. Content should be rendered to a variety of optional formats, such as PDF, PCL, and PostScript in addition to the XML mentioned previously.</p>
<p>85. The system shall have the ability to interface with MS Exchange/Outlook when alerts are sent out. The system shall use the existing Air Force Directory Services (e.g., Microsoft Exchange, Active Directory, Global Address List (GAL)) to obtain address information.</p>
<p>86. With regard to information objects stored in their native format, the "native" application associated with an information object shall be automatically launched from within the system when the user opens the object for viewing or editing. The system should permit users to view a representation of a document for which the user does not have the native application.</p>

<p><br />Definitions</p>
<p>Accreditation Decision. A formal statement by a designated accrediting authority (DAA) regarding acceptance of the risk associated with operating a DoD Information System (IS) and expressed as an authorization to operate (ATO), interim ATO (IATO), interim authorization to test (IATT), or denial of ATO (DATO). The accreditation decision may be issued in hard copy with a traditional signature or issued electronically signed with a DoD public key infrastructure (PKI)-certified digital signature.</p>
<p>Artifacts. System policies, documentation, plans, test procedures, test results, and other evidence that express or enforce the information assurance (IA) posture of the DoD IS, make up the certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) information, and provide evidence of compliance with the assigned IA controls.</p>
<p>Assigned IA Controls. The set of IA controls that a given DoD IS must address to achieve an adequate IA posture. Consist of baseline IA controls plus any augmenting IA controls.</p>
<p>Denial of Authorization to Connect-AF-GIG DAA determination that an IS cannot connect to the AF-GIG because of an inadequate IA design, failure to adequately implement assigned IA Controls, or other lack of adequate security If the IS is already connected, the connection of the IS is terminated.</p>
<p>DIACAP Implementation Plan (DIP). Contains the IS's assigned IA controls. The plan also includes the implementation status, responsible entities, resources, and the estimated completion date for each assigned IA control. The plan may reference applicable supporting implementation material and artifacts.</p>
<p>DIACAP Knowledge Service (KS). A Web-based repository of information and tools for implementing the DIACAP that is maintained through the DIACAP Technical Advisory Group (TAG).</p>
<p>DIACAP Package. The collection of documents or collection of data objects generated through DIACAP implementation for an IS. A DIACAP package is developed through implementing the activities of the DIACAP and maintained throughout a system's life cycle. Information from the package is made available as needed to support an accreditation or other decision such as a connection approval. There are two types of DIACAP packages:</p>
<p>The Comprehensive Package contains all of the information connected with the certification of the IS. It includes the System Identification Profile (SIP), the DIACAP Implementation Plan (DIP), the Supporting Certification Documentation, the DIACAP Scorecard, and the IT Security POA&amp;M, if required.</p>
<p>The Executive Package contains the minimum information for an accreditation decision. It contains the SIP, the DIACAP Scorecard, and the IT Security POA&amp;M, if required.</p>
<p>DIACAP Scorecard. A summary report that succinctly conveys information on the IA posture of a DoD IS in a format that can be exchanged electronically. It shows the implementation status of a DoD IS's assigned IA controls (i.e., compliant (C), non compliant (NC), or not applicable (NA)) as well as the C&amp;A status.</p>
<p>DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP). The DoD process for identifying, implementing, validating, certifying, and managing IA capabilities and services, expressed as IA controls, and authorizing the operation of DoD ISs, including testing in a live environment, in accordance with statutory, Federal, and DoD requirements.</p>
<p>DoD Information Technology Portfolio Repository</p>
<p>Enterprise IT Data Repository (EITDR). The Air Force database of record for registering all systems and applications as required by public law and DoD directives. Registration in the EITDR is mandatory for all systems and applications developed by the Air Force, or for which the Air Force is the lead agency, or that requires connection to the AF-GIG. The EITDR is also the database of record for IT statutory and regulatory compliance. The repository contains compliance data for Information Assurance (IA), Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), Public Key Enabling (PKE), Clinger-Cohen Act, etc. It is the primary data source for Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) reporting and the principal vehicle for gathering and storing system and application data to support planned and ad hoc data calls. The EITDR contains information about program management; system and application interfaces; networthiness; funding; Capital Investment Reports (CIRs) and other supporting data to facilitate IT portfolio management.</p>
<p>Interim Authorization to Operate (IATO). A temporary authorization to operate a DoD IS under the conditions or constraints enumerated in the accreditation decision.</p>
<p>Interim Authorization to Test (IATT). A temporary authorization to test a DoD IS in a specified operational information environment or with live data for a specified time period within the timeframe and under the conditions or constraints enumerated in the accreditation decision.</p>
<p>IT Security Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&amp;M). A permanent record that identifies tasks to be accomplished in order to resolve security weaknesses. Required for any accreditation decision that requires corrective actions, it specifies resources required to accomplish the tasks enumerated in the plan and milestones for completing the tasks. Also used to document DAA-accepted non-compliant IA controls and baseline IA controls that are not applicable. An IT Security POA&amp;M may be active or inactive throughout a system's life cycle as weaknesses are newly identified or closed.</p>
<p>Mission Assurance Category (MAC). Applicable to DoD information systems, the mission assurance category reflects the importance of information relative to the achievement of DoD goals and objectives, particularly the warfighters' combat mission. Mission assurance categories are primarily used to determine the requirements for availability and integrity. The Department of Defense has three defined mission assurance categories:</p>
<p>Mission Assurance Category I (MAC I). Systems handling information that is determined to be vital to the operational readiness or mission effectiveness of deployed and contingency forces in terms of both content and timeliness. The consequences of loss of integrity or availability of a MAC I system are unacceptable and could include the immediate and sustained loss of mission effectiveness. MAC I systems require the most stringent protection measures.</p>
<p>Mission Assurance Category II (MAC II). Systems handling information that is important to the support of deployed and contingency forces. The consequences of loss of integrity are unacceptable. Loss of availability is difficult to deal with and can only be tolerated for a short time. The consequences could include delay or degradation in providing important support services or commodities that may seriously impact mission effectiveness or operational readiness. MAC II systems require additional safeguards beyond best practices to ensure adequate assurance.</p>
<p>Mission Assurance Category III (MAC III). Systems handling information that is necessary for the conduct of day-to-day business, but does not materially affect support to deployed or contingency forces in the short-term. The consequences of loss of integrity or availability can be tolerated or overcome without significant impacts on mission effectiveness or operational readiness. The consequences could include the delay or degradation of services or commodities enabling routine activities. MAC III systems require protective measures, techniques or procedures generally commensurate with commercial best practices.</p>
<p>Validation. Activity applied throughout the system's life cycle to confirm or establish by testing, evaluation, examination, investigation, or competent evidence that a DoD IS's assigned IA controls are implemented correctly and are effective in their application.</p>
<p>Validator. Entity responsible for conducting a valadation procedure.</p>
<p>1. RFI, paragraph 72 reads today: "Users will be restricted to one active<br />logon session."<br />- Change this to read: " User should not be inherently restricted to<br />one active login session however the capability should exist."<br />- Reason for change: Original requirement was developed for user name<br />and password logins, but with PKI login, users want to be able to have more<br />than one active logon session but reserve the option to restrict to one<br />active logon in the future.</p>
<p>2. The first sentence in paragraph 66 reads: " Updates and Upgrades: Vendor<br />shall provide an acceptable mechanism (e.g., ftp or CD) to obtain C&amp;A Tool<br />updates and enhancements within a closed environment."<br />- Change this to read: " Updates and Upgrades: Vendor shall provide an<br />acceptable mechanism to obtain C&amp;A Tool updates and enhancements within a<br />closed environment."<br />- Reason for change: ftp is no longer an acceptable mechanism,<br />though secure ftp is still acceptable. Examples deleted to allow more<br />flexibility.</p>
<p>3. RFI paragraph 21 reads: " Does the solution proposed already have DIACAP <br />certification in DoD?"<br />- Change this to read: "Can the solution be DIACAP certified? Is there <br />anything preventing this certification?"<br />- Reason for change: While it is desired that the solution be DIACAP <br />certified, the more applicable question for most products is could it be <br />certified? The intent is to identify any impediments to certification.</p>

As a part of the SIR/Request for Offer (RFO), interested vendors are required to deliver LED PAPI systems that will meet the requirements of Specification FAA-E-3007 to the designated Government Test Facility not less than four months but not more than five months from the date of this announcement. An Operational Capability Test (OCT) will then take place over a two-month period to determine if the optical design meets the LED PAPI functional requirements. Based upon the OCT results, evaluation of the technical proposals, and evaluation of the cost proposals, the FAA will select the vendor whose LED PAPI system best meets the FAA requirements identified in FAA-E-3007 and the SOW. 
Phase 2 follows contract award and consists of design, build, and testing of the LED PAPI system, and development and delivery of all documents and services identified in the RFO. The FAA reserves the right to award no contract at all based on the final results of the evaluations. The FAA reserves the right to make an award to the Offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the FAA. The best value is defined as the proposal that presents the most advantageous solution to the FAA, based on the evaluation of the Offeror's Technical Proposal (Volume I), Relative Experience and Past Performance (Volume III), Operational Capability Test (OCT) results, and Price Proposal (Volume II). The best value approach provides the opportunity for technical and cost/price tradeoffs and does not require that an award be made to either the offeror submitting the highest rated technical proposal or the offeror submitting the lowest price. Contract award is anticipated within 120 days after completion of the LED PAPI system evaluation. See the attached RFO for additional proposal requirements, due dates, and delivery information.
All interested parties must submit their technical proposals, cost proposals, and a letter stating their intent to provide an operational LED PAPI for OCT, within 60 calendar days from the date of this announcement
Prospective offerors are hereby given notice that any amendment(s) issued to this solicitation will be published at http://faaco.faa.gov/ under current announcements for FAA Headquarters, Washington, DC. It is the offerors responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement.
The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with preparation of responses to this SIR and will not reimburse or otherwise pay equipment costs incurred by any party responding. The FAA will provide 30 calendar days from the date of this announcement for questions/comments. Questions concerning this SIR must be in writing and should be addressed to the FAA LED PAPI Contracting Officer, Mr. Brian Anderson, by email to Brian.Anderson@faa.gov. The FAA will not respond to telephonic requests for information. FAA responses to questions, excluding vendor name, will be made public and published at http://faaco.faa.gov/ under current announcements for FAA Headquarters, Washington, DC.

<DESC>This is modification 4 to the synopsis entitled HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SUPPORTINGTHE MAKER PROJECT under NNJ09298123Q which was posted on July 20, 2009. The purpose ofthis modification is to post the following updated Statement of Work (SOW) reflective ofthe questions and answers below:http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/NNJ09298123Q/SOW-Updated-10-9-09.rtf Question #1: In Section 3.3.3 (Variable Frequency Drives), I need an example of such acommercially available product and the use of the AC voltage output for the use indriving the DC motors. Also why is variable frequency required instead of using thestandard 50 or 60Hz AC voltage?Answer #1: "DC" is a typo.  Correct requirement includes "AC".	Variable Frequency Drivesare being used to control speeds on various accessories such as spool feeders for wirefeedstock or a spindle for traditional subtractive machining finishing passes.	Question #2: In Section 3.3.8 about the Manual Override for VFD control, what AC power isavailable when the VFD is manually overidden in order to power the system?Answer #2: The Manual Override is a physical control knob that can be used to adjust theoutput frequency of the VFD in lieu of software based control.	It does not presupposethat the VFD has been turned off and does not negate the requirement for software basedcontrol capability, rather it simply provides an alternative way of controlling the VFD'soutput.Question #3: In Section 2.1.3 (Z-Axis Over Travel Limit Switches), if  the limit switchfails, is there a current sense on the linear actuators to be monitored in order toprevent damage to the electronics or equipment for a hard stop?Answer #3: No, the maximum stepper motor voltage/amperage is specified, and the vendorsupplied motor drives must facilitate current limiting to protect the motor in case thelimit switch fails.  In the event this maximum rating is achieved, the vendor suppliedcontrol software must "alarm out", alert the user/operator what axis has reached limit,and provide for resetting/restarting of the failed operation at the point of failure (orthe beginning of the motion control command that failure occurred within).The due date for responses is extended to October 19, 2009.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  Thesedocuments will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWWbrowser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunitieshome page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73     Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation andany amendments.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.
Amendment: 0006 
This amendment is being issued for release of a draft performance specification to illicit comments from industry to further shape the specification prior to release of solicitation. 
PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND:  Announcement N00164-06-R-4810 was released in September 2006 to determine potential sources for day/night sight aiming capabilities compatible with the M2HB weapon system.  The SOPMOD/WPNAC Program Office is releasing the approved performance specification for industry and academia questions in anticipation of the forthcoming Request for Proposal.  The MDNS-CSW project is envisioned to be a two phase effort:  Phase One, which is an analog controlled system, and Phase Two, which provides a digital control and targeting system.  Phase one consists of several independent subsystems which provide improved aiming and illumination capabilities for crew served weapons.  All subsystem operational modes are controlled at the subsystem housing; however, combat critical controls are operated from a remote analog switch location.  Phase Two is an incrementally developed system that will provide multi-spectral targeting information with disturbed reticle aiming technology providing increased accuracy over static reticle/stadia sighting systems.  This system will create an interconnected illumination and targeting system providing integrated control of all subsystem components from the spade grip housing.  The purpose of this announcement is to expand upon the requirements for MDNS-CSW Phase One and continue dialogue with industry and academia to clarify those requirements as necessary.      
OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this announcement is to release a draft performance specification for MDNS-CSW Phase One with the intent to elicit comment from industry and academia to help further shape the specification before solicitation.  The Closing Date for receipt of questions on the revised draft MDNS-CSW Phase One performance specification is Tuesday, 10 November 2009.
For those in industry to fully understand the system of interest, the SOPMOD/Weapons Accessories Program Office would like to extend an invitation to those in industry to view the MK93 mount and M2HB weapon system at NSWC Crane.  This invitation extends from 09 October, 2009 until 10 November, 2009.  While with the system, vendors are encouraged to take any necessary measurements to help formulate their response to this sources sought.  To arrange a time to view the system, vendors should contact Mr. Sam Spears, 812-854-8766.  The U. S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.                
PARTICIPATION:  Failure to provide written feedback to the revised draft performance specification will not preclude abstaining vendors from bidding on possible future solicitations.  This announcement is part of the full-, free-, and open- competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape Government specifications to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to provide written feedback may result in a future Government performance specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct early interaction with contracting officials and acquisition planners.
ADDITIONAL NOTES:  It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Weapons System Technology Integration Center (WSTIAC), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), and other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.  
This announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U. S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.  Any information provided that is marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  Your interest is this program is appreciated.
Questions should be directed to Mr. Dennis Ball, Contracting Officer, Code 0562NS, telephone 812-854-2129, fax 812-854-5095, e-mail dennis.ball@navy.mil or Mr. J.

<DESC>RECOVERY--Description Changed To:The Philadelphia District, Corps of Engineers, is issuing a negotiated, best value RFP (Request for Proposal) acquisition under Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations to acquire a microgrid to replace spot generators with prime power generators, with some utility-like controls, set up as a power plant. This will require the successful offeror to first grid FOB Denver (located 1.0 hour from main NTC post, terrain-rough, with specific location to be determined, and establish the infrastructure. The power plant or microgrid will be configured for power to be delivered based on actual demand, not peak demand for the overall system. Design will allow for the future addition of renewable energy (solar, wind, and/or battery storage). The selected offeror will be required to provide all necessary tools, materials, and equipment and qualified labor to install a 1MW power generation system connected to the grid, inclusive of underground cabling, step down and step up transformers, panel boxes as necessary as well as paralleling gear with load sequencing capabilities (turning on/off generators). The power distribution system or microgrid will provide 480vac, 208vac, and 110/120vac to meet all power requirements. In order to be eligible for award, prices must be submitted on for all major components to each line item. Failure to submit pricing detail for all major components/categories may cause rejection of the offer. Proposals will be evaluated for completeness in satisfying the requirements of the RFP. The proposals will be ranked on the basis of the following factors: (a) past performance and experience, (b) technical ability (comprised of contractor submitted proprietary drawings, contractor furnished equipment/product listings/catalogs), (c) management plan, with locations of the offerors primary place of business and field offices, (d) mobilization/ set up schedule, (e) extent of subcontracting, and (f) price. Technical ability is slightly more important than past performance and experience, mobilization/set-up schedules, both of which are of equal weight and more important than the extent of subcontracting. The technical factors when combined are more important that price; however, price remains a significant factor. This is an unrestricted procurement. The applicable NAICS code is 221119, with a size standard of 4 million megawatt hours, (a firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and/or distribution of electric energy for sale and its total electric output for the preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours). The solicitation will be issued on, or about, 11 AUG 2009 with proposals due by 3:00 p.m., local time, 24 August 2009. Hard copy quotes are to be delivered to the Corps of Engineers, Wanamaker Building, Room 643, 100 Penn Square East, Philadelphia, PA 19107-3390 ATTN: Mr. Edward A. Boddie. [POC: e-mail edward.a.boddie@usace.army.mil] Solicitation documents, plans and specifications will only be available via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) homepage located at https://www.fbo.gov/. Offerors may view and/or download the solicitation and all amendments from the Internet on (or after) the issue date. Registration for plans and specs should be made via FBO Internet homepage. Hardcopies will not be available and no written or fax requests will be accepted. If any offeror information changes during the advertisement period, offerors are responsible to make changes to their user profile on the Internet. Failure to make changes in their user profile may cause a delay in receiving the solicitation and any amendments. Offerors are responsible for printing paper copies of the solicitation. Bonding is not required. All offerors must be registered in the DoDs Central Contract Register before award, as required by DFARS 204.7300 and, for US firms, must comply with VETS-100 annual reporting as required by FAR 22.1310(b).

<AWARDEE>JAMES F TAYLOR, 16821 BRIARDALE ROAD, DERWOOD, MD 20855-2034 US
<DESC>This project is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the act.
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), OER, NIH, is responsible for the general administration and implementation of the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (PHS Policy). The Policy was promulgated in 1986 to implement the Health Research Extension Act of 1985 and requires institutions to establish and maintain proper measures to ensure the appropriate care and use of all animals involved in research, research training, and biological testing activities conducted or supported by the PHS. OLAW is responsible for the general administration and coordination of the Policy on behalf of the PHS.</p>
<p>Administration of the PHS Policy includes review of the Vertebrate Animal Section (VAS) of the PHS 398 grant application for those projects involving the use of live vertebrate animals in research. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of grants requiring review by OLAW personnel. This requirement leaves OLAW with the immediate need for professional support and expertise in handling NIH grant issues related to the appropriate completion of the VAS of the PHS 398 by extramural scientists.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>Provide professional staff support to the OLAW Division of Assurances on site or remotely for approximately 20 hours per month, for up to 12 months, from the date of award with one additional option year. Because of ARRA restrictions this contract may not exceed 2 years and may be terminated with 30 days written notice by the government or the contractor.</p>
<p>Required Tasks</p>
<p>&bull; Review and analyze Vertebrate Animal Sections of PHS 398 grant application documents for the Division of Assurances. Tasks will include review of grants documents for appropriateness of sections describing animal use and communicate with OLAW personnel and support staff. <br />&bull; Review grant data in IMPACII associated with requests from IC grants managers and specialists to provide or obtain data necessary to make award (ie, communicate through NIH grants officers, and grants management personnel to receive updated information from the grant applicant). <br />&bull; Meet with OLAW Division of Assurances Director in person or via telephone if necessary to discuss grant review and responses.</p>
<p><br />Place of Performance</p>
<p>Primary work site is the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, OLAW office, 6705 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20817. Some work may be performed remotely.</p>
<p>Performance Period</p>
<p>12 months from date of award with one additional one year option.<br /><br />Reporting/Deliverables</p>
<p>Review documents:<br />&bull; for completeness of vertebrate animal components<br />&bull; identify missing components<br />&bull; to ensure they meet the requirements of <br />o PHS Policy <br />o the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals <br />o AVMA Guidelines for Euthanasia<br />o The Animal Welfare Act and Regulations<br />&bull; list clarifications necessary to attain completed document <br />Prepare correspondence requesting clarification<br />Review updated responses and acknowledge acceptance of document to administrative personnel, program official and/or grant management.</p>
<p>American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) Unique Reporting Requirements:</p>
<p>FAR Clause 52.204-11, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act--Reporting Requirements (March 2009)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>Contract, as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16.</p>
<p>First-tier subcontract means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act.</p>
<p>Jobs created means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter.</p>
<p>Jobs retained means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter.</p>
<p>Total compensation means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractor's past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)):</p>
<p>(1) Salary and bonus.<br />(2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments.<br />(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees.<br />(4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans.<br />(5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified.<br />(6) Other compensation. For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public.</p>
<p>(c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at http://www.FederalReporting.gov.</p>
<p>(1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable.<br />(2) The amount of Recovery Act funds invoiced by the contractor for the reporting period.

This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act.<br />(7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractor's workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide-</p>
<p>(i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). This description may rely on job titles, broader labor categories, or the contractor's existing practice for describing jobs as long as the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and<br />(ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas.

<p>(B) The public does not have access to information about the compensation of the senior executives through periodic reports filed under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)) or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.<br />The following FAR provisions and clauses sited herein are also incorporated by reference into this solicitation.

Description of Action: Approval is requested to award a follow-on contract for Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) certification and recertification for the Department of Combat Medic Training (DCMT) and the U.S. Army Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Program Management Office.  Type of contract anticipated is an IDIQ using DHP funds.<BR><BR>3. Description of Supplies/Services: The objective is to provide Armys DCMT and EMS personnel with the services necessary to process application package requests. The contractor shall provide all appropriate administrative support, specific printed material and grade sheets, as required, to process the application and certification packages.  The process shall include grading the written or computer tests, establishing a certificate number, issuing a certificate, wallet card, and a shoulder patch.

Actions to Increase Competition:  Due to the specific nature of the requirement outlined in AR 40-68, no further action to increase competition is contemplated. The requiring activity will continue to monitor the market for this type of service and keep current on AR 40-68 updates concerning this policy.  If additional sources are later authorized to provide the national registry indicated by agency regulations, future requirements will be included in any subsequent competitive acquisitions. <BR><BR>8.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1(c)
<DESC><p>Department of the Air Force<br />55th Contracting Squadron<br />Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska</p>
<p>Limited Sources Justification<br />For<br />Acquisition of Google Earth Server Licenses and Support</p>
<p>I. Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>Department of the Air Force, Air Combat Command, 55th Contracting Squadron, Offutt AFB, NE is the contracting organization responsible for the individual justification for other than full and open competition. The Contracting Officer is Mrs. Sheila M. Rollins, DSN 271-5142.</p>
<p>II. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:</p>
<p>This limited sources justification authorizes the use of other than full and open competition procedures for the Department of Defense (DoD). This requirement provides for acquisition of Google Earth server software licenses and related support to HQ Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). The scope of this J&amp;A is for an initial purchase of initial licenses, along with an agency effort to consolidate any contractor A&amp;A/S purchases and maintenance costs for a discounted rate. The initial software license is expected to consist of the following Google Earth licenses (but not limited to): Google Earth Fusion Server, Google Earth Server (NIPRNet, SIPRNet, JWICS), Google Earth Data World, Google Earth Terrain Data World, Google Earth Development/Test Server, and Google Earth Server, user mobile. This J&amp;A will allow for an agency effort to consolidate purchases at AFWA to negotiate a discounted rate for the United States Air Force. The ceiling for this limited sources justification is $3.5M. The scope for this J&amp;A is limited to a one year period.</p>
<p>III. Description of the Supplies/Services:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide AFWA Google Earth server software licenses and related support for AFWA purposes, including 2-D/3D satellite, maps and terrain imagery.</p>
<p>IV. Statutory Authority:</p>
<p>Multiple Award Schedule Program: Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251, et seq.) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies; Limitation of Sources, FAR 8.405-6(b)(1), only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the requirement (see Section V for detailed justification).</p>
<p><br />V. Applicability of Authority:</p>
<p>Google Earth software is needed to interoperate with / match Google Earth capabilities currently employed within Air Force Air and Space Operation Centers, Air Force Operations Group, and other operational environments. The provision of other disparate capability platforms would not allow AFWA's net-centric, service oriented architecture (SOA) developers to build to the operational users' current environment and would stifle standardization of user-consumable services extended to mission planning/command and control applications. Google Earth is the sole software suite that has the capability to operate on the Air Force NIPRNet. The government may not rely on the public internet for operational platforms. Neither the Microsoft Virtual Earth suite nor the NASA World Wind software have accreditation to operate on the Air Force NIPRNet, but rely on the public internet.</p>
<p>A sources sought announcement was posted on www.fbo.gov for duration of ten days. Two responses were received, from ESRI and Onix Networking. ESRI recommended a full end to end Geographical Information System (GIS) solution based around its ArcGIS Server software. Onix proposed a Google Earth (GE) installation consisting of the software licenses listed in paragraph II.</p>
<p>AFWA evaluated the ESRI recommendation and determined that the ArcGIS server software will not satisfy the government's requirements for mapping and terrain capabilities that are offered by Google Earth. AFWA already has access to a full ArcGIS Server solution through the use of the Commercial Joint Mapping Toolkit application (C/JMTK), and has no need for a redundant ArcGIS suite or full GIS solution to deliver more than 2D globe support. AFWA already has established service based data delivery and discovery methods through the ArcGIS suite and other application software already in house.</p>
<p>The Onix proposal offers a Google Earth solution through its GSA Schedule contract, and would meet the government's requirements.</p>
<p>VI. Efforts to Obtain Competition:</p>
<p>A sources sought announcement was published on www.fbo.gov on 29 June 2009 and closed 10 July 2009. The announcement included the required capabilities of the software solution.</p>
<p>VII. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost</p>
<p>The Government compared ONIX Network price quote, ranging from $8,000 to $100,000,with Northrop Grumman SEMS II order that included a mixture of Google Earth licenses. Listed below is the comparison of NG SEMS II Order with Onix.</p>
<p>The Government intends to request for the best discount in accordance with ACC Contracting Mandatory Procedures Subpart 5308 available from Onix's GSA Schedule. Placing an order through a GSA schedule contract provides the best value to the government.</p>
<p>VIII. Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:</p>
<p>Google provided initial information about its Google Earth server software capabilities, and offered standard GSA pricing. However, Google itself does not have a GSA Schedule Contract, but relies on other companies who sell its product lines. Google Earth products meet all the government's requirements, and are available via GSA schedule contracts.</p>
<p>IX. Market Research:</p>
<p>AFWA/CCX conducted market research on Google Earth, Microsoft Virtual Earth and NASA World Wind software products. AFWA's research consisted of interviews, demonstrations, and Q&amp;A with various companies. Research on Microsoft Virtual Earth revealed a dependency on the public network, limited extensibility, and a fee structure that required user counting (not standard, difficult to cost). A Microsoft Live Meeting was conducted in April with Microsoft Virtual Earth; the consensus from this technical interchange meeting was that Microsoft's Virtual Earth application didn't meet AFWA's requirements because of its dependency on the public network, limited extensibility, and fee structure. NASA World Wind (government-owned product) is free, highly extensible and meets some AFWA requirements. However, NASA World Wind does not present a complete solution because of its dependency on public networks and servers, and therefore, does not meet AFWA requirements. Neither MS Virtual Earth nor NASA World Wind has client accreditation to operate on AF NIPRNet, and accreditation would not be provided for at least 6-12 months. However, this is a secondary impediment, and does not overcome the fact that neither MS Virtual Earth nor NASA World Wind meets AFWA requirements.</p>
<p>The Google Earth solution includes a server that would negate the need to rely on publicly accessible servers, is a complete solution, and meets AFWA's requirement.</p>
<p>Several other GSA Schedule contracts were researched and found unsatisfactory to meet the required needs of the Government, either because they did not provide all the necessary Google licenses, or because they offered different products with different capabilities. Six companies have GSA schedule contracts that provide Google products; however, only Onix Networking provided exactly the software licenses required.</p>
<p>X. Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, any interest in the acquisition:</p>
<p>Google provided market research pricing in several formats, to include software products, installation, on-site support, on-site training, and additional training in the Reston, VA office.<br />ESRI provided a proposal in response to the sources sought announcement.<br />Onix Networking provided a proposal in response to the sources sought announcement.</p>
<p>XI. Statement of Actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:</p>
<p>The government will continue to conduct market research into capabilities/products that would meet future requirements. Research includes attending meetings/conferences/<br />symposia that discuss future solutions or products. The government may also pursue accreditation of the NASA product through DISA.</p>
<p>XII. Contracting Officer Certification:</p>
<p>The contracting officer's signature on this Limited Sources Justification and Review Document coordination and approval cover page evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>XIII. Technical Representative's Certification:</p>
<p>The technical and/or requirements personnel signature on this Limited Sources Justification and Review Document coordination and approval cover page evidences that he/she has certified that the data contained herein, within his/her responsibility, is both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief.</p>
