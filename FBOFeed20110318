The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541712 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The Government has a need to purchase Innovative HIPIMS (high power impulse magnetron sputtering) technology based on ionized PVD physics.  HIPIMS produces ion fluxes with high concentrations of metal target ion, which can be used to sputter-remove contamination from the surface and implant metal ions in the substrate, promoting strong bonding of the coatings to the substrate.    This proposed contract action requires Sheffield Hallam University to apply HIPIMS etching and deposition technology so that substantial duplication costs are not incurred by the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), to negotiate/award a purchase order to HighRes Biosolutions, Inc., 299 Washington Street, Woburn, MA 01801 for the purchase of one High-Throughput Pin Transfer Tool.
<p>The NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) intends to purchase a 1536-Well Pintool, for low-volume, high precision liquid transfer. This instrument is needed to deliver library compounds to high-density format assays established by NCGC. The implementation of existing technology and protocols will ensure the highest levels of accuracy and experimental efficiency across all assays under the Tox21 team.</p>
<p>The MicroPin pintool is a fully programmable workstation. The programming information (operation type, number of dips, etc.) is stored in files called methods. Methods can be started manually (by the operator) on the on-line and off-line pintool and automatically (by the dispatcher) on the on-line system. The pinhead contains 1536 pins, each with 10nl slots. The pins float in a teflon coated pintool head frame. They are unconstrained in the vertical axis and are held down only by gravity. The pin head can be easily removed and has manual adjustments for rotation around the z-axis and tilt (pitch and roll). The notched-pin system is identical to those used by the NCGC laboratory and is needed to reproduce performance and protocol transfer between the assays within this group as well as other NCGC lab areas. Assays can be developed on the stand-alone workstations and easily transferred to integrated qHTS systems. This improves screen consistency and quality, enabling a seamless transition of assays from the bench to the full automation. This station includes a programmable re-circulating solvent, ultrasonic wash system to minimize pin tool cross-contamination of assay plates and compound libraries. <br /><br />Some of these key features of the system are:<br />* 96, 384 or 1536 compatible<br />* Volume transfer range: 5nL - 0.5&mu;L<br />* Two- or three-step wash process available with sonication or plasma cleaning<br />* Integrated blot station to dry pins<br />* Hydrophobic slotted pins available<br />* Safe to transfer to plates with cell lines<br />* Moving tray design allows robot to load plates during transfer<br />* Two reagent sequential wash or stations available<br />* Compatible with MicroCart<sup>TM</sup> and MicroDock<sup>TM</sup><br />* Automation friendly with easy-to-use integrators' kit</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based upon the fact that this pin transfer station has specifications as close to the current online and offline pin transfer stations used by the NCGC laboratory with a proven track record of performance, and is needed to deliver compound solutions volumetrically from prepared compound library plates to assay plates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Nikon Instruments, Inc., 1300 Walt Whitman Road, Floor 2, Melville, NY 11747-3001 for a software upgrade of the following equipment:</p>
<p>-	D-Eclipse C1 Confocal Microscope</p>
<p>The D-Eclipse C1 Confocal Microscope is heavily used by multiple investigators in the NIDCR.  A software upgrade is necessary since the laboratory is currently using the original software that was provided with the equipment when originally purchased in 2003.  Since the equipment still performs as it should, the new software upgrade will be very beneficial to research activities being conducted.</p>
<p>The sole source justification is based on the fact that this upgrade must be compatible to the existing equipment that is currently in place in the NIDCR.  The software is also proprietary to Nikon Instruments, Inc., and only the manufacturer is authorized to provide and install it.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 333314, Optical Instrument and Lens Manufacturing, and is not a small business set aside. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-49 (January 24, 2011).</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by March 22, 2011 at 12:00pm Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.</p>
<p>Inquiries to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(DE)-2011-139-JML, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions,   COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6151, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Jonathan Lear.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with PA Consulting Group, Inc., 4601 N Fairfax Drive, Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22203-1546 for Modeling and Simulation Analysis Services necessary to support the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office (JSFPO). Requirements include the following areas: Technical Program Support; Program Management Support; Specific Analysis Support; Program Data Assessment Support; Program-wide Assessment Support; Program Management Modeling System (PMMS) Refinement and Calibration Support; and PMMS Modeling Simulation, and Analysis. The Government intends to procure the above service under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The period of performance on this procurement will be one-year from date of award, with two (2) one-year option periods.
<p>The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) (F-35) program is a joint DoD ACAT 1D major acquisition program that includes the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps. JSF also includes eight foreign partner countries formally identified as Cooperative Partner Participants (CPP) along with two other countries called Security Cooperative Participants (SCP). PA Consulting Group is the only source that can currently perform follow-on program simulation analyses without substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delay. PA Consulting Group, Inc. is currently supplying the support services for this requirement, utilizing a proprietary F-35 Simulation Software that the contractor developed independently. Replacing PA Consulting Group, Inc. with a new contractor would result in the necessity of developing an entirely new modeling software system, redevelopment of the F-35 program analysis capability, redevelopment of the modeling system, the need to test and prove validity of the analysis results, loss of continuity and context, and duplicated effort to gather data and gain familiarity on data sources. PA Consulting Group, Inc., having the knowledge of F-35 proprietary performance data makes them uniquely qualified to perform further modeling, simulation and analysis in greater detail to simulate and analyze F-35 activities. The impact of failing to award this continued support for the JSF program is both operational and financial. Given the urgent need for high quality program analyses during the next two year replanning period, it is important to continue PA Consulting Group's analysis efforts without an interruption in deliverables. A potential gap would impact the program office's ability to review aircraft contractors plans against PMMS outlook simulations, continue to systematically track changes in program baseline against the 50,000-equation tailored simulation model and related databases, cross check important assumptions, and appropriately assess risks and mitigations in a timely manner. PA Consulting Group's analysis efforts are currently feeding into capability reviews, air system software assessments, production capacity analyses, and analysis of other high priority, critical issues. These efforts/products support all product Integrated Product Teams and Senior Leadership decision making. Furthermore, there is a financial impact to disrupting the JSFPO Operations, because a re-start after a stoppage will lead to duplication of costs that will not be recovered.</p>

This procurement will provide for up to 1,350 Low Rate Initial Production Systems, Spares, Training, Field Support, and associated Data in support of the Joint Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (JCREW) Program.  The Navy awarded  Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts in 1QFY10 for JCREW I1B1 (formerly JCREW 3.3) to ITT Electronics System Inc., 3500 Willow Lane, Thousand Oaks, California and Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation Network Communication Systems, One Rancho Carmel, San Diego California.
 The EDM contract contained options for Preliminary Design Review (PDR), Critical Design Review (CDR), and Engineering Design Review (EDM). The Navys intent was to award a sole source LRIP contract to the offeror whose EDM Option was exercised. After the completion of the CDR Phase, the Navy exercised EDM Option for ITT ES, making ITT ES, the only offeror capable of developing the EDMs into LRIP systems. The LRIP systems will provide Production Representative Articles (PRA) for the statutory Operational Testing (OT), support Initial Operational Capability (IOC), and to validate the system production package for the JCREW I1B1 system. The intent of the Navy is to use the validated production package to compete the full rate production contract.
 


Delivery of the initial systems will be required within 5 months after award of contract contract, with subsequent monthly deliveries.  The period of performance is anticipated to run from contract award in third quarter Government Fiscal Year 2012 through fourth quarter Government Fiscal Year 2014. Contract Performance will be conducted at the Contractor facilities. All responsible and capable sources may submit a capability statement within this synopsis response due date and it will be considered by the Government.  Reference solicitation number N00024-11-R-6300. The Navy anticipates issuing a solicitation for this procurement the third quarter of FY11. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
  Responses to this notice must be received by 12:00 p.m. local time on 8 April 2011.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Vanessa Ochomogo (vanessa.ochomogo@navy.mil) and copy to George K.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has a requirement for one Engineering Model Main Reflector, three flight Main Reflectors, three flight Cold Sky Reflectors, and the corresponding Ground Support Equipment as defined in the Statement of Work. These items are for the Microwave Imager/Sounder (MIS) payload as part of a larger Class 1 Operational National Program. The Main Reflector is an offset parabolic reflector that focuses scene energy that is collected and processed by the spacecraft's systems. The Cold Sky Reflector is a parabolic reflector that provides a view of cold (~2.7 K) space that is collected and processed by the spacecraft's systems. The measurements from the Cold Sky Reflector enable the systems to calibrate on each scan. The Specifications are export controlled under the International Traffic In Arms Regulation (ITAR). As such, in order to receive the referenced specifications, potential contractors must complete the attached certification with proof of status as a US Person (as defined in 22 C.F.R. Part 120.15) and submit it via email to Kirsten Pilkerton at kirsten.pilkerton@nrl.navy.mil. Upon confirmation of eligibility and the release of the solicitation, potential offerors will be sent copies of the statement of work and specifications. The statement of work and specifications must be safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with applicable US export control laws and regulations. It is anticipated that a&nbsp;Firm Fixed Price&nbsp;contract will be made as a result of the solicitation. NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued. <br />
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The DoD and the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) have a requirement for a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pharmacotherapeutic(s) for the treatment of Combat Related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  PTSD may result from exposure to a variety of stressors/events.  However, this solicitation specifically addresses PTSD associated with combat related to service in support of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF).  The objective is a safe and efficacious FDA approved product(s) with minimal side effects that can be used to treat PTSD in two populations of service members and veterans with PTSD diagnosed using the criteria in the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).  The first population is service members and veterans with combat related PTSD of less than one year duration, while the second population is service members and veterans with PTSD of greater than or equal to one year duration.  For the purpose of this RFP, these two populations include any service member with a diagnosis of PTSD incurred while on active duty status and deployed in support of OEF/OIF.  OEF/OIF veterans diagnosed with PTSD who are not presently on active duty (e.g., retired, discharged, reserve status, etc.) are included in the populations identified above.  PTSD is a serious issue in combat troops and veterans, and a new pharmacotherapeutic agent(s) to address PTSD is urgently needed.  Therefore, the starting TRL is extremely important.  Preference will be given to promising mature products such as those already FDA approved for another indication in order to reduce the developmental time line.  Selected efforts will specifically address development of a pharmacotherapeutic(s) from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 6 through completion of all requirements in TRL 8, as described in Attachment 1:  Pharmacotherapeutic Technical Readiness Level (TRL) Achievement Form, or online in Appendix E of the Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) Deskbook at: http://www.dod.mil/ddre/doc/DoD_TRA_July_2009_Read_Version.pdf.<BR>DELIVERABLES should be identified by the Offeror in the proposal and at minimum should include:	1)Letters to the Government giving full rights of access to the data and information in Contractors IND and any applicable drug master file prepared using the data collected during the contract period; 2) Project Management Plan that defines project scope, activities and schedule and which includes: (a)Integrated Master Schedule; (b)Risk Management Plan; (c)FDA Regulatory Plan; 3) Quality Assurance Plan; 4) Participate in Monthly Teleconferences; 5) Quarterly Reports; 6) Annual Report; 7) Clinical Study and Statistical Analysis Plans; 8) Collection and Analysis Data Base; 9) Copies of all Documents submitted to the FDA to include the IND, NDA/sNDA, all correspondence between the FDA and Offeror related to the funded development of the pharmacotherapeutic; and 10)Annual Meeting.  The Government reserves the right to award one or multiple contracts as a result of this solicitation. Any resulting contract(s)will be issued based on best value to the U. S. Army.  It is anticipated that a cost contract(s)will be awarded.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>Notice Type: 
Solicitation (Request for Architect - Engineer Qualifications)

Synopsis: 
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, is seeking architecture or architecture/engineering firm (NAICS 541310) capable of the planning and design of newly constructed and renovated hospitals, large outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, health care and biomedical research, and similarly complex healthcare projects.  The  architecture or architecture/engineering firm must be capable of preparing all design and construction documentation including, but not limited to, advance/master planning, site development, utility infrastructure design, local utility approval, architecture, medical planning, civil engineering, structural engineering including seismic design, mechanical engineering, historic preservation, environmental protection, communication and data engineering, electrical engineering, interior design, landscape design, commissioning, construction cost estimating and market research, parking and traffic studies, geotechnical investigation and surveying, seismic design for new and existing buildings.  The prime contractor should have, at least, the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines as members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Architects, Medical Planners, Structural Engineers, Seismic Design Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Geo-technical Engineers, Historic Preservation Architects, Environmental Engineers, Communications and Electrical Engineers, Interior Designers, Sustainable Design and LEED Accredited Professionals, and Cost Estimators. All members should have experience in the planning and design of new hospitals (incorporating the Planetree Patient-Centered Care model), large medical and significant outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, medical research facilities, or similar complex healthcare projects.

Scope:
This project proposes to seismically correct Building 500, construct a new bed tower, add parking structures, expand the energy plant to support new construction, design energy saving enhancements, infrastructure, utility, and site improvements to support new construction and renovation, and site work. It will also seismically retrofit Building 501, the facility's chiller plant.  Upon completion of the multiple phases of this project, the services currently provided in the North Campus buildings will be relocated to the newly modernized and seismically strengthened Building 500, to the tower and/or new service support buildings, making the North Campus buildings available for a potential Enhanced-Use Lease to develop housing for Veterans and help eliminate Veteran homelessness, or other VA use.  

The project will require a comprehensive facility site plan and space plan.  The project will also require an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement (as appropriate), a historic preservation determination, mitigation work, community outreach and public meetings.  

Additional parking will be required for the campus in surface and structured parking to reduce the current space deficiency.  

Seismic design will adhere to VA's manual for Seismic Design Requirements (H-18-8).  Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, water reduction,  energy efficiency and low energy building  design; additionally, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manuals.  The project will be required to attain a minimum LEED Silver certification.  Renewable and innovative energy systems will be required as part of this project.  Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems, etc. will meet current codes and standards. All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VA's criteria as detailed in its Physical Security Design Manual for VA Facilities, both Life-Safety Protected and Mission Critical Facilities. The design will be required to comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and PG-18-13 in all areas. Required services will include preparation of equipment and furniture plans and schedules, schematics design, design development, and construction documents (both plans and specifications), medical and research equipment planning, site design, and including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a firm estimate of construction cost.  

The estimated price range for construction project is more than $100,000,000. At this time it is anticipated that the Seismic Retrofit of Buildings 500 and the New Bed Tower, could follow the design-bid-build delivery method while the Parking Garage, Energy Plant Expansion, Infrastructure Improvements, Site Work, Seismic Retrofit of Building 501 and service support building design could follow the design-build delivery method.  Once a thorough analysis of the user's and the facility's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different design delivery method, to include integrated design and construct.  The base contract for schematic design will include options for: design development documents, construction documents, construction period services, site visits, and other professional services.

Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities similar to that proposed will be considered.  Additional tasks may include site analysis and campus master plan.  Emphasis will be placed on previous successful experience with construction and renovations of medical facilities, along with the requisite Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures, additionally cost and scope management capabilities will be examined.  In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation per the VA BIM Guide.  The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology.  Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.  The design for all parts of this project are required to meet all national, state, and local building codes, regulations, and standards as well as all VA design guides and design requirements.  All VA design guides and requirements can be found online at:  http://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/.  Where conflicts occur between VA standards and model codes, the most stringent requirement shall govern.

In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  A market study to include Project Labor Agreements and an estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The phases include Schematic Design 1, Schematic Design 2, Design Development 1, Design Development 2, and Construction Documents.  The selected team shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction at time of award.  More design submission requirements can be found in VA Guide PG-18-15.

Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.

<DESC><strong>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE</strong>
<p><strong>Notice Number: HHS-NIH-NCI-SBSS-TSB-17021-82</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title: Data Center for the Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer </strong></p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) project is a new requirement. This Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to complete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this Notice and the draft Statement of Work to familiarize themselves with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The role of the Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer (CPTC) Data Center (DC) and the CPTC-Portal is to support and coordinate the data and metadata that will be generated in Phase II of the CPTC. To address many of the critical challenges facing the protein biomarker community, the NCI launched Phase I of the CPTC in 2006. The overall goals of CPTC Phase I were focused on removing several of the major barriers in proteomics research to enable the accurate, efficient and reproducible identification, and quantification of meaningful numbers of proteins that could drive high value clinical biomarker qualification studies. Phase II of the program will apply these foundational elements to discover and verify protein (and peptide) biomarkers and support the further improvement and development of robust proteomic technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives: </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns including HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</p>
<p>As a result of this SBSS Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Small Business Sources Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to develop and support the CPTC data center and data portal. During the performance of this project, 4 to 6 tumor types will be characterized by the Proteome Characterization Centers (PCCs) using a variety of platforms and experimental approaches to molecularly characterize cancer cells. Specific tasks to be performed under this project as defined under Section 5 of the attached Statement of Work are:</p>
<p>1. Project Management <br />2. System Requirements Gathering, Architecture, and Design<br />3. Deployment Plan<br />4. Domain Model, Data Elements, and Terminology Selection and Specification<br />5. System Implementation<br />6. Quality Management System<br />7. Reporting<br />8. Staff Training<br />9. Data Collection and Processing<br />10. Data Persistence and Distribution<br />11. caBIG&reg; Compliance<br />12. Data Use, Disclosure, and Handling of Sensitive Information<br />13. Documentation of Software<br />14. Transition Plan</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>1. Design, build, specify, enhance, test, deploy, and support the CPTC DC, targeted to centrally store and coordinate data produced by PCCs and coordinate CPTC data with that of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) on corresponding samples.</p>
<p>2. Establish and execute standard operating procedures (SOPs) for data transmission from PCCs to the DC. SOPs will be developed in collaboration with representatives from PCCs and Resource Center (RC). DC will play a coordinating role among various PCCs generating similar data and will be the final arbiter for definition of standard formats.</p>
<p>3. Design and implement data analysis procedures that perform quality checks on incoming data and report anomalies and non-conforming data to the data source sites.</p>
<p>4. Train a representative from each PCC and RC with appropriate SOPs for data transmission and procedures for addressing non-conforming data.</p>
<p>5. Implement a data management pipeline to process data and prepare it for public distribution in formats and systems that are consistent with compatibility guideline defined by the caBIG&reg; program.</p>
<p>6. Post the data to the publicly accessible distribution points after quality check and processing are completed and that NCI's data release policy guidelines have been followed and cleared.</p>
<p>7. Design, build, specify, enhance, test, deploy and support the CPTC Data Portal, targeted to basic and clinical researchers for browsing and downloading subsets of data that are selected based upon various characteristics of data provenance, source, and content. The CPTC Portal shall display data from the CPTC project and other sources.</p>
<p>8. Provide regular and detailed reports of the status of the CPTC data, data quality, and data usage at all stages of the data management pipeline.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance: </strong></p>
<p>The period of performance for this requirement will be a one-year base period with four (4) successive one-year options, for a total of five years if all options are exercised. The anticipated start date is on/or about September 29, 2011.</p>

<p>Design Submission Requirements<br />If your firm is selected to participate as a finalist in this competition, you will be asked to provide three 32 x 40 inch boards (vertically oriented) containing at a minimum:<br />&bull; A general context plan that incorporates your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A longitudinal north-south section across the Ellipse from the 16th Street and Constitution Avenue entrance to the White House grounds incorporating your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; An illustrative site plan at 1/16 inch scale;<br />&bull; At least one section through E Street at 1/2 inch scale focusing on landscaping, lighting and street furniture and incorporating the USSS security requirements;<br />&bull; At least two ground-level perspectives of your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A brief narrative describing your solution with a focus on innovative ways in which you have reconciled the required security measures with the spirit and guidelines of the historic cultural landscape of President's Park South.</p>
<p>Program and Design Criteria<br />The National Park Service (NPS), the United States Secret Service (USSS), and the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) seek to install durable and more aesthetic security elements in the President's Park South area and replace the existing temporary and unsightly security elements. The U.S. Secret Service will decide whether or not to make permanent the temporary pedestrian and vehicle closures in the area and whether the security elements meet security requirements. The National Park Service will decide on landscape and infrastructure changes to the area. NPS needs to ensure that the iconic historic nature of the landscape that is President's Park South is preserved and continues to be a welcoming destination for visitors.</p>
<p>A. Overarching Objective of the Competition<br />Replace existing security elements in the area, such as jersey barriers, provisional guard booths, canopy tents, bike racks, concrete planters, and standing canine vehicles. These security elements, while effective, are visually unattractive and detract from the iconic and historic nature of the area. The USSS seeks to install security elements that are both durable and more aesthetic at the vehicle checkpoints and along the street closures. The present temporary, unattractive, and visitor-unfriendly security and traffic management infrastructure within President's Park South should be transformed with a design concept that meets the following requirements: <br />1. Incorporates USSS security elements while improving the aesthetics and experience of visitors to President's Park South and the grounds of the White House. <br />2. Responds to security requirements and conforms to the area's historic status and features, its iconic nature, and its popularity as a visitor destination.<br />3. Integrates security requirements and the National Park Service cultural landscape preservation policies and guidelines.<br />4. Minimizes conflicts between official traffic entering and exiting the south side of the White House and visitors approaching or viewing the White House. <br />5. Creates an attractive environment that is not dominated by security apparatus for daily passersby and visitors approaching the southern fence of the White House. <br />6. Preserves and maintains the historic integrity of President's Park South including Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse, its side panels and roadways, State Place, E Street, Hamilton Place, and South Executive Avenue. <br /><br />B. Overall Site Boundaries<br />The design competition's overall study area is President's Park South which is part of the National Park System and includes Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse and its side panels, as well as the associated roadways in the area. The study area is President's Park South as bounded by State Place, Hamilton Place, and the South Fence of the White House grounds to the north, 15th Street to the east, Constitution Avenue to the south, and 17th Street to the west. The competition's focus is the environment along E Street between 15th and 17th Streets, NW and the environment along the perimeter of President's Park South, with the necessity of incorporating more durable security features for the White House and its grounds while preserving President's Park South's historic landscape and vistas.<br />A more detailed program describing the program elements, White House security objectives, and performance criteria for the redesign of E Street will be available to the finalists.</p>

Our members and the providers they choose will require patience and careful handling.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br>For<br>Water Control Structures Reconstruction, Hendry, Glades, Highlands, St Lucie, Palm Beach, and Martin County, Florida<br><br><br>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This announcement seeks information from industry, which will be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.<br><br>Scope of work is to replace 1930s era culverts and drainage structures which penetrate the Herbert Hoover Dike with water control structures meeting all current USACE engineering design criteria for dam safety projects.  The construction will breach an embankment Dam (Herbert Hoover Dike).  The reservoir (Lake Okeechobee) will be retained with a cofferdam.  The contractor will construct a water control structure through the embankment Dam, and reconstruct +/- 500 feet of earthen embankment Dam around each new water control structure.  Contractor will need experience and resources to manage heavy construction projects that include: large volumes of earthwork excavation and embankment Dam reconstruction; auger cast concrete steel reinforced piles; large scale steel sheet pile cofferdam constructed within the reservoir capable of supporting 26.5 feet of hydraulic head; grouting; portable concrete batch plants; cutoff walls 50 feet deep such as auger cast secant, jet grout, and/or soil cement bentonite; large scale concrete outlet structures; concrete gravity walls; and hydraulic steel structure fabrication such as welded steel water control gates and welded steel emergency bulkhead components classified as fracture critical structures.  The completed project is not a collection of individual components, but a system of interrelated components which must function together.  Contractor must be able to design and operate a dewatering system within the cofferdam to maintain a dry work area 10 to 18 feet below surface water of reservoir.  Contractor must be able to design and operate construction bypass pumping systems sized from 50 CFS to 200 CFS, and operate as required by user demands.  In order to minimize the duration that the embankment Dam is breached, the Contractor will need capability and resources to mobilize large amounts of equipment, materials, and personnel to remote locations to work on multiple sites concurrently.  Due to population centers around the embankment Dam, an uncontrolled breach carries loss of life consequences.  Construction may occur during hurricane season.<br><br>NOTE: Provide experiences based on the above. However, the experience does not have to be all inclusive. Projects may be awarded as one contract or several different projects.<br><br>Proposed project will be a competitive, Firm-fixed Price contract. The type of solicitation to be issued will depend upon the responses to this synopsis. The Government reserves the right to issue multiple types of contract under this market research. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.<br><br>The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of the Small Business Community: Small Business, Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUB-Zone), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsible contractors.<br><br>FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT TO INCLUDE<br><br>1. NAICS Code: 237990.<br>2. SB Size Standard: $33.5 million.<br>3. Bonding Requirements: The Government is looking for contractors with bonding capabilities in the following groupings: $5,000,000-$10,000,000; $10,000,000-$25,000,000; and $25,000,000 and up.<br>4. Geographical scope information: The culverts are located within Hendry, Glades, Highlands, St Lucie, Palm Beach and Martin County, FL.<br>5. Statement - Under FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, the prime contractor must perform at least 15% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees for general construction-type procurement.<br><br>Prior Government contract work is not required for submitting a response under this sources sought synopsis.<br><br>Firm's response to this Synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages and shall include the following information:<br><br>1. Firm's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address.<br>2. Firm's interest in bidding on the solicitation when it is issued.<br>3. Firm's capability to perform a contract of this magnitude and complexity.<br>4.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc., Ardsley, NY 10502.<br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <br><br>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <br> <br>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <br><br>This sole source document is for the purchase of one hundred (100) Motion Logger wrist actigraphy monitors, associated peripheral equipment necessary for data download and transfer, and software necessary for data analysis. The Motion Logger monitor produced by Ambulatory Monitoring Inc. has been specifically designed for use in sleep research where precision of measurement is paramount and compliance with the subject population is difficult. The complete Motion Logger system is composed of; the actigraphy monitors, the transfer cables necessary for downloading the monitors to a computer, and the ActME software which is the software responsible for interpreting the data downloaded for each subject. NHRC sees a need for 100 Motion Logger monitors so that large populations can non-invasively be monitored for sleep quality which is a marker of stress. The research plans of NHRC necessitate 100 Motion Logger monitors so that this research may take place as quickly and efficiently as possible.<br><br>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <br><br>The AMI Motion Logger has already been tested and validated in other miltary groups. The United States Army consulted on the design and function of this specific monitor to ensure a device active duty military would be more compliant with wearing. NHRC has had previous success using this monitor in the Special Warfare community versus other wrist devices that do not look nor function as well. The Motion Logger is manufactured and distributed by Ambulatory Monitoring Inc and therefore they are the only source available for purchasing this product. Further, AMI is capable of provide the large quantity of these devices to NHRC in the short time frame needed to complete this study. They have also agreed to provide any product modifications and updates to the technology as they are developed in the next year at no cost thus keeping NHRC current with emerging technologies.<br><br>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br><br>Market research was conducted and the Motionlogger monitor is the best wrist actigraphy system that; allows for extensive data logging, and functions as a standard sports watch. Therefore, due to options available the Motionlogger monitor is the only wrist actigraphy system that meets Navy requirements for the upcoming study on the benefits of TLD on markers of PTSD.<br><br>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<br><br>None<br><br>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <br><br>None<br><br>6.

<a href="mailto:jeanne.short@us.army.mil">Fort Bliss DOC</a>
<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command-Fort Bliss, intends to award on a sole-source basis to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, a contract for the acquisition of services for labor, supervision and required materials to train U.S. military in Counterinsurgency and Counter Improvised Explosive Device training in a hyper-realistic training environment.   In preparation for 3/1 AD's Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) Rotation and to properly certify these Companies/Troops, a realistic environment that accurately replicates the environment 3/1 AD will operate in for OEF is required.  3/1 AD requires facilities use for training such as an Afghan market, a mountain village, an adobe compound, two nomadic transient sites which are crucial to training, After Action Review (AAR) facilities, a white cell (exercise control) building, classroom area for training and conference room for the white cell.  The only place that will adequately prepare 3/1 AD in this training is the New Mexico Tech Playas Training and Research Center (PTRC); Fort Bliss currently does not have this capability yet.  The capabilities required are mock villages, role players, exercise control, AAR facilities, and biometric equipment.  This will provide 3/1 AD with a realistic site to simulate conditions that will be encountered during its OEF rotation.  Travel expenses are required for Subject Matter Experts and services for 190 role players, 160 of which will be fully immersed Afghan role players that will occupy the village sites.  These tasks listed above are considered FORSCOM core competencies and must be validated and certified by the brigade Commander upon completion of training.  <br>Services and specific range facilities such as realistic urban villages representative of the area of operations; market places and other urban features representative of current theaters of counterinsurgency operations; blue force command and control (C2) center and white cell exercise control C2 center; and air strip for small fixed wing aircraft and a maintenance hangar are provided by NM Institute.  If any organization (other than NM Institute) believes it is capable of providing an equivalent service at the high level of quality and complexity that is indispensable to the US Army, they shall email a Statement of Qualifications to the contract specialist, Jeanne Short at jeanne.short@us.army.mil no later than 3:00 PM EST on 24 March 2011.  <br>Further information concerning the training requirements are provided:  Capabilities must include 1) authorization to have the Army's Prophet equipment conduct signal intercepts on location; 2) direct reach back to Joint Forces Command to maneuver subject matter experts: 3) four mock Afghan training areas, and 4) availability to meet training schedule by providing training from 19 April through 13 May 2011.<br>The NM Institute will provide Reception, Staging, Onward-movement & Integration (RSOI) to role players and other training enablers; a secure closed system Ground System for Mobile communications (GSM) and/or higher power cellular network to support intelligence collection training objectives; storage space for container and barrier material provided by player units; training audience with exercise data collected and presentation material for AARs; and recovery of training area to the same condition as prior to the exercise.<br>The nature of the work involved requires all project personnel be eligible to hold a DoD security clearance at the Secret Level.  All contractor personnel assigned to work on-site in the United States Joint Force Command (USJFCOM) Suffolk and Norfolk, VA facilities and associated secure spaces, shall have, at a minimum, a Secret security clearance.  The NM Institute has the unique skills sets and capabilities that are essential for this COIN training and certification.<br>The Department of the Army is aware of no organization, other than the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology that can (a) provide the services described above; and (b) provide the broad range of expertise which NM Institute can make available on very short notice and which is covered within the cost of the package.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  Any responses received after 24 March 2011, 3:00 p.m. MST will not be considered by the Government.

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7930-01-490-7301<br />Name: Detergent, Laundry, with Bleach, Powered<br />Description: Biobased laundry detergent with bleach, powdered. Package contains two boxes that contain 214 oz. each. Each box washes 95 loads.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7930-01-490-7301<br />Similar Items: PAG42282 EA/CT</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 1, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide contractor support to develop and deliver a Professional Development Training Workshop (PDTW) for Arizona National Guard Service Members and their Families.  Further, the Arizona National Guard requires contract support to hold a symposium and planning meeting to develop a National Guard Combat and Operational Stress First Aid (COSFA) curriculum to be delivered at one PDTW for the Arizona National Guard Service Members and their Families.<br><br>1.2  Background.  Family Programs in conjunction with the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program are responsible for sponsoring, developing and presenting the COSFA model for Arizona National Guard Service Members and families.  The PDTW will be an ongoing event conducted in Phoenix, Arizona, beginning upon the approval of the contract and continuing when services are requested. The purpose of the PDTW is to prepare the above personnel personally and professionally to facilitate and provide crisis care and awareness for Arizona National Guard personnel and other authorized members of the Department of the Army. The COSFA development workshop will also ensure that Arizona National Guard Service Members are prepared to effectively deliver inclusive operational stress care and provide training to other Service Members to help identify Service Members and their Families who are at risk. <br><br>The Arizona National Guard has identified the need and will implement the developed model of Combat Stress First Aid (COSFA) to be used in the aftermath of crisis events, which differs from traditional models of immediate stress intervention.  The COSFA implementation will create a curriculum, which will be developed into a PDTW held in Phoenix, Arizona, at the Arizona National Guard Papago Park Military Reservation upon approval of the contract and for future dates upon request. There will also be a second three-day PDTW conducted in the future at a later date to be determined. The curriculum shall entail the following components: 1. Introduction to the framework of the COSFA model, 2. Skills based training on how to use the stress first aid model for individuals in crisis, 3. How to use the stress first aid model to respond to units in distress, and 4. How to guide commands on the use and utility of the COSFA model.<br><br>1.3  Scope.  The contractor shall develop and deliver a Professional Development Training Course (PDTC). This project will require development of a curriculum and relevant training support materials, curriculum validation and curriculum implementation. A select representative group determined by the Arizona National Guard will validate the curriculum upon approval of the contract, which will be held at the Arizona National Guard Papago Park Military Reservation in Phoenix, Arizona. <br><br>The contractor shall develop all logistical needs to create a three-day conference to implement COSFA as a crisis intervention into the Arizona National Guard.  The outcome of this conference will be the development and validation of a content and curriculum, as well as trained personnel within the National Guard who will be able to inform and educate other potential trainers and provide services to those Service Members and families needing crisis intervention. This PDTW will be delivered in Phoenix, Arizona.<br><br>1.4  Security Classification.

It will also address the derivative tasks of advisement to include participation in military operations and in the development of moral and ethical maturity of Service Members, families, and friends. <br><br>The development of the PDTW will provide training based upon recognizing when someone, more specifically Service Members, are in distress, breaking the code of silence that is present with the Service Member, and engaging the Service Member to connect to the next level of support needed.  The function of this model is to properly inform Arizona National Guard Service Members and their Families of the COSFA model, train them in individual and unit intervention strategies and work with and inform command of the functionality of the COSFA model as an evidence based model of care for personnel and units, which can act as a force multiplier.<br><br>Objectives:<br>At the conclusion of the COSFA training, 20 newly validated trainers will be able to:<br><br>(1)  Understand the COSFA model and the intent behind the "Be Resilient" Program.<br><br>(2)  Describe the function, scope and limitations of advisement in executing the command's mission, including the management of issues related to the impact of military operations and wartime missions.<br><br>(3)  Identify the derivative tasks of advisement.

<DESC>MEDCOM, Western Regional Contracting Office, Tacoma, WA intends to award a firm fixed priced order under FAR Part 6.302-1 for  the following Radiopharmaceutical Products:  Sodium Pertechnetate, DMSA medication , F18 FDG medication, and F18 NAF medication to Cardinal Health  in the amount of $126,631.20 for a one-time purchase. The stated procurement is a specific one-time buy and is not available for competition.  The required items are to be used by the Department of Radiology, Nuclear Medicine Services, located at William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, TX.  Because of limited shelf life of the radiopharmaceutical drug post preparations (usually less than 2 hours), Cardinal Health Nuclear is the only known company in the El Paso, TX area that can guarantee to deliver a quality product, on-time, upon receipt of an order from William Beaumont Army Medical Center.  The radioactive nature of the products means that they must be produced and delivered to the customer before decay.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement

<DESC>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The information provided may be used by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.
<p>United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is requesting industry comment on its ability to provide non-developmental, multi-functional devices with the maximum number of attributes as identified in Attachment 1 to this RFI. Those not able to provide all preferred features are still encouraged to submit information on the features currently available in their products and propose an applicable schedule, for those features that are not. This initiative is referred to as the USSOCOM Joint Tactical C4ISR Information Transceiver System (JTCITS).</p>
<p>USSOCOM is in the process of formally categorizing attributes into various levels and priority of requirements including Key Performance Parameters (KPP). Special Operations Forces (SOF) missions require teams and individuals to be capable of operating alone in austere, hostile environments. Each JTCITS transceiver shall provide as much capability as possible in the smallest and lightest form factor. In this regard, SOF equipment must be multifunctional in order to obtain and share situational and threat awareness information. This requires a technology readiness level (TRL) of no less than TRL 7.</p>
<p>The intent of the RFI is to identify those companies that possess the technical expertise, current production facilities, and integration and test capability to assemble, test, and produce systems in quantities of 50 or more per month. The JTCITS shall be assembled from Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and/or Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) hard/software and ready for shipment six months After Receipt of Order (ARO)</p>
<p>Once the information is received, USSOCOM may publish a synopsis requesting further information and industry comments on a refined set of requirements along with a draft acquisition strategy and milestone schedule.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall respond, within 30 days after release of this RFI, with existing or near-term mature capabilities or products that meet all or a subset of the aforementioned attributes. <br />All responses shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Deanna Cox, deanna.cox@socom.mil with a copy to the Program and technical point of contact, Mr. Mark Spadaro, spadarom@socom.mil.</p>
<p>This announcement is a request for information/comment only and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP). An RFP may be posted on Fed Biz Ops at some future time. However, the Government does not guarantee any action beyond this RFI.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />PART I I - WORK STATEMENT</p>
<p>A. Scope of Work<br />APHIS intends to award a firm, fixed-price, commercial supply contract limited to the USDA, APHIS, Pink Bollworm Rearing Facility in Phoenix, Arizona for the following item: 22,500 pounds of Agar Powdered USP, NF.</p>
<p>B. Period of Performance<br />10,000lbs due by June 1, 2011</p>
<p>12,500lbs due by June 15,2011</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />D. Performance Requirement<br />The PBWRF uses agar as a binding agent in the artificial insect diet prepared for rearing larvae of the pink bollworm. Contrary to most artificial insect diets containing agar, the pink bollworm diet is not left intact as poured, but is shredded into noodles approximately 5 mm wide and of varying thickness and length. Because of this special method of use, the agar acts more as a binding agent than it does a gelling agent as in other insect diets. As such, the requirements are more critical in terms of physical properties especially the strength of the gel (1.34% concentration) and the ability to retain moisture for a relatively long period of time. The agar supplied shall be the dried product of the water soluble extract of a species of Pterocladium, Gelidium or Gracilaria confervoides.</p>
<p>Excessive moisture loss from the diet results in two problems. If the loss comes from moisture-holding capability of the agar, the nutrients in the diet become too concentrated and if the loss comes from excessive syneresis, the resultant free moisture creates an unhealthy habitat for the larvae. In the case of the pink bollworm, the artificial diet not only provides the larvae with essential nutrients for their development, but also provides their living space. The agar shall not inhibit growth or reproduction of Pink Bollworm and must conform to the specifications listed above.</p>
<p>The product requested (Agar Powdered, USP, NF) shall meet the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>1. The diet product of the water-soluble extract of Pterocladium, Gelidium or of Gracilaria <br />confervoides. All material supplied under this contract shall be of the same type of seaweed and from the same geographical source.</p>
<p>2. Not contain more than 6.5% total ash, on a dry weight basis. <br /><br />3. Not contain more than 0.5% acid--insoluble ash, on a dry weight basis. <br /><br />4. The particle size shall be: More than 75% (by weight) shall pass through a #60 U.S. Standard <br />Sieve.</p>
<p>5. Must not cause a 6% reduction for a period of seven continuous days in the yield of <br />insects, size of insects, or reproductive potential (oviposition rate), nor affect the life cycle <br />by an increase of 24 hours or more as determined by USDA bioassay after award of contract, <br />i.e. no bioassay of the sample is done because of the length of time required.</p>
<p>6. Agar must have a gel strength of 1500 g pressure or more as determined with FMC agar gel <br />testing machine, measurement is made as follows:</p>
<p>a. Nine grams of agar are weighed and placed in a small flask.<br />b. Six hundred fifty (650) milliliters of water is preheated to 140 degrees F in a stainless steel beaker. The beaker is then placed on a hot plate/stirrer which has been on high for 30 minutes.<br />c. The stirrer bar is activated and the agar is slowly added in and mixed.<br />d. When the mixture reaches boiling, a timer is set for five (5) minutes and the agar is kept at a rolling boil for the 5 minute period. At the end of the 5 minutes, it is removed from the heat and allowed to sit for one (1) minute. It is then poured into 50mm x 70mm crystallizing dishes. The first dish is partially filled in' order to remove as much foam from the cooked agar as possible. Three (3) additional dishes are then filled as full as possible.<br />e. Samples are allowed to gel three (3) *hours at room temperature.<br />f. A full dish of agar is set in the center of the platform of the electronic scale. The power is turned on and the scale tared to 0. The LED light is illuminated in order to maintain peak reading after the gel ruptures. The small plunger (10.9mm) and the blue spring (0 1500 grams tension) is used at high speed (18cm/minute). The down button is lowered which starts the synchronous motor which lowers the plunger at a constant rate. Once the plunger contacts the gel the increasing force is registered on the scale display. The highest measured force is when the gel ruptures, this reading will be maintained on the display until the LED light is turned off and the break force reading is recorded.<br />g. All three (3) dishes are tested and the average break force reading is used for the final result.</p>
<p>7. The gel point shall be within 32 degrees to 45 degrees C. and the melting point shall be <br />within 85 degrees to 89 degrees C.<br />8. Must readily dissolve in boiling water within 5 minutes.<br />9. Microbial content shall not exceed 10,000 micro-organisms per gram and must be free of <br />other contaminants.<br />10. Agar must be packaged in the same type of container with respect to volume and shape, irrespective of the quantity. The agar must be packaged in a separate heavy polyethylene inner bag positioned in a fiberboard/cardboard drums. Each container shall be sound, clean, well sealed, and marked with product name, lot number, net weight;- contract number and name of Contractor.<br />Inspection<br />Inspection will take place within 3 working days from receipt of delivery, at the consignee's premises. Deliveries that are deemed not to be in compliance with the specifications are to be removed within 3 calendar days. Replacement agar shall be treated in accordance with FAR clause 52.212-4.</p>
<p><br />E. Testing and Approval of Product<br />Contractors wishing to submit an offer for this proposal need to submit a sample which needs to be shipped, separate from the actual proposal, to the PBWRF in, Phoenix, Arizona. Failure to submit a "Sample", or failure of the offerors' sample(s) to meet specifications, or submitting the actual offer (pricing) to the PBWRF in Phoenix, Arizona will render an offer non-responsive and ineligible for award. DO NOT INCLUDE PRICING (THE OFFER) WITH THE OFFEROR SAMPLE.<br />A one (1) pound sample of agar must be received at the following location by the date and time specified for receipt of offers: 04/07/2011 4pmCT<br />USDA, APHIS, Plant Protection and Quarantine<br />Pink Bollworm Rearing Facility<br />Attn: Ernie Miller<br />3645 E. Chipman<br />Phoenix, Arizona 85040</p>
<p>In the event the sample differs in any way from the agar to be supplied to the PBWRF, the offeror is to state how the sample differs. Contractor shall furnish for each sample supplied, the species of algae (binomial scientific name), geographical source, and time of year the seaweed was collected.<br />The sample will be evaluated within 14 days to determine compliance with the specifications. Agar must meet all parameters listed in technical critieria. If the sample fails the gel strength twice, further testing will be suspended. Products delivered under any resulting contract shall strictly' comply with the approved sample for gel strength and moisture retention. The agar shall not inhibit growth or reproduction of Pink Bollworm and must conform to the specifications listed above.<br />The contractor may not substitute a different type or form of Agar unless this is approved prior by the government.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13-101(b)(1) In the event one supplier is not able to supply the USDA, PPQ, PBWRF with the total amount of agar requested, in accordance with FAR 52.216-27, this request for quotes may result in multiple contract awards. The Government reserves the right to award to one offeror or make multiple award decisions based on the most advantageous offer to the Government. If the offeror cannot supply the full 22,500 pounds of agar they must indicate this in their offer as well as the amount they can provide.</p>
<p>In the event of multiple awards and the agar is purchased from more than one vendor, the vendor can provide the agar in one shipment or multiple shipments. If multiple shipments, the contractor can divide the agar into three equal parts and provide the agar according to the delivery dates above.</p>
<p>All the agar shipped, regardless of the number of shipments, must be packaged in the same type of container with respect to volume and shape, irrespective of the quantity. The agar must be packaged in a separate heavy polyethylene inner bag positioned in a fiberboard/cardboard drum. Each container shall be sound, clean, well sealed, and marked with product name, lot number, net weight, contract number, and name of Contractor.</p>

<DESC>Subject: Request for Proposals for Training and Distribution of the AUTONOMIE Software for Electric Vehicle Modeling
<p><br />Multiple companies have indicated a strong interest in being able to provide training and to become a distributor for the AUTONOMIE software. Argonne is in the R&amp;D business and will continue to develop additional capabilities in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and all electric vehicles (EVs). However, training and licensing activities have drained efforts from the R&amp;D activities, and Argonne would like to spinoff the training and software licensing activities to commercial organizations.</p>
<p>As a refresher, AUTONOMIE is a plug-and-play powertrain and vehicle model architecture and development environment to support the rapid evaluation of new powertrain/propulsion technologies for improving fuel economy, under dynamic/transient testing conditions, through virtual design and analysis in a math-based simulation environment. Because building hardware is expensive, traditional design paradigms in the automotive industry often delay control system design until late in the process - in some cases requiring several costly hardware iterations. Thus, greater emphasis be placed on modeling and simulation to reduce costs and improve time-to-market.</p>
<p>There appears to be a worldwide interest in modeling hybrid vehicles and Argonne has over 150 licensees and an estimated 800 users for AUTONOMIE, and interest in training and help-desk inquiries is rapidly increasing. Argonne sees as a good market opportunity for worldwide support of hybrid vehicles which will only increase as oil prices inch higher and higher, with automotive and truck manufacturing growing across the world. Argonne is seeking Licensees who have the ability and commitment to maximize the commercialization of AUTONOMIE worldwide.</p>
<p>A commercialization and licensing package must be completed. Argonne requires a commercialization plan from prospective licensees before licensing AUTONOMIE. Please completely answer all the questions on the form. The information you provide will be the basis for the license terms that Argonne will propose for the licensing agreement. This information is business confidential and will be held confidential by Argonne. Argonne will consider both existing and startup companies. After licensing, R&amp;D improvements in AUTONOMIE will continue to be made by Argonne and provided to the distributor(s). No decisions for Argonne to spinoff the R&amp;D of AUTONOMIE will be made for about 4-5 years. The Distributor will only provide only the executable code for distribution. Distributors are expected to keep the AUTONOMIE pricing the same, and not rise, for at least six months after an agreement is reached. Training pricing is expected to meet current commercial standards.</p>
<p>Argonne will hold a morning summary and question and answer session on this RFP on March 29, 2011 at Argonne. Please call the Argonne Technology Commercialization and Development (TDC) Division, Ms. Karen Neuman, at 630-252-9124 or 800-627-2596 to register for this session. The final proposals, addressing the above criteria, as well as the commercialization plan, must be submitted to the TDC on or before April 22, 2011. A winner will be selected and announced on May 23, 2011. The licensing agreements, and work-for- others agreements are expected by July 8, 2011.Please contact me , Paul Betten, at tel: (630) 252-4962,f you have any questions or wish to sign up for the AUTONOMIE RFP conference on March 29, 2011. Please contact me if you cannot download the commercialization worksheet.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>DESCRIPTION: In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2), the Army, using a two-step Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, is soliciting abstracts to conduct concept exploration of a 6.2 Research & Development effort called Rotorcraft Durability and Damage Tolerance (RDDT). The first step in the two-step process consists of receipt and review of abstracts summarizing the project that is to be the subject of a proposal. The purpose of abstract review is to foster competition, provide feedback to prospective proposers relative to the likelihood of being funded so that better decisions can be made regarding incurring cost for proposal submission. Abstract feedback will be provided to facilitate an Offeror's decision on whether to prepare a full proposal. Our response to an abstract is advisory only. The abstract should provide enough information to permit review against the evaluation criteria. Feedback will consist of a qualitative assessment and recommendation relative to full proposal submission. The second step in the two-step process consists of receipt and evaluation of proposals from which award decisions will be made. Offerors who do not submit an abstract are permitted to submit a full proposal. Every proposal will be subjected to the same comprehensive evaluation. Submission of a full proposal is necessary in order to receive an award under this announcement. The two step approach benefits Offerors by allowing them to disband proposal teams (if desired) after the abstract phase. It benefits the Government by alleviating time wasted associated with evaluating proposals which are not of sufficient technical interest/quality. <br><br>A.	INTRODUCTION<br><br>Current Army rotorcraft require continual inspection and maintenance for environmental damage and battle damage which limits aircraft availability.  Army rotorcraft systems require improved range, payload, durability, and survivability for high operating tempo.  <br><br>To address these problems, investments in rotary-wing Applied Research will be directed to develop and mature Durability and Damage Tolerance (D&DT), which address the following Structures Technology Objectives: Reduced Structural Maintenance Labor, Increased Structural Efficiency, and Increased Accuracy of Stress and Internal Load Prediction.  <br><br>This BAA is limited to 6.2 Applied Research and is used to solicit effort needed to advance the technology readiness levels (TRLs) of rotary-wing compatible technologies sufficiently for follow-on 6.3 Advanced Technology Demonstration or commercialization.  Efforts under this BAA are expected to develop and mature promising technologies to a TRL-5 (Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment).  The Combat Tempered Platform Demonstration, Autonomous Sustainment Technologies for Rotorcraft Operations, and the Joint Multi-Role Technology-enabled Capability Demonstration, along with fleet modifications, upgrades and life extensions are likely transition opportunities for sufficiently mature technologies.<br><br>B.	REQUIREMENTS<br><br>1.	Technical Description:  The AATD seeks proposals to advance technologies in rotorcraft durability and damage tolerance analysis, design, qualification and life management.  Efforts focusing on rotorcraft structural integrity technologies such as: probabilistic failure initiation and progression analysis methods to estimate remaining life; improved analysis techniques for metallic and composite rotating and non-rotating structure; mission based probabilistic life predictions to allow for probability of success predictions based on vehicle current start and anticipated mission; and improved load and usage spectrum development techniques.  Also sought are proposals in damage tolerance based design, qualification and life management technologies; durability structural concepts including repair techniques; and high-strain capable structural concepts through advanced design, analysis and/or material solutions.   Significant work has already been done to develop the Integrated Rotorcraft Damage Tolerance (IRDT) methodology; however, additional maturation of the underlying technologies that support this methodology is necessary, as well as proposed D&DT techniques, concepts, validation strategies, and potential improvements in weight and operational availability will be considered in evaluating the concepts  <br><br>2.	Deliverable Items:  All awards will require delivery of the following data items or deliverables: (1) Management Plan (2) Bi-Monthly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports (3) Final Report (4) Meeting Minutes (5) Briefing Charts and may require (6) Special Technical Reports as required. <br><br>3.	Security Requirements: This effort will likely generate technical data that is subject to export control laws and regulations.  Only those offerors registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this Broad Agency Announcement. Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification process. Offerors must submit a copy of the offeror's approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with its proposal.  Those offerors considered to be under foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) must have a Defense Security Service (DSS) approved Special Security Agreement (SSA) or other approved mitigation plan prior to submission of offers, see National Industrial Security Procedures Operating Manual (NISPOM), Department of Defense (DoD) Manual 5220.22-M, Chapter 2, Section 3. The Government does not anticipate the generation of classified data as part of this effort.<br><br>4.	Other Special Requirements - Data Rights:  At a minimum, the Government desires "Government Purpose Rights" as defined by the DFARS, to all technical data, deliverables, and computer software to be delivered, and no limitations on the use of delivered and/or residual hardware.   It is the Offeror's responsibility to clearly define the proposed data rights. <br><br>C.	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (TOPIC)<br><br>1.	Anticipated Period of Performance:  Not to exceed 24 months total (21 technical and 3 for Data / Final Report); however focused 15-21 months total efforts are desired.  <br><br>2.	Government Estimate: Available funding for D&DT is approximately $2.944 M distributed by fiscal year as follows:  FY11 $1.00M; FY12 1.014 M; FY13 0.93M.  To adequately invest in each technology area and maximize the breadth of technology developed, it is the Government's intent to make multiple awards.  <br><br>3.	Government Furnished Property and Data: It is the Offeror's responsibility to identify, coordinate, and furnish supporting documentation for use of any Government furnished equipment or property.  No government furnished data will be provided. Offerors must have access to or be capable of generating the data required to develop and validate the technologies proposed.<br><br>4.	Reference Documents:  Two documents/reports outlining previous efforts in this area are available from the: SARAP TM&TS Final Report, Qualification Final Report (RDECOM TR 06-D-11) available from the Defense Technical Information Center (http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/) (Accession Number: ADB316836); and An Integrated Rotorcraft Damage Tolerance Methodology for Design, Analysis, and Qualification of Fatigue Critical Metal Airframe Structure (66th Annual Forum of the American Helicopter Society, Phoenix, AZ, May 2010. (http://www.vtol.org/ )<br><br>D.	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (GENERAL)<br><br>1.	Type of Funding Instrument:  A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy.  Such instruments include conventional Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented.  Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) is also an acceptable funding instrument.  Parties proposing TIAs must provide at least half of the costs of the project to the maximum extent practicable.  This is a statutory condition for those TIAs under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and is a matter of DoD policy for all other TIAs.  The purpose of the cost share is to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321006r34p.pdf.  The type of funding instrument is a subject for negotiation, but the offeror's desire shall be clearly stated in the cost proposal. <br><br>2.	Size Status: Due to the complexity and technical considerations, this solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.   <br><br>3.	Partial Award:  The Government reserves the right to fund all, some, or none of the proposals submitted.  The Government may elect to fund only part of any or all proposals; and may incrementally fund any or all awards under this effort.  All awards are subject to the availability of funds.<br><br>E.	PREPARATION & SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>1.	A two step BAA process will be used.  A synopsis will be issued that requests interested parties to submit abstracts.  The abstracts will be reviewed and invitations to submit full proposals will be sent to Offerors meeting the BAA topic and who are deemed sufficiently meritorious to have a reasonable opportunity for award.  Offerors whose abstracts were not selected for full proposal submission will still be given the opportunity to submit a full proposal.  Offerers who submit a proposal but did do not submit an abstract will not be considered for an award.  Each abstract and proposal shall be evaluated against the evaluated criteria.  All criteria for the abstract and proposal will be weighted equally to determine the best value to the Government.  This Broad Agency Announcement constitutes the total solicitation. There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may revise proposal or abstract due dates. This announcement is open and valid through July 1, 2011, unless sooner cancelled.  We anticipate making multiple awards in FY 2011, depending on funding availability. Abstracts and proposals can be submitted any time during the open period of this announcement but will be processed based upon date of receipt and proposal validity period. Anticipated contract awards date is September 2011. To be considered for award, the abstract cut-off date is not later than 1:00 p.m. local time, April 20, 2011 and the proposal cut-off date is not later than 1:00 p.m. local time, July 1, 2011. Any proposal received after the final cut-off date of  July 1, 2011, will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors Competitive Acquisition.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation #W91LV2SRTSMED is hereby issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for lodging during the period of 29 April 2011-01 May 2011 in the San Antonio, TX area. This procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. Only small businesses under NAICS Code 721110 are being solicited resulting in a COMPETITIVELY awarded purchase order contract. The small business size standard for NAICS code 721110 is $30,000,000 or less. Note: The small business size standard for Hotels has recently been increased from $7.5M to $30M. All vendors are requested to update their CCR records to reflect any changes that may be necessary to reflect their current size standard. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to provide contracted services as set forth below and in the attachments. The anticipated award will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP)-type contract. Vendors must submit quotes on the full quantity identified. Award shall be made to a single vendor. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to make no award under this procedure. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. QUOTES MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION. FAILURE TO SUBMIT ANY OF THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WILL RESULT IN A REJECTED BID DUE TO NON-RESPONSIVENESS: a) a list of three (3) references for a similar stay. References shall include; name/point of contact, address, phone number, and Email address b) a list of facility amenities c) pricing, CAGE code, DUNS number, and Federal Tax ID d) a statement confirming that your company is registered in ORCA or a copy of your company`s Representations and Certifications completely filled out e) For third party vendors, your quote shall include the additional information requested in the paragraph listed below. Failure to provide this information with your quote may deem your quote to be technically unacceptable and/or non-responsive. This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offerors services as a prime contractor and forward a copy of a signed, written agreement between the offeror and a representative who has binding authority of stated hotel facility. This agreement must state that it covers the period of performance requested in the solicitation and be signed by both parties. In addition, a copy of all insurance(s) (standard business, liability, extraordinary insurances) must be submitted with the offerors technical proposal for evaluation purposes. The technical approach must provide the name, phone number, and email address of a lodging representative from the offerors company (not a representative of the proposed hotel) will be available full-time during the event(s) and must be physically present full time at the hotel during the entire event(s). Again, this is NOT a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party vendor shall be deemed technically unacceptable. The requirements and Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) for this request for quote are listed in the attachment entitled REQUEST FOR QUOTE. Contractors are to complete the RFQ and return by the submittal date & time listed within same. Please note that the Government is not authorized to pay prices higher than the allowable per diem rate for a specific area. The maximum allowable rate for Bexar County, Texas is $106.00 per night. ONLY ONE QUOTE PER CONTRACTOR WILL BE CONSIDERED. ANY QUOTES NOT RECEIVED BY THE DUE DATE AND TIME SPECIFIED IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE REJECTED. ADDITIONALLY, ANY INCOMPLETE PROPOSALS NOT CONTAINING THE REQUIRED INFORMATION AS STATED IN THIS SOLICITATION/SYNOPSIS WILL ALSO BE REJECTED. NOTE: The final quoted price(s), both total and individual, MUST include all applicable taxes, fees, gratuities, commissions, service charges, etc...NO EXCEPTIONS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TAX EXEMPT. PROVISIONS/CLAUSES: please see provisions and clauses section below that will/may apply to this solicitation and/or purchase order contract. LOCATION: The hotel must be within the city limits of San Antonio, Texas. The contractor is put on notice that the Government will not be held liable for any requirement that is to be paid for by participants or any amounts associated with those items, including any guaranteed minimum purchases that the contractor may require.

<p>c. If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, Kim Diercks<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-2379<br />email: Kim.Diercks@usafa.af.mil</p>
<p>Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>d. The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency</p>
<p>e. Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer<br />(End of clause)</p>
</p>
<p><br />5352.242-9000 Contractor Access to Air Force Installations (Jun 2010): <br /><br />a. The contractor shall obtain base identification and vehicle passes, if required, for all contractor personnel who make frequent visits to or perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation.<br /><br />b. The contractor shall submit a written request on company letterhead to the contracting officer listing the following: contract number, location of work site, start and stop dates, and names of employees and subcontractor employees needing access to the base. The letter will also specify the individual(s) authorized to sign for a request for base identification credentials or vehicle passes. The contracting officer will endorse the request and forward it to the issuing base pass and registration office or security police for processing. When reporting to the registration office, the authorized contractor individual(s) should provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, valid vehicle insurance certificate, and (refer to USAFA A-01 Contractor Access to USAFA Instruction) to obtain a vehicle pass.<br /><br />c. During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site. <br /><br />d. When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with [insert any additional requirements to comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management,] citing the appropriate paragraphs as applicable.<br /><br />e. Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office. <br /><br />f. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of IV Fluids. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br />The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<br />This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be conducted concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is July 2011. The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Point of Contact: Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270, Mr. Jim Quinn, Clinical Analyst, james.e.quinn@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3295.</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of IV Fluids. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $4,690,986.41. This forecast is based on historical Prime Vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, twenty-four (24) line items of the total one hundred forty-six (146) line items, account for 82.06% ($3,849,423.96) of the total volume in sales ($4,690,986.41) in the MMESOs, and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 24 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270 Mr. Jim Quinn, Clinical Analyst, james.e.quinn@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3295.</strong> The vendor's initial response will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that their initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO South via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor that does not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFIAQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO South reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendor and determine whether vendor meets the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. Vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical requirements outlined below. The five (5) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement:<br />1. Vendor MUST provide a line of IV Fluids products that includes at a minimum the specific products and sizes identified below for IV Fluids and Admixture Solutions from the following categories; All products must be Latex Free. Sodium Chloride 0.9%, and Lactated Ringers. Vendor is required to supply all items listed in all sizes listed and will include at a minimum: <br />Item Description<br />SOLUTION IV SODIUM CHLORIDE 0.9% 1000ML<br />SOLUTION IV LACTATED RINGERS 1000ML<br />SOLUTION IV SODIUM CHLORIDE 0.9% 500ML<br />SOLUTION IV SODIUM CHLORIDE 0.9% 250ML<br />SOLUTION IV SODIUM CHLORIDE 0.9% 100ML<br />SOLUTION IV SODIUM CHLORIDE 0.9% 50ML</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFIAQ with initial submittal. Vendor is required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device types. (Vendor who does not have a complete product line as stated above will be disqualified in Phase I).<br />b. Operational usage items are included in this list of IV Fluids. <br />2. Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the IV Fluids product line. Vendor MUST provide the DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal. Vendor without a DAPA number or who has not applied for a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />3. Vendor MUST have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for IV Fluids or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal. Vendor whose products are not available through the Prime Vendors or who has not applied for PV distribution will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />4. Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for the products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendor that fails to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in Phase III for ALL products will be disqualified.).<br />5. Vendor MUST provide IV Fluids products that are approved for use by the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA). The IV Fluids products shall comply with the National Patient Safety Goals (NPSG), Universal Protocol (UP), and the Center for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration (OSHA) Standards, and provide literature to support this requirement with the initial submittals. Vendor who does not meet the above requirements or who fails to provide documentation to support these requirements will be disqualified in Phase I. <br /><br />Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Requirements <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO South, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process. Vendor must send the MMESO South verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, and tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned). One case (1cs) or 12 bags each of IV Fluids samples listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites that will be identified in the letters of invitation.<br />Item to Send Number Each to send per MTF Size Item Description<br />Solution IV Sodium Chloride 0.9% 1 case or 12 bags each 1000cc Solution IV Sodium Chloride 0.9% 1000ml&nbsp;<br />The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation will be conducted using the below listed requirements with responses as either a "YES" (meets/passes requirements) or "NO" (does not/fails to meet requirements) answers. The MMESO TPRB has established that the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization will be eighty percent (80%) of the requirements questions answered as "YES" (meets/passes requirements). Vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Vendor that has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO South, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review. Each MTF will evaluate the IV Fluids products with the below listed requirements. Each requirement for IV Fluids will be evaluated by two (2) trials (each clinical trial site will have at least two (2) clinical evaluators who will each evaluate all samples one time) in a non-clinical/non-patient setting.</p>
<p>There will be approximately eight (8) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below:<br />1. Container labeling is easy to read and includes type of fluid, volume gradient and expiration date. <br />2. The fluid container is optically clear, making it easy to determine the condition of the fluid. <br />3. The solution is easily accessible via container access port.<br />4. After container is spiked, the tubing remains secure with no leaking.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis <br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to the MMESO South and must be received by 5:00 PM CST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</p>

<p>52.211-9 Desired and Required Time of Delivery. <br />Desired and Required Time of Delivery (June 1997)</p>
<p>(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:</p>
<p>DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE <br />[Contracting Officer insert specific details] <br />ITEM NO. QUANTITY ON OR BEFORE <br />1 850 boxes 09-08-2011<br />2 400 boxes 09-08-2011<br />3 2 boxes 09-08-2011</p>
<p>If the Offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government's required delivery schedule as follows:</p>
<p>REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE <br />[Contracting Officer insert specific details] <br />ITEM NO. QUANTITY ON OR BEFORE<br />1 850 boxes 09-15-2011<br />2 400 boxes 09-15-2011<br />3 2 boxes 09-15-2011</p>
<p>Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.</p>
<p>OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE <br />[Contracting Officer insert specific details] <br />ITEM NO. QUANTITY ON OR BEFORE<br />1 850 boxes <br />2 400 boxes <br />3 2 boxes</p>
<p><br />(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. <br />(End of clause) <br />Alternate I (Apr 1984). If the delivery schedule is expressed in terms of specific calendar dates or specific periods and is based on an assumed date of award, the contracting officer may substitute the following paragraph (b) for paragraph (b) of the basic clause. The time may be expressed by substituting "on or before"; "during the months _______"; or "not sooner than ______, or later than ______" as headings for the third column of paragraph (a) of the basic clause.</p>
<p>(b) The delivery dates or specific periods above are based on the assumption that the Government will make award by _________ [Contracting Officer insert date]. Each delivery date in the delivery schedule above will be extended by the number of calendar days after the above date that the contract is in fact awarded. Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails.</p>

For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the Contractor is considered to be an employee of the agency. <br />(c)(1) "Operation of a system of records," as used in this clause, means performance of any of the activities associated with maintaining the system of records, including the collection, use, and dissemination of records.</p>
<p>(2) "Record," as used in this clause, means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains the person's name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a fingerprint or voiceprint or a photograph. <br />(3) "System of records on individuals," as used in this clause, means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.</p>

SHIP TO ADDRESS:
FRC WEST
Bldg.180 Reeves  Blvd.
FL1 Room: 101
NAS Lemoore, CA  93246-5023

STATEMENT OF WORK:
This is Statement of Work (SOW) identifies necessary services and materials to provide personnel assigned to Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRCSW) at the Lemoore remote facilities, with the lease and cleaning of garments and working apparel, which are commensurate with industry standards.
  The contractor must provide commercial garments that people typically use in the aviation repair and support industry and provide all necessary cleaning, laundering, garment repair services and delivery and pick up processes to comply with the Governments requirements set forth in this SOW. 
The contractor shall provide services Monday through Friday (excluding federal holidays), between the hours of 06:00 A.M. and 1:00 P.M., local time.  These services include pick-up, cleaning, packaging, and delivery of a variety of articles of clothing. Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRCSW) personnel may expose these articles of clothing to petroleum based lubricant and preservation oils, grease, JP4/5 aircraft fuel, adhesives, and alcohol.
  Upon request, the government will furnish a current copy of the applicable material safety data sheet (MSDS), for purposes of promoting employee safety, as relates to the performance of this contract.
The contractor shall monitor service to ensure that delivery quantities meet the pre-determined levels.  If the contractor cannot sustain the quotas, regardless of cause, the contractor shall immediately notify the COTR, Gene L. Peters, at FRCSW, Bldg. 90-2, Code 6.3.1, NAS North Island, San Diego, CA.  92135-7058; PH: 619-545-9753; e-mail: gene.peters@navy.mil. Then, the contractor will assist the COTR in determining what measures are necessary to reestablish inventory levels.  The COTR is the only government representative, in addition to the Contracting Officer, authorized to place service calls to the contractor.
The contractor shall periodically replace all garments provided through this service.
  Although variables may influence this process, the normal life expectancy associated with similar industrial applications is from 5-8 months.  All garments shall be marked in a conspicuous manner to reflect their initial service date, and replaced no later than one year after the initial service.  All costs for marking these leased items, and their replacement, will be the expense of the contractor.
The estimated requirements shown on the Pricing Pages will vary with the demands of the FRCSW end users. These quantities are for information purposes only and do not guarantee a minimum amount if FRCSW requirements lessen or restrict the maximum amount to be delivered throughout the contract period if FRCSW requirements increase.
 No variations from the estimated quantities, regardless of extent, entitle the Contractor to an adjustment in the unit price or to any other compensation.
FRCSW based the quantities on five changes per wearer per week. We request each bidder to base his or her unit weekly rental rate on five changes per wearer per week, unless FRCSW specifies another assumption. The contractor shall not base their weekly rate on the whole inventory of 11 or more units required to provide five changes. For example, if the vendor acquires 11 uniforms to provide five changes per week, the vendor shall bill only for the five changes, not for the 11 uniforms.
The contractor shall provide Semi-Annual (02 EA) On-Site Physical Inventories, for the Period-of-Performance (POP) associated with the order.
  The contractor shall provide a closeout, on site physical inventory, at the conclusion of the agreement. The contractor shall coordinate the schedule of the physical inventories with the COTR.  Additionally, the contractor will provide a detailed service report to the government, wherein the results of the findings are made available, within Seven (7 EA) Days after performing the inventory.  The report shall identify, in detail, all information related to lease/cleaning, loss/ruined articles, and/or issues affecting the ability of the contractor to meet service requirements.  The contractor will transmit this information by either e-mail or expedited currier service to the Governments COTR.
There shall be no additional service charges, other than those specified herein, regardless of when the contractor provided the services and/or deliverables.
 The time spent by service/maintenance personnel after arrival at the site (or lodging while awaiting the arrival of additional personnel, equipment, or the delivery of materials and/or parts), or during transportation to or from other sites, or for overtime work, or for work performed outside of normal business, is not allowed. 
Note:  The contractor shall perform all pick-ups and deliveries on Tuesdays.  Scheduled pick-ups or deliveries that fall on federal holidays will be on the next regularly scheduled workday of the Government. The contractor shall deliver all laundered items in A condition, meaning the contractor shall replace any missing buttons or broken zippers, and shall repair ripped fabric and loose hems.
 The contractor shall provide individual shirts and pants on individual hangers, except specific line items that require lint free, individual packaging or static free packaging.  All garments must be preshrunk.
Security
Upon award, the Contractor shall submit to the Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRCSW), Security Department, Code 6.5.2, a letter requesting site clearance for all maintenance personnel.  The letter shall include the name(s), date(s) of birth, place(s) of birth, last four of social security number, vehicle license number(s), contract number, and contract commencement and end date.  The letter shall be required within Five (5 EA) Days following receipt of this order, by the Contractor.
  Additionally, the Contractor shall send a copy of the clearance request to the Government Designated Government Representative, Gene L. Peters, at FRCSW, Bldg. 90-2, Code 6.3.1, NAS North Island, San Diego, CA.  92135-7058; e-mail: gene.peters@navy.mil.

Billing will be on WEEKLY basis in arrears. 

Note: although the contractor provides eleven units to supply 10 changes every two weeks, the contractor will bill the government only for the five changes per week. Not for six which would include the item on the back of the person when they turn in and receive the five garments per week.

The flange/couplings identified in the Description of Items or Services will be furnished to the contractor at the prices established at award for overhaul. The information contained in the scope of work is not intended to be all inclusive or to detract from procedures outlined in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specification except where noted herein. All repair actions shall be in accordance with the OEM commercial repair manuals and Federal Aviation Regulation Parts 43 and 145 or alternate standard approved in writing by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Medium Response Recovery (MRR) Engineering Branch. Components furnished hereunder shall be returned by the contractor in an airworthy condition and in all respects suitable for installation in USCG aircraft.

<p>3.

<p><br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202 <br />Washington, D.

     (3) The clause at 52.212-5.

     (7) The Standard Form 1449.
 
     (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments

   (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
 
     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

GRAND TOTAL:________________

1.	Contractor shall provide pastoral care to all new patients admitted within the previous 24 hours.
2.	Contractor shall be responsible to visit all patients of all Protestant denominations as well as those who fall in the categories of Buddhism, Muslim, Native American and those claiming No Preference.  This assures that all patients regardless of sect or creed receive at least one visit from a VA Chaplain during their admission.
3.	Contractor shall at times work on a Sunday at which time he/she would provide a General Protestant Worship Service for patients at the regularly scheduled time at their respective duty station.
4.	As a Contract Chaplain, Contractor may need to work a 4-hour shift two days a week or more as needed, when the fulltime Protestant Chaplain is on Days Off.  
5.	Contractor shall also be available to cover for the fulltime Protestant Chaplain when he/she is on Annual Leave or other types of leave.
6.	Should Contractor receive an emergency call-back outside of normal duty hours he/she will be compensated two hours pay at the negotiated rate.
7.	At no time shall the Contractor proselytize to a patient or attempt to persuade or coerce a patient to lean toward a particular belief.

Contractor shall dedicate a set amount of time to offer pastoral care to end-of-life patients and their families.
The C&A requirements do not apply and a Security Accreditation is not required.

Privacy and security sections - pertinent to Chaplain Services
VA HANDBOOK 6500.6
APPENDIX C

1.	GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
2.	ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
a.	A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
b.	All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
c.	Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
d.	Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
e.	The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
a.	Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
b.	VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
c.	Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.
d.	The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.
e.	The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality,
privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold
payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.
g.	If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.
h.	The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.
i.	The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.
j.	Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.
k.	Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
l.	For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

4. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
a.	The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
b.	To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's
notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident
(including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or
compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
c.	With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
d.	In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident21The provision 52.212-1 (INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)), does apply to this acquisition and there is no addenda to the provision.

Privacy and security sections - pertinent to Chaplain Services
VA HANDBOOK 6500.6
APPENDIX C

1.	GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
2.	ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
a.	A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
b.	All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
c.	Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
d.	Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
e.	The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
a.	Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
b.	VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
c.	Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.
d.	The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.
e.	The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality,
privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold
payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.
g.	If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.
h.	The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.
i.	The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.
j.	Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.
k.	Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
l.	For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

4. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
a.	The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
b.	To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's
notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident
(including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or
compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
c.	With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
d.	In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

<p>&nbsp;Subject:&nbsp; Revisions to the solicitation and due dates</p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition to recent questions and answers, the LOC is planning to amend the FEBIZOPS solicitation to reflect the following change in due dates and procurement schedule;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; 3/24/11 - Pre-bid Conference in LM623 at 10am</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; 3/25/11 - Questions Due</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; 3/31/11 - Revised Bids Due Date</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; 4/18/11 - Pre Award Conference in LM623 at 10am</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; 4/30/11 - Award Date</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; 5/1/11 - &nbsp;New Contract Start Date</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The Library of Congress is offering a pre-bid meeting for ALL interested offerors to answer related questions pursuant to this solicitation.&nbsp; We will need to know the number of persons that will be attending by 2pm on Wednesday March 23rd via e-mail to <a href="mailto:iher@loc.gov">iher@loc.gov</a> or <a href="mailto:eeld@loc.gov">eeld@loc.gov</a></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Eric Eldrige or Ida Hernandez will meet ALL interested offerors that respond to this notice by 03/23/2010 2:00pm, in the LOC Madison Facility Lobby at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday 24, 2011.&nbsp; The address is as follows:<br /></span><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><br />Madison</span></strong><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"> Memorial Building</span></strong><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">, <br />Library of Congress <br /></span></strong><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Room LM 624<br />101 Independence Ave., S.E., <br />Washington, DC 20540</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The following are questions and clarifications asked by ALL interested parties as of 03/17/2011:</strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Page 3 of the solicitation, at the top, it states that LOC is requesting a $75,000 contract. Based on the number of hours requested in the RFQ and the market rate for certified interpreters, this number seems far below current government market rates. &nbsp;Will the Government consider offers that are more than this amount?</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Answer:&nbsp;Disregard.&nbsp; This was an old government estimate that will be remove in the revised solicitation.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section A.2.2.2 states questions are due no later than March 21, 2011, &nbsp;while Section A.2.2.4 states that they are due after the pre-proposal conference and site visit, five calendar days before the due date for submission of proposals. &nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Government clarify when is the last date that questions can be submitted in case we have further questions?</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Answer:&nbsp;See the above notice.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section A.2.2.4 mentions a pre-proposal conference and site visit. We are very interested in attending such a conference and feel it would be highly beneficial to our understanding of the requirements. Can the Government inform us of when and where such a meeting will take place?</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Answer:&nbsp;See the above notice.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">4a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLIN 001c (and related CLINs for option years) seems to have been drawn from the title of a section and does not specify what the offeror would be pricing. If there is a service that we should price under this CLIN, can the Government specify the exact service so that we may price accordingly.<span style="COLOR: #1f497d"> </span><strong><span style="COLOR: #548dd4">&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Answer:&nbsp; Any other communication access services not already listed.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;4b<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">.&nbsp; CLIN 001a requests sign language interpreting services in the amount of 1500 hours per year.&nbsp; CLIN 002 is for additional personnel to provide communication access services (sign language interpreting, CART, CAN, VRI, etc) during normal work hours in the amount of 100 hours per year.&nbsp; What additional services is CLIN 001c asking for during the regular work hours as designated by CLIN 001 since sign language, VRI, CART, and CAN are already covered by separate CLIN designators?</span></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Answer:&nbsp; Interpreting services across a range (ASL; Contact Signing; Close Vision; Tactile; Oral; Cued Speech; Certified Deaf Interpreter; Reader for the Blind). The most common type of request is for ASL and Contact Signing.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLIN 003b (and related CLINs for option years) states "Emergency or additional personnel..." Can the Government clarify the meaning of the word "emergency"? Is it simply referring to a last minute, unexpected need (ad hoc), or is it in reference to something related to disaster/crisis?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Answer:&nbsp;The wording "emergency or additional personnel" related to last minute interpreting services. The Library of Congress has medical staff on site and from time to time do request interpreting services for routine and emergent consultations. &nbsp;Actual emergency medical needs are referred to local outside medical services.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Scope of Work, under Interpreter Qualifications, the solicitation states that the interpreters must be competent in the "Code of Ethics of the National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf". The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) is a national organization, however the word National is not a part of the title of the organization. Also, the Code of Ethics was revised and interpreters now adhere to the Code of Professional Conduct. &nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Government accept a constructive change in the proposals to reflect the correct names?&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Answer:&nbsp; Yes</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the SOW, page 11, the terms "Core Hours" and "On-Call Hours" are used. It is an industry standard that "On-Call" refers to the interpreters who are regularly scheduled to be on-site and be available to provide services to all the Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing employees and/or visitors during predetermined hours. It appears that the item labeled "Core Hours" is actually referring to regularly scheduled on-call services. Can the Government clarify if this is the intended meaning? If so, is the section labeled "On-Call" actually referring to additional service requests beyond the on-call schedule? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Answer:&nbsp; The wording Core Hours refers to onsite interpreting services Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. The wording "On-Call" refers to supplemental interpreting services beyond the services provided by the onsite interpreter during core hours.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The requirement for Past Performance information that was added to the solicitation via the modification does not state in which volume this information should be included. Can the Government please clarify if this information should be included in the Contract Data Price Proposal or the Technical Proposal?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Answer:&nbsp;Include this in Volume II, Technical Proposal</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are resumes counted against the page count for the technical proposal?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Answer:&nbsp;YES</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">10.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Section L under the instructions for Volume I, it states that offerors are required to complete the LOC Vendor Information Request form attached to the solicitation. We did not find this form attached. Can the government please provide this form.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Answer:&nbsp;Will attach it in the revised solicitation. (SEE ATTACHMENT)</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">11.&nbsp;&nbsp; The NIACS Code listed for this solicitation is 561320. Most solicitations for sign language interpreting services are listed under NIACS Code 541930, Translation and Interpretation Services. What is the correct NIACS code for this solicitation?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Answer:&nbsp;Use NIACS Code 541930</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">12.&nbsp;&nbsp; How many consumers (Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing) are served by the contract?&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Answer:&nbsp; 17 full time Deaf employees (professional and technical positions, currently no managerial positions). An average of 7 Deaf high school and college interns working or volunteering part time intermittently throughout the year. Plus public.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">13.&nbsp; The solicitation, in section B.3.1 Services and Pricing &amp; C.1 Statement of Work - Assistive Technologies, requests capabilities and pricing for Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) services.&nbsp; Do LOC employees currently utilize VRI services as part of their daily work?&nbsp; If so, what platform/equipment are they currently utilizing?</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto"><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000">Answer:&nbsp; No. We are building in the capability. &nbsp;All Deaf employees currently have Sorenson videophones.</span></strong><br /><br />14.&nbsp; VRI services require broadband network access in order for equipment to communicate with each other.&nbsp; Will the VRI equipment be hooked to an existing network within the LOC or will VRI services run on a separate network?</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto"><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000">Answer:&nbsp; The current videophones are on their own internal network maintained by the Library.</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto">15.&nbsp; Are the VRI services intended to only connect to the Core Hours interpreter, meaning the interpreter occupying an LOC furnished office space on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, or are they intended to act as an emergency measure to provide services and connect to an interpreter located outside of the LOC complex of buildings?</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto"><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000">Answer:&nbsp; VRI services would be available from the ISP office using LC equipment onsite to connect to the Sorenson videophones at the individuals desk (for brief consults with hearing colleagues). VRI would also be provided by the contractor calling from an offsite location to LC would used as a back up in the event that we cannot coordinate services of an interpreter onsite.</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto">16.&nbsp; Are CART services currently utilized by employees?&nbsp; If yes, is the service provided by an on-site CART writer or by a remote audio and data connection?</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto"><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000">Answer:&nbsp; CART has been provided both by an onsite provider and provided by a remote provider. In both cases, the contractor used their own transcription equipment connected to an LC monitor.</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto">17.&nbsp; Are Computer Assisted Note taking (CAN) services currently utilized by LOC employees?&nbsp; If yes, is the service provided on-site or remotely?</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto"><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000">Answer:&nbsp; CAN has been used only several times on site via a laptop and an volunteer typists.</span></strong><br /><br />18.&nbsp; Can you please clarify the purpose of CLIN 004?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto"><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000">Answer:&nbsp; For the use of the equipment provided by the contractor, specify how the cost will be charged, i.e., cost per hour, percent for overhead, etc. </span></strong></p>
<p>19.&nbsp; Some interested parties wanted to know if there is another option for the Financial Data requirement besides the audited financials or the D&amp;B Financial Report? This can be a Hugh cost for small business.&nbsp; Are financial records endorsed by a company's accountant and/or CFO suffice for this requirement?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000">An interested party can send what their CFO certifies and the CO can confirm the information with our legal department.&nbsp; Keep in mind that if they reject the financial information as being legally insufficient, your bid could be declared as 'Non Responsive".</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">21.&nbsp; Does the interpreter desk currently have its own Sorenson videophone for communicating with LOC employees?</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto"><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000">Answer:&nbsp; For the use of the equipment provided by the contractor, specify how the cost will be charged, i.e., cost per hour, percent for overhead, etc. </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000">In addition, the &nbsp;LOC simply wants ALL interested parties to bid with the intent of fulfilling the requirements as stated in the solicitation.&nbsp; As an interested party, the LOC is requesting that ALL interested parties submit a proposal that covers all requirements outlined in the solicitation to be considered as a 'Responsive Offeror'.&nbsp; There is an incumbent, but the LOC has determined that there is a need for a new contract instead of exercising the option to extend the term of the existing contract.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;There will be some revisions to the actual solicitation document, please review.</p>

<SUBJECT>Morocco:  Essaouira Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant Technical Assistance
<SOLNBR>2011-21010A
<RESPDATE>040811
<CONTACT>Nina Patel, Phone (703) 875-4357, Email npatel@ustda.gov
<DESC>Reference is made to the February 18, 2011 announcement, reference number 2010- 21010A, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data for the Morocco: Essaouira Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant Technical Assistance.
<p>The following clarifications have been provided by the Grantee and/or USTDA in response to questions received:</p>
<p><br />1.	Q:  "It is not clear from the description of Task 1 who will provide site specific solar resource data, i.e. direct normal insolation (DNI) and diffuse radiation data on hourly basis. Are ambient conditions, i.e. temperature, pressure, and relative humidity data available? What is the source for the data?"<br />A:  ADEREE has global solar radiation and temperature of the region of Essaouira.  However, as mentioned in the annex of the TOR, the contractor should work with the National Meteorology Department to get other data: pressure, relative humidity, direct and diffuse radiation data on hourly basis. Otherwise, the contractor should use simulation software if hourly data are not available (mainly the DNI).</p>
<p>2.	Q:  "Does the National Meteorology Department (DMN) have solar insolation data for a typical year? Will this resource be adequate to estimate performance of PV systems?"<br />A:  The National Meteorology Department (DMN) has simulated (not measured) solar insolation data for a typical year for the region of Essaouira.  This data should be adequate to estimate performance of PV systems, but DNI data should be necessary to estimate performance of other PV systems (Task 4).</p>
<p>3.	Q:  "Will ONE provide the basis to develop electricity consumption, generation and demand projections?  Does ONE have their internal load growth and new generation projections available for review?"<br />A:  ADEREE, within Task 1, should conduct [this work] with the contractor, meeting with ONE to get electricity consumption, generation and demand projections.  ONE have their internal load growth and could give to the contractor their new generation projections for review.</p>
<p>4.	Q:  "Are there sites that have been flagged as potential sites or will the Contractor need to choose all of the potential sites?"<br />A:  There are no sites that have been flagged as potential sites so far.  The Contractor, with the help of ADEREE, ONE and local authorities, should find out and choose one of the potential sites.</p>
<p>5.	Q:  "In Section 4 [of the RFP] a mechanical engineer is listed as a member of key staff.  We feel that a civil engineer would be a more useful key staff member.  May we include a civil engineer instead of a mechanical engineer without harming our evaluation rating?"<br />A:  We [ADEREE] agree that a civil engineer would be a more useful key staff member than mechanical engineer.</p>
<p>6.	Q:  "In the deliverable for Task 5, what is meant by application requirements?"<br />A:  It means that the contractor should verify that all the requirements, technical tools, equipment and or workforce necessary to carry out installation, operation and maintenance activities are locally available regarding site location and area characteristics.</p>
<p>7.	Q:  "In Task 6, it is noted that the design/specifications should include "systems utility balance." Can you clarify what is being requested?"<br />A:  It means an estimation of the PV energy cover rate of energy regarding electricity demand at the preferred site</p>
<p>8.	Q:  "In Task 6, it is noted that the design/specifications should include "system performance and specifications." Can you clarify what is being requested?"<br />A:  Essentially the estimation of the energy output and performance during the year (simulation for 12 months) regarding climatic data and energy balance with the national/local grid or local electricity consumption.</p>
<p>9.	Q:  "The RFP notes that a statement confirming the availability of the proposed project manager and key staff over the duration of the project must be included.  Is it sufficient to note in the text of the proposal that all staff and the manager will be available?  Or is a separate letter from the Offeror and all subcontractors affirming availability required?"<br />A:  A separate, brief letter confirming availability from each proposed team member is required.</p>
<p>10.	Q:  "Section 3.5 of the proposal reads "as many as possible but not more than six relevant and verifiable project references..." Is this accurate or should it read &lsquo;less than six'"?<br />A:  This is accurate.  Six project references should be included if possible, or as many as possible up to six (but not more).</p>
<p>11.	Q:  "Task 2 notes that the Contractor is to assess the availability and/or suitability for access roads to all parts of the site.  By this, are you noting that the Contractor should consider whether it is possible and appropriate to install access roads on the footprint of the solar project? Roads leading to the project?  Something else?"<br />A:  The Contractor must assess whether access roads exist and are available for use both to and within the proposed site(s).</p>
<p>12.	Q:  "Task 5 notes that "the design criteria documents shall apply to the Pilot Project, and shall be adaptable as model documents for future plants."  For clarification, this means that the documents should be specific to the Pilot Project but written in such a way that they can be tweaked and used for other projects?"<br />A:  Yes, this Pilot Project is intended to be replicable.  The design documents should therefore be specific to the Pilot Project but adaptable for use at different sites.</p>
<p>13.	Q:  "The deliverable for Task 5 notes that the design specifications and operation and maintenance procedures should be based on permitting and regulatory requirements.  There may be specifications and procedures that go beyond these requirements.  Should such specifications and procedures be included, as well?"<br />A:  Where possible, the design specifications and operation and maintenance procedures should be as complete as possible, so additional specifications and procedures may be included.</p>
<p>14.	Q:  "Task 6 lists both &lsquo;major equipment list' and &lsquo;instrument index.' Can you describe how these differ?"<br />A:  The major equipment list will contain specific information such as sizing, whereas the instrument index will simply list what was included in the deliverable for this Task.</p>
<p>15.	Q:  "Task 9 notes that the Contractor will assess mechanisms to enable private sector participation. Could you clarify whether you are referring to participation in the Pilot Project or in the Moroccan solar industry?<br />A:  This Task refers to private sector participation in the Moroccan solar industry.<br />16.	Q:  "In Task 12 the Contractor is asked to develop an RFP for the installation of the pilot project.  Has the financing mechanism under which the pilot project will be installed been determined?  For example, the project could be built under a BOT (build, operate and transfer) scheme, a BOO (build, own, operate) scheme, a BOOT (build, own, operate and transfer) scheme, or some other financial structure.  If the mechanism has not been determined, do you want the Contractor to suggest a mechanism?"<br />A:  The financing structure has not been determined and the contractor will prepare a recommendation for the Grantee (Task 9).</p>
<p>17.	Q:  "In Task 12 there is a bulleted list of items for inclusion in the RFP. Is this information that you would like the RFP to specify, that you would like RFP to ask the bidder to provide, or a mixture of the two?"<br />A:  The bulleted points are meant to be areas that a prospective bidder will need to respond to in order to successfully compete for implementation of this Pilot Project.</p>
<p>18.	Q:  "Do you know if the construction contractor will or has to be a Morocco based entity?"<br />A:  Per USTDA Nationality Requirements (Annex III of the RFP), the contractor for this technical assistance project must be a U.S. company.  However, they are permitted to subcontract up to 20% of the value of this grant to local (i.e. Moroccan) firms.  It is up to the Offeror to decide who and how they would like to propose as their contracting team.</p>
<p>19.	Q:  "Has a contractor has been selected?"<br />A:  A contractor has not been selected, either for the present technical assistance activity or the implementation phase of the proejct.  Based on the proposals received through this RFP process, the project sponsor will select the best qualified Offeror to conduct this technical assistance activity.</p>
<p>20.	Q:  "Can you confirm what percent of the $631,000 grant by the USTDA will be of  the total consulting costs or estimated?"<br />A:  This grant is a fixed-price grant.  It is up to the Offeror to determine if the sum is sufficient for their purposes to perform the technical assistance project.</p>
<p>21.	Q:  "What is the best form to send the final copy? In other words - is UPS or FedEx reliable?"<br />A:  USTDA makes no recommendation on a particular carrier.  However, it is recommended to allow at least one week for delivery to the indicated address.<br />22.	Q:  "What is the typical delivery timeline for an overnight courier?"<br />A:  The Offeror will need to determine this answer through their selected courier.</p>
<p>N.B.  A few questions are outstanding and will be answered in a subsequent RFP amendment.</p>

Facility Roof Infrared Survey
 
a.	Contractor to provide 20 aerial infrared photos and CD files of Buildings No. 1, 2, 3, 11, 24 and 29 roofing system.   All infrared2K studies use the following format.

b.	1) Written Overview of the Study itself
 
c.	2) Four up first page, by Building roof shot. All shots are approximately 300' by 300' so small buildings can be combined with larger ones depending upon ICC Operations Mission planning.  This first page features a control daytime photo (JPEG), always in the upper left.  The nighttime Military grade Thermogram, always in the upper right.  The Patent Process IR2K image in the lower Left for easy comparison to the daytime control photo. To complete this 1st page there is a Campus/Building key shot in the lower right with the actual shot framed for reference.

d.	3) The 2nd page is always a Zoomed in shot of the particular roof under examination from the previous 4 up page.  This allows the Building owner to examine their roof in an expanded format.

e.	The balance of the IR2k Roof report then steps through all planned mission shots of your specified Campus rooftops, individually by rooftop, until the entire survey is complete.  This report is delivered to you printed on 130 pound glossy photographic paper, and the same exact same files are also delivered to you upon a CD with full copying/printing rights In summary the Building Owner receives one printed hard copy report and one CD report.

f.	In regard to ICC Option delivery, the rooftop AutoCAD arrives approximately two weeks after the delivery of the hard copy and CD IR2k report.  It will be indexed and sequenced in the exact same manner as the hard Copy reports.  A Building Owner receives both a printed AutoCAD of the individual Rooftop and a CD with the AutoCAD layers with full printing/copying rights.
  
g.	If a Scaled report is ordered for the initial IR2K Study all subsequent ICC Options are then available to a Building owner, i.e., Rooftop AutoCAD, Geo-Spatial Campus mapping into AutoCAD, and X-ref embedding of the rooftop AutoCAD into Geo-Spatial Site Plan AutoCAD.  Scaling is a prerequisite for all of these Options and IC's Scaling is to AIA standards, i.e., for rooftops Scaling is generally between 1" = 20' and 1" = 50' depending upon building size, while for Campus Site Plan AutoCAD the Scale is generally 1" = 100' up to 1" = 150.'

h.	As you know, the Bonham, VA has requested (20) specified JPEG daytime shots of the Bonham, VA Campus.  ICC will provide these for the same price as our Campus mapping into AutoCAD.  We will also provide the daytime JPEG imagery of your Bonham Campus in one large viewable Campus JPEG.  This custom option does NOT include the mapping of the entire Bonham Campus into AutoCAD layers. Additionally, ICC will provide these custom JPEG shots based upon the Bonham VA's specification.  For each planned shot ICC will require; 1) Helicopter Elevation 2) shot direction, such as east shooting to the West 3) the building(s) to be included in each shot, or "Full Campus" to be specified.

i.	MOISTURE IN LOW SLOPE ROOFING AND SCALED CAMPUS SITE-PLAN SURVEY

j.	Infrared Camera must meet or exceed the following specifications: spectral sensitivity with a range from 3-5 microns, focal plan array detector of at least 320 X 240 InSb elements, thermal sensitivity of < 0.10 degrees Celsius.  Infrared Camera Equipment that shall be deemed acceptable for the purposes of this survey shall include; FLIR Corporation's - Ultra 7500, FLIR - MilCAM RECON, FLIR - DS, INDIGO Corporation's Indigo - Merlin, or INDIGO -Phoenix.

k.	Daytime Digital Control imagery and Nighttime Aerial Infrared Thermographic imagery must be taken from a data collection "platform" moving at no more than 10 miles per hour and at an altitude between 500 feet minimum and 700 feet maximum above the structure being surveyed.  Data Capture platform shall move along and above the building's centerline with no more than a 15 degree deviation from vertical on all thermographic imagery.

l.	All thermographic data shall be captured at night and must be digitally computer processed and digitally computer enhanced with false positives removed prior to digital computer analysis for moisture penetration identification of areas as small as 2 square feet.  Further analysis by an Industry Certified Thermograher shall take place following the application of the preceding processes to the raw data.

m.	All processed nighttime thermograms shall be overlaid and/or married upon a daytime photograph of the same building structure to enable accurate registration of the indications of sub-membrane moisture.

n.	Manual/Analog (Hand) transfer of thermographic data to a rectified daytime control image is NOT an acceptable process for the purposes of performing the work noted within this bid specification.  Simple importing of relevant images into a computer or the use of Photoshop to clean smeared data images does not meet the specification of utilizing a software analysis program calibrated to specifically analyze thermographic images in order to identify sub-membrane moisture.  

o.	False Positives shall be removed from the Infrared imagery by utilizing a Moisture Analyst with more than 5 years of experience in the analysis of roof thermographic data for purposes of moisture delineation.

p.	All finished reports must be provided in a 6" X 8" computer processed and analyzed format of each 50,000-60,000 square foot, or less, section.  The locations of thermal anomalies consistent with distinguishing between wet and dry insulation shall be delineated.  All probable areas of moisture must be clearly indicated in shades of red or another color.  The report shall also include daytime photographs of the same structures and an enlarged, fully moisture analyzed infrared image of each roof or roof section.

q.	Two sets of all finished reports shall be provided in each of the following formats: 

Letter-size, loose leaf bound, full color on heavy gloss, 7 mil photographic paper stock, or equivalent.PDF and DWG files saved on a Compact Disc.

r.	 All processed imagery shall be scaled in accordance with industry standard practices, such as 1" = 50'-0", or less.  Roofs larger than 60,000 square feet shall be sectioned into report areas of less than 60,000 square feet with the maximum allowable deviation on all scaled imagery of less than 2%.  It is the contractor's responsibility to secure all building dimensions upon which report scaling will be conducted.  

s.	A North indicator and key shall be included on each processed image.  
All final reporting must meet or exceed ASTM guideline C1153-99 (American Society for Testing & Materials: Standard Practice for Location of Wet Insulation in Roofing Systems using Infrared Imaging).

t.	AutoCAD reports shall be provided on all surveyed rooftops in DWG file format.  Separate AutoCAD layers for the rooftop information shall include the following: all anomalous moisture intrusions; vents, ducts, pipes, HVAC units, and other identifiable planned penetrations of the roof-top.  A separate AutoCAD file shall be provided for each rooftop greater than 60,000 square feet and/or divided into multiple reports.  Each AutoCAD report must include an analysis of the total square feet of each rooftop, the square feet of anomalies, and the percentage of anomalies in the report section.

u.	Scaled campus site plan surveys that clearly and accurately define the spatial AutoCAD layers and colors.  Plans shall be provided in the DWG file format and saved on a CD which also includes the imagery taken of each campus.  Building Owner shall have the unrestricted right and ability to produce unlimited quantities of prints or images from each scaled campus site plan.  The maximum allowable deviation on all scaled imagery shall be less than 2%.

v.	All reports and imagery must be delivered and explained to Building Owner staff by an experienced representative at a campus location to be specified.  ICC's representative shall be available to the Building Owner staff for up to two (2) hours in order to perform the training session explaining the thermographic IR2K images, while presenting a strategy, and answering any related Survey questions. 

w.	The survey will be conducted within 30 days of the receipt of the notice to proceed by contractor.  The survey will be completed within 60 days from the notice to proceed.

<DESC>This announcement is to provide additional information regarding the 7 April 2011 site visit at Makua Military Reservation, Hawaii.<br><br>During the site visit, Contractors will be given an opportunity drive (4WD vehicles required - no POVs) on the firebreak road on Makua Military Reservation up to the point of the blue trail that provides access to the cultural sites listed in the draft PWS.  Those cultural sites cannot be accessed during the site visit due to the fact that the blue trail has not undergone a UXO clearance and the long duration of time that it takes to hike the entire blue trail.  Any Contractors who are UXO Technician Level 1 or above will be allowed access to the blue trail for a limited amount of time so they may see topography, terrain, etc.   Contractors may use handheld detection equipment (such as Minelab Explorer or similar) during the site visit.  However intrusive investigation or digging is strictly prohibited during the site visit.<br>

<CONTACT>James E. Norton , Procurement Technician , Email james_norton@blm.gov
<DESC><p>The purpose of the amendment is to correct the location of the project area as indicated below: The Bureau of Land Management proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award of a contract to Walker Research Group LTD to conduct an ethnographic study in order to identify properties of historic, traditional, contemporary, and ongoing religious and cultural significance and importance to the Shashone-Paiute Tribes of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation. The Idaho Power Company has applied for a right-of-way grant for the Boardman to Hemingway 500 kV transmission line across federal lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management/Forest Service/Bureau of Reclamation (hereafter referred to as &iquest;Federal Agencies&iquest;) in eastern Oregon and southwest Idaho. Federal Agencies are mandated to consult with tribal governments whose interests might be directly and substantially affected by activities authorized on federal lands. The purpose of this study is to document Shoshone-Paiute use and reliance on the natural and cultural resources within the area of potential effect. Data review will include interviews with knowledgeable tribal elders to locate and identify properties of potential traditional cultural and religious significance. It is believed that the Walker Research Group is the only entity with access to Shoshone-Paiute elders and records necessary to complete the study. A final ethnographic report will include: Site maps (where approved by the Tribes); A bibliography of the literature reviewed; A thorough discussion of the methods used in conducting the study and interviews; A summary of major findings; and To the extent permitted by the Tribes, the identification of resources and properties of traditional religious and cultural importance by the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes. This information will be used in consultation with the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes and the development of the Environmental Impact Statement for the Boardman to Hemingway 500kV transmission line project. This acquisition is pursuant to 41 USC 253(c), Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition. The applicable NAICS code is 541720. All parties who possess the skills and access to the required tribal information may submit their qualifications statement evidencing such to the BLM, referencing L11PS00296 via email to or952mb@blm.gov or facsimile at 503-808-6312 by 4:15 pm, March 30, 2011, local time (PST). This is NOT a Request for Quotation; the Government does not anticipate issuing a written solicitation. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to correct the small business size standard for NAICS code 541620 from $20 million to $7 million. See below.
This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time. All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration. Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offers to perform this type of work. The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is: 541620 Environmental Consulting Services. The small business size standard for NAICS Code 541620 is $7 million. 
The proposed requirement is for technical modeling assistance using the Colorado River Simulation System (CRSS) and Spanish translation of CRSS concepts and results in support of binational technical modeling discussions with Mexico.
The binational modeling work group, comprised of technical representatives from the U.S. and Mexico, was started in 2009 to develop and analyze joint strategies for Colorado River management in light of ongoing drought and declining reservoir levels. This effort was successful in 2010, providing the hydrologic impact analysis behind Minute 318 signed in December. In 2011, the binational modeling work group will continue to provide technical analysis in support of a more comprehensive longer-term agreement between the U.S. and Mexico. Prior to technical discussions resume in April, Reclamation is considering acquiring expertise for the U.S. contingent that is well versed in CRSS and proficient in the Spanish language. This would minimize the risk of important technical details being overlooked or misinterpreted during these discussions.
Reclamation is seeking at least five years of modeling experience using CRSS, fluency in the Spanish language, and experience interpreting and communicating technical CRSS concepts and results in Spanish. Responsibilities would include meeting attendance, CRSS model and rule set development, examination and analysis of CRSS results, and presentation of technical CRSS modeling concepts and results in Spanish and English.
The project period of performance (5 months) is anticipated to begin April 1, 2011 with an anticipated completion date of August 31, 2011, with the possibility of extension depending on the requirements of the binational process. 
Should you be interested in this effort, please submit a capability package to Ms. Cris Forbes at the address listed below. Capability statements are to be submitted no later than March 21, 2011.  The capability statement shall address the work listed above, demonstrate the company's capability to perform the work, and describe previous procurements performed of similar size and complexity. Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall include company name and address, business size and type (8(a), HubZone, Small Business, etc), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number. Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length. This information will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in developing the procurement strategy, in particular, including whether an 8(a) or Hubzone set-aside is warranted or if another socio-economic set-aside strategy is more appropriate. 
All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Ms. Cris Forbes, Contract Specialist, P. O. Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail mforbes@usbr.gov. 
When it is determined that a formal solicitation will be issued, a pre-solicitation notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK<br>For Professional Development Training Workshop (PDTW)<br>Combat and Operational Stress First Aid (COSFA) development workshop FY-11<br>For the Arizona National Guard<br><br>1.0  INTRODUCTION<br><br>1.1  Purpose.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide contractor support to develop and deliver a Professional Development Training Workshop (PDTW) for Arizona National Guard Service Members and their Families.  Further, the Arizona National Guard requires contract support to hold a symposium and planning meeting to develop a National Guard Combat and Operational Stress First Aid (COSFA) curriculum to be delivered at one PDTW for the Arizona National Guard Service Members and their Families.<br><br>1.2  Background.  Family Programs in conjunction with the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program are responsible for sponsoring, developing and presenting the COSFA model for Arizona National Guard Service Members and families.  The PDTW will be an ongoing event conducted in Phoenix, Arizona, beginning upon the approval of the contract and continuing when services are requested. The purpose of the PDTW is to prepare the above personnel personally and professionally to facilitate and provide crisis care and awareness for Arizona National Guard personnel and other authorized members of the Department of the Army. The COSFA development workshop will also ensure that Arizona National Guard Service Members are prepared to effectively deliver inclusive operational stress care and provide training to other Service Members to help identify Service Members and their Families who are at risk. <br><br>The Arizona National Guard has identified the need and will implement the developed model of Combat Stress First Aid (COSFA) to be used in the aftermath of crisis events, which differs from traditional models of immediate stress intervention.  The COSFA implementation will create a curriculum, which will be developed into a PDTW held in Phoenix, Arizona, at the Arizona National Guard Papago Park Military Reservation upon approval of the contract and for future dates upon request. There will also be a second three-day PDTW conducted in the future at a later date to be determined. The curriculum shall entail the following components: 1. Introduction to the framework of the COSFA model, 2. Skills based training on how to use the stress first aid model for individuals in crisis, 3. How to use the stress first aid model to respond to units in distress, and 4. How to guide commands on the use and utility of the COSFA model.<br><br>1.3  Scope.  The contractor shall develop and deliver a Professional Development Training Course (PDTC). This project will require development of a curriculum and relevant training support materials, curriculum validation and curriculum implementation. A select representative group determined by the Arizona National Guard will validate the curriculum upon approval of the contract, which will be held at the Arizona National Guard Papago Park Military Reservation in Phoenix, Arizona. <br><br>The contractor shall develop all logistical needs to create a three-day conference to implement COSFA as a crisis intervention into the Arizona National Guard.  The outcome of this conference will be the development and validation of a content and curriculum, as well as trained personnel within the National Guard who will be able to inform and educate other potential trainers and provide services to those Service Members and families needing crisis intervention. This PDTW will be delivered in Phoenix, Arizona.<br><br>1.4  Security Classification.  This SOW and the initial training materials under procurement are unclassified.<br><br>2.0  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS<br><br>The following specifications shall apply to this project:<br><br>2.1  Military Standards.  <br><br>MIL-PRF 29612B, Performance Specification, Training Data Products<br>MIL-HDBKs 29612B, Parts 1-5, Training Data Products<br><br>2.2  Technical References.  <br><br>International Association of Continuing Education and Training (IACET.

<DESC>Vendor will provide books and library publications (non serial publications) in paper and other formats and associated acquisition support services to federal libraries, information centers, and other federal offices worldwide. The RFP offered four Lots which define four different but related aspects of books and library publications acquisitions: Lot 1 Firm Order Services; Lot 2 Approval Plan Services; Lot 3 Leasing Plan Service; and Lot 4 Technical and/or Order Processing Services. Lot 1 is essential - Vendors had to qualify under Lot 1 in order to provide services under the other Lots. Lot 1 Firm Order Services covers firm orders, a one time order for a specific title (or specific titles) and number of copies, in contrast to a subscription or standing order. For Lot 2, Approval Plans, a vendor automatically supplies materials potentially required by a library as they are published, based on a detailed profile of the library's collection needs. The library may return any publications deemed unsuitable for addition to the collection and is only billed for items retained. For Lot 3, Leasing Plan Services, the customer leases publications from the supplier instead of buying them and retains an option to purchase leased items at a reduced price when the term of the lease is over. For Lot 4, Technical and/or Order Processing Services, the vendor may provide technical processing for materials supplied under the BOA, performing physical processing or cataloging in order to supply materials to the customer in shelf ready condition. The vendor may provide a computer based order processing system for the customer to make the acquisitions control process more efficient.

<AWARDEE>Findaway World, LLC., 31999 Aurora Road, Solon, OH 44139 US
<DESC>Vendors will provide books and library publications (non serial publications) in paper and other formats and associated acquisition support services to federal libraries, information centers, and other federal offices worldwide. The RFP offered four Lots which define four different but related aspects of books and library publications acquisitions: Lot 1 Firm Order Services; Lot 2 Approval Plan Services; Lot 3 Leasing Plan Service; and Lot 4 Technical and/or Order Processing Services. Lot 1 is essential - Vendors had to qualify under Lot 1 in order to provide services under the other Lots. Lot 1 Firm Order Services covers firm orders, a one time order for a specific title (or specific titles) and number of copies, in contrast to a subscription or standing order. For Lot 2, Approval Plans, a vendor automatically supplies materials potentially required by a library as they are published, based on a detailed profile of the library's collection needs. The library may return any publications deemed unsuitable for addition to the collection and is only billed for items retained. For Lot 3, Leasing Plan Services, the customer leases publications from the supplier instead of buying them and retains an option to purchase leased items at a reduced price when the term of the lease is over. For Lot 4, Technical and/or Order Processing Services, the vendor may provide technical processing for materials supplied under the BOA, performing physical processing or cataloging in order to supply materials to the customer in shelf ready condition. The vendor may provide a computer based order processing system for the customer to make the acquisitions control process more efficient.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>This requirement is for non-personal forensic pathology and support services for the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System (AFMES) in support of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).  The AFMES is comprised of five integrated divisions, whose overall mission is to determine clinically and scientifically the cause of death of US service members, and in certain situations US service member dependents, federal government officials, and civilians not otherwise affiliated with the DoD worldwide.  The Contractor will support this mission by providing qualified personnel, services, materials, equipment, supplies, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, necessary to perform professional scientific, administrative and logistical support.  The Contractor will also be required to transition, using a three (3) phase move plan, during the relocation of AFMES operations from Rockville, MD to Dover AFB, DE.  Phased movements will require dual operations for a minimum of 12 months and the Contractor will be required to provide a Continuity Team resourced with technical, administrative, logistical, and bioinformatics support.

<ARCHDATE>04172011
<DESC>This requirement is for non-personal forensic pathology and support services for the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System (AFMES) in support of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).  The AFMES is comprised of five integrated divisions, whose overall mission is to determine clinically and scientifically the cause of death of US service members, and in certain situations US service member dependents, federal government officials, and civilians not otherwise affiliated with the DoD worldwide.  The Contractor will support this mission by providing qualified personnel, services, materials, equipment, supplies, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, necessary to perform professional scientific, administrative and logistical support.  The Contractor will also be required to transition, using a three (3) phase move plan, during the relocation of AFMES operations from Rockville, MD to Dover AFB, DE.  Phased movements will require dual operations for a minimum of 12 months and the Contractor will be required to provide a Continuity Team resourced with technical, administrative, logistical, and bioinformatics support.  The purpose of dual operations is to ensure accreditation standards are maintained, while continuing to operate fully functional laboratories, in both locations.  This may include required daily travel between both locations and/or work in either primary office during the transition.  This support will primarily be responsible for maintaining mission support operations as AFIP executes the base realignment and closure (BRAC) transition plan.
