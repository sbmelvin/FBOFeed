<DESC>This is a presolicitation synopsis for worldwide laboratory testing and sampling at a central laboratory. As part of a coordinated Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), United States Navy (USN), and United States Coast Guard (USCG) effort to monitor commercial distillate fuel quality, approximately 49 USCG vessels have been equipped with in line fuel sampling flanges and several Navy ships are in the process of being equipped.  The sampling flanges, supplied as Government furnished equipment (GFE), have been installed in the vessel bunker manifold at the custody transfer point.  A continuous drip sample will be collected by ships personnel from the custody transfer point into a 10-liter disposable sample container.  The sample will be decanted into a 1-gallon shipping container for transport to the in-line sampling laboratory for analysis.  In-line bunkering samples will be obtained for every commercial fuel product taken onboard participating USCG vessels and in select ports for USN vessels.  This will include both DESC Bunker Contracts and Open Market purchases worldwide.  The in-line sampling shipping materials supplied by the Contractor shall include a set of domestic and international shipping labels so that the routine in-line bunker sample may be shipped from the vessel to the Contractor for analysis.  Therefore, the Contractor shall be responsible for a turn-key operation, which includes as a minimum assembling the in-line fuel sampling collection kit, shipping the kits to USCG and USN vessels worldwide, maintaining and updating the in-line fuel sampling instruction manual, the ability to ship fuel samples domestically and/or internationally to the designated analysis laboratory, conducting the required fuel sample analyses, and reporting of the results to DESC, USCG, and USN.

The Defense Energy Support Center intends to issue solicitation SP0600-08-R-0534 on or after October 17, 2008 for this requirements type contract.  Base period of performance is April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010 with three (3) successive one-year option periods.  This is an unrestricted procurement with full and open competition.  This will be a fixed price contract.

All responsible sources are invited to submit offers once the solicitation is issued. DESC anticipates conducting negotiations with offerors submitting proposals under the subject solicitation listed above but reserves the right to make contract award based on initial offers submitted.

<DESC>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent immunologic, infectious, and allergic diseases. The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) supports extramural basic, pre-clinical and clinical research focusing on immune-mediated diseases through a variety of research grants and contracts. 

Since 1991, DAIT NIAID has supported research programs to develop effective behavioral, educational and environmental interventions to reduce asthma severity among inner city children.
The NIAID Inner City Asthma Consortium was established in FY2002 under a contract to the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The current NIAID Inner City Asthma Consortium is composed of an administrative center and ten clinical sites. A separate contract to establish and operate a Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center to support the clinical research program of the Consortium is in place. Ongoing and completed studies have focused on the standardization of cockroach allergens and on biomarker evaluation to guide asthma treatment. Ongoing studies include a prospective, longitudinal evaluation of environmental factors that influence the development of the immune system and asthma and Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of immunotherapeutic modalities.  
The Inner City Asthma Consortium will expand its focus on the immunopathogenesis of asthma in inner city populations through the addition of Basic Science Sites. 
The overall objectives of the Inner City Asthma Consortium are to: 
1.	Design and conduct clinical studies with the goals of a) improving asthma control, b) preventing the development of asthma in children residing in the inner cities of the United States using primarily immune system-targeting interventions, and c) improving asthma phenotyping using validated biomarkers. 
2.	Design and conduct longitudinal birth cohort studies with the goals of a) providing novel information on the early immunopathogenesis of asthma, b) identifying risk factors for the development of asthma in children residing in the inner cities of the United States, c) understanding differences in the early immunopathogenesis of asthma between inner city and non-inner city children, and d) developing studies to prevent the development of asthma. 
3. 	Design and conduct mechanistic studies involving human subjects with the goal of elucidating the immunopathogenesis of asthma in the inner city environment.
4. 	Develop, validate and implement basic science methodology to support the studies conducted under objectives 1, 2 and 3 listed above.

It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded for a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately September 2009, with an anticipated annual total effort of approximately 67.8 FTEs for the Base period. 

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:
                                                                                                          CRITERIA WEIGHT

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This procurement is for Janitorial & Related Services at Midway International Airport, Transportation Security Administration Leased Space, Chicago, Illinois  60638.

Briefly, and without force and effect upon contract documents, work of contract can be summarized as follows.  The Contractor shall provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, repair parts, tools, and equipment to provide janitorial services at space leased by the General Services Administration (GSA) on behalf of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at Midway International Airport.  

Constraints Inherent to the Place of Performance:  No storage space for janitorial supplies will be provided for under this requirement.  GSA cannot provide access to janitorial closets and running water.  No areas for trash storage and removal (including no dumpster access) will be provided for under this requirement.  GSA cannot provide access to trash areas.   No access to any places on the grounds of MDW, except those areas leased by GSA for TSAs purposes.   Areas to be services are disjointed and non-adjacent.  The areas are spread throughout the airport.  The Government does not have the authority to grant firms any additional space for storage or trash removal purposes.  The Government does not have access to any areas beyond space occupied by TSA.

This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is a negotiated procurement and is open to all business concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561720 with a small business size standard of $16.5 million.  

The solicitation package will be available on or about October 15, 2008.  The solicitation cited above can accessed on FedBizOpps.  The solicitation will be designated as sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.   

The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.ccr.gov.   

Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. 

Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation. Mail, facsimile, telephonic or electronic mail requests will not be honored.

The information received to support this sole source reveals that the environment in the Hawthorne, NV area closely resembles that of Afghanistan, consequently providing the most realistic training environment for these soldiers. Further, HQ, Army Sustainment Command issued a no-cost agreement to SOC LLC for sole use of the ranges on Hawthorne Army Depot. This agreement limits the use of the ranges to provide training to soldiers to SOC LLC only. This notice is not a request for offers. The anticipated date of award is 7 Oct 08. Because of the inability of any other contractor to obtain authority to train on these ranges, and because it is necessary for the soldiers to train during this period and in this environment, the contractor identified is the only known source for the subject requirement. Responses to this notice will be used to determine if bona fide competition exists to provide pre-mission training at Hawthorne Army Depot. Any such responses must be in writing and include documents that clearly demonstrate the ability to train on the Hawthorne Army Depot and have full use of the installation ranges and other facilities. The training shall include Special Forces Basic Combat Course, Improvised Explosive Training, Full Mission Profile Training, Dismounted and Mounted Live Fire Training, Counter Ambush Training, and Key Leader Engagement. The contractor shall provide knowledgeable instructors, billeting, vehicles, classrooms, chairs, tables, pneumatic steel target range with moving targets, communications equipment, weapons with ammunition, role players with Afghanistan-like clothing, maintenance, repair, and trash removal. All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered; however, determination to compete or not to compete this requirement is solely at the discretion of the Government. No extensions will be granted. The Government will not pay for any information submitted. Only electronic submissions will be accepted. No telephone responses will be accepted. The point of contact for this requirement is Ms.  Ella Porter, Contract Specialist, e-mail: portere@soc.mil.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request. This request for information is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.  The company shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research.

1. SCOPE. 
Background: Peace Corps currently has an online donation process.  The process can be cumbersome and may dissuade donors from using the website (www.peacecorps.gov/contribute) as a means to contribute.  In order to donate to the Peace Corps on the Office of Private Sector Initiatives (OPSI) webpage, visitors either enter the overarching Peace Corps website, click on the "Donate Now" button, and then click on a project, country, or special fund "donate" button or start on the contribute landing page.  This is then followed by three or four more clicks before a donation is complete.  Additionally, the current page does not draw a donors attention to specific projects or information about OPSI, due to a lack of project specific pictures and/or eye-catching layout.

The Office of Private Sector Initiatives (OPSI) would like to improve the look, feel, and functionality of the "Donate Now" portions of the PeaceCorps.gov website (www.peacecorps.gov/contribute).  The website change is expected to:
	Create a more streamlined online donation process, which will potentially increase the number of online donations, and
	Increase visitors and potential donors to the donation portion of the Peace Corps website by providing dynamic information and useful content.

It is important to bear in mind the following overall justifications for the site:
1.	To change the layout to fit functionality  ensuring that the functions will not be forced into the current website layout. The current layout does not fit for new/enhanced functionalities  with pictures attached to each project and different search functions added it may look crowded and busy.  
2.	To make the donor experience easier/better for donors  providing donors with ease of use, making the donation process faster (quick search, allowing recurring donations, providing a shopping cart).  The new website would lay out information more clearly (sorting abilities, amount pledged bar, allow donors to shop for projects, country funds, and/or special funds, showing amount raised, pictures to show actual projects, and sector search function).
3.	To increase website visibility and appeal  adding rotating pictures on the front page, vibrancy, buttons providing quick links to Country Funds, Special Funds and In-Kind donations (Country Funds and Special Funds with their own layout).
4.	To provide OPSI with more donor information  this information will give OPSI the ability to interact with the donors following their donation (receiving specific in honor of/in memory of information, getting permission to send an e-newsletter).

Some of the items to enhance include:

General Requirements: 
- OPSI to be able to upload pictures, text, PDFs, videos, storied from the field (control content in most areas of the website)
- Register email for newsletter
- Update of amount pledged in 1 hour intervals
- Provide a Supporters section to highlight major donors and donations from service/friends of groups
- Rework the Special and Country Funds pages instead of forcing into the Project Page format, rather reformat each of those to be easily viewed and have a quick way to donate

Front Page:
- Including photos on Front Page that will change whenever screen is refreshed 
- Adding menu buttons to top of page, which are static no matter what page a visitor is looking at in the "Donate Now" site
- Special Fund box to change as refresh (a box that will include a button for "more information")

Project Pages:
- Adding pictures to Volunteer Projects and providing new layout 

Donate Page:
- Ability to accept regular/monthly donations (recurring payment schedule)
- Identifying donations that are "in honor of/ in memory of" and linking to a printable PDF form if mailing in donation

Donor Contact Information Page - add the following to current content:
- Name of organization/group (if applicable for donor)
- Name of individual (point of contact if a donation is from a group)
- Email contact (optional for donor)
- Phone (optional for donor)

2. GOAL OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine potential sources and their estimates of cost and time estimates to complete the above (although the goal of this project is to be completed in 2-3 months).  Information may be provided to show various level of support with different cost breakdowns
 
3. CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS: 
Peace Corps Headquarters, 1111 20th Ave NW, Washington DC 20526.

Request for Information:

Support for TSAs Office of Civil Rights and Liberties
Alternative Resolutions to Conflict (ARC)


The Transportation Security Administration is seeking information regarding contractor support to the Office of Civil Rights and Liberties. Consequently, the TSA is soliciting information to determine the availability of capable small business contractors that can accomplish this task.  Information submitted will be used to assist the Government in the continuing development of its acquisition strategy for a nationwide program for support to the Office of Civil Rights and Liberties.

This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning and information purposes and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  

BACKGROUND

The Transportation Security Administration, Office of Civil Rights and Liberties (OCRL) upholds laws, regulations and Executive Orders, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability, sexual orientation and age in employment and the provision of services. The Office is responsible for ensuring that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) does not discriminate against its employees, former employees or applicants for employment and that TSA conduct its programs and activities free of discrimination. 

In addition, the office is responsible for administering the Agencys Alternative Dispute Resolution process in accordance with 29 Code of Federal Regulation 1614(b)(2) which states that an agency shall establish or make available an alternative dispute resolution program that is accessible for the informal and formal complaint process.  TSAs Alternative Resolutions to Conflict (ARC) implements ADR methods in various ways, including facilitated meetings and mediation with the aid of a neutral third party.  This is a voluntary process for individuals initiating the EEO complaint process and has proven to be a worthwhile program.  ARC allows individuals to present and discuss workplace issues, which often times led to resolution of the EEO complaint, thereby avoiding the lengthy and costly litigation process.  ARC has proven to be particularly effective in improving communication and promoting mutual acceptance in the workplace. 
The Informal/ARC Division:

The mission of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Office of Civil Rights and Liberties (OCRL) is to promote equal employment and prevent and eliminate unlawful discrimination in the workplace.  Specifically, the OCRL enforces laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and policies which prohibit unlawful discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, parental status, and protected genetic information.  The OCRL also enforces laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and policies which prohibit retaliation for opposing any practice made unlawful by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the Equal Pay Act, and the Rehabilitation Act, or for participating in any stage of administrative or judicial proceedings under those statutes. In addition Alternative Resolutions to Conflict (ARC) is the alternative dispute resolution program in TSAs Office of Civil Rights and Liberties.

The Informal/Alternative Resolutions to Conflict (ARC) Division is responsible for the prompt, fair, and impartial processing of informal EEO complaints.  The Divisions services begin when someone calls the Office of Civil Rights and Liberties.  An EEO counselor will explain the EEO complaint process and provide information to assist callers in making informed choices on how to proceed, electing between traditional EEO counseling or Alternative Resolutions to Conflict Process to resolve their concern.  In traditional counseling, the Counselor conducts an informal inquiry in an attempt to resolve the issue at the lowest possible level.

Individuals are provided an ARC package which must be completed and returned if the initial conversation with the EEO counselor does not resolve the issue.  Upon return of the ARC package, an EEO counselor is assigned and will begin the EEO process.  If resolution is not obtained, the notice of right to file a formal complaint of discrimination is provided to the complainant to continue the complaint process.

ARC provides complainants, where appropriate, the opportunity to resolve their EEO complaints through a private conversation with their supervisors or managers with the support of a neutral third person.  The ARC process is an employee option to work toward resolving issues informally.  Any agreements reached as a result of these discussions are fashioned by the parties, are voluntary, and follow legal guidelines.  The conversations often result in better communications on a daily basis.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research has a requirement for a one-year membership in the Santa Fe Institute, a non-profit research organization that uses multidisciplinary collaboration to study behavior and structure of complex systems, with emphasis on complex systems that exhibit adaptation and learning. Santa Fe Institute's research into computer simulation systems builds on a broad base of studies in complex adaptive systems. The simulation programs, and more general computational approaches, are built on the concept of adaptive agents capable of learning in response to experience. Many of the approaches incorporate processes that mimic biological systems and organisms, including mutation, generic crossover, evolution and co-evolution, and differential retention of successful genotypes. Areas of work include use of genetic algorithms, classifier systems, neural networks, genetic programming and other related machine learning methods. This Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order will provide for one membership in the Santa Fe Institute Business Network for Complex Systems Research for a period of one year.  The participant will participate in research visits, workshops, technical meetings and seminars, and receive copies of working papers and books resulting from these research programs. This purchase is considered sole source to Santa Fe Institute. Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.

<DESC>Since the terrorist attacks on 11 Sep 01, operational requirements for Command and Control Infrastructure have continued to grow.  There is a need for new and revised regulations and instructions pertaining to physical security and safeguarding of information.  The use of Kaba Ilco card key access system and standard locks will enable management and maintenance of building security and performance of locks and key maintenance throughout all Army Installations under the US Army Garrison-Hawaii.  The standard lock sets provide better secured buildings and more cost affordable systems.  The specific Kaba Ilco card key access system meets the security requirements for the installation.  Also, in accordance with a directive approved by the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management, the Director, Installation Management Agency and the Director for Military Programs on 14 December 2004 and recommendations contained in US Army Corps of Engineers Engineering and Construction Bulletin No. 2005-1, 18 March 2005, the Directorate of Public Works (DPW) has implemented a plan to ensure consistency, compatibility, and sustainability for electronic card key access systems, minimize/consolidate spare parts and stock, and establish a team of well trained maintenance experts.  The salient performance features and characteristics of the electronic card key access system:  expandable, electronics and batteries are located in the inside housing protecting them from the elements and vandalism, hidden mechanical override and removable core, visual and audible operation indicators, operates on standard batteries, event audit trail tracking, real time system, resist forcible entry even though outside lever is twisted off, meets American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and Builders hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA) Grade 1 requirements for lever torque test, has a durable and scratch resistant finish and is guaranteed for two years.  The lock system must be compatible with the following Kaba Ilco Locks:  E-Plex 5000 for all exterior doors, Simplex 5000 series for all interior doors, and Simplex 8100 series for all mechanical, electric and communication rooms.  If there are any responses to this synopsis relative to the New Barracks Complex at Schofield for other than Kaba Ilco lock systems, the responses will be reviewed for merit.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in FAR 15.201e. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI.<BR><BR>The Chemical Biological Medical Systems Joint Project Management Office (CBMS JPMO) is seeking information on the capabilities of various commercial entities in one or more of the areas listed below. The CBMS mission is to rapidly provide the Warfighter with safe, robust, affordable medical countermeasures (MCMs) against a broad spectrum of Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) threats. The current CBMS products include Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed/approved/cleared biologics, drugs, and diagnostic devices.  <BR><BR>The CBMS JPMO is seeking companies with experience and the capability, if necessary to establish a teaming approach concept, to accomplish the development, manufacture and production of CBRN prophylactics, therapeutics, and diagnostics.  Specific functional capabilities include, but are not limited to, (1) program management of technically complex efforts, (2) integration of multiple functional disciplines, (3) technical expertise in pharmaceutical product development, (4) regulatory interactions with the Food and Drug Administration leading to product approval/licensure/clearance under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or Section 351 under the Public Health Service Act, and (5) successful partnering or subcontracting with innovative companies.  Additionally, experience with product development under 21 CFR 314 Subpart I or 601 Subpart H (i.e. Animal Rule) is desired.<BR><BR>Some of the planned requirements for future CBRN prophylactic, therapeutic, or diagnostic systems which could be developed under this future contract may include: <BR>(A) Development, through FDA licensure and production, of a pre-exposure indication filovirus vaccine with a balance of onset and duration of protection for administration to healthy individuals, developed under the Animal rule, and which provides broad spectrum protection against aerosol exposure to multiple species of the Ebola and Marburg viruses. If multivalent Ebola / Marburg is not available as single product, a separate Ebola vaccine providing protection against Zaire and Sudan species along with a separate Marburg vaccine is acceptable. <BR>(B) Development through FDA-approval and production of a central nervous system therapeutic(s) to treat nerve agent intoxication and minimize injury to the central nervous system;  <BR>(C) Development through FDA-approval and production of a new MCM to treat sulfur mustard (HD) poisoning.  HD is a vesicant chemical agent that affects the eyes, lungs, and skin and causes mild to severe or lethal organ damage that degrades Force capabilities; <BR>(D) Development through FDA-clearance and production of a Radiological Biodosimetry Medical Diagnostic Device that will be carried by the individual Warfighter and can be read and interpreted immediately for the efficient and proper triage and subsequent treatment of potential radiation casualties; <BR>(E) Development through FDA-licensure or approval and production of a Radiological Prophylaxis  MCM that is administered before anticipated radiation exposure to prevent or reduce the damage and complex injuries associated with acute radiation syndrome; <BR>(F) Development through FDA-licensure or approval and production of a Cyanide Poisoning Prophylaxis and a Soldier-carried Therapeutic  to protect and treat military members from cyanide poisoning resulting from either ingestion or inhalation of a cyanide chemical agent; <BR>(G) Development of a man-portable Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS) to identify, diagnose, and quantify biological warfare agents in a variety of matrices.<BR><BR>The primary acquisition objective of CBMS is to obtain a contract solution that efficiently, effectively, and economically provides and maintains a high standard for CBRN medical countermeasure advanced development, manufacture, and production to support the Government in meeting DoDs objectives. As such, the Government is seeking information on current industry capability and interest to meet the following criteria:<BR>(A) Provide a seamless/transparent transition from basic and applied research to advanced development.<BR>(B) Perform under a performance-based arrangement, committed to delivering highly reliable and innovative solutions that meet or exceed customer requirements and expectations. <BR>(C) Provide innovative alternative solutions of integrating industry partners and best practices as required to develop MCMs and diagnostic platforms.<BR>(D) Ensure new capability requirements are quickly incorporated into the development process to minimize adverse impacts to long-term operational plans.<BR>(E) Provide continuous, timely, and up-to-date market research and roadmap recommendations based on industry advanced development, manufacturing, and production capability improvements.<BR>(F) Demonstrate existing capabilities to manage each effort, including assuming sponsorship for all products requiring FDA approval.<BR>(G) Perform under a contract type that would allow for a sustained period of time, over option years, during which additional developmental end items falling within a general SOW may be ordered for development through FDA licensure or approval.<BR>(H) Incorporate other enabling technologies critical for the use of pharmaceuticals throughout the contemporary operating environment which include: pharmaceutical stability across a wide range of temperatures, other than syringe and needle administration, individual unique identification (IUID) labeling of individual doses of the pharmaceuticals, and a visual, user-readable temperature to time indicator that confirms the product is usable.<BR><BR>The CBMS JPMO anticipates awarding a contract before March 2010. Questions regarding information required to provide a complete response to this RFI should be forwarded to the Contracting Officer listed below. The CBMS JPMO intends conducting a pre-solicitation conference in FY09 which will provide a forum for open discussion and additional information.<BR><BR>Respondents are invited to provide materials related to their capabilities to fulfill all or any of the CBRN requirements specified above, including: application of best commercial practices; program management structure; products/services technical descriptions (i.e. product data sheets); length of time similar products/services have been provided; cost drivers of advanced development and manufacture of products; number, size, location of suppliers; production capability to meet requirements; quality management system including, quality controls and statistical process controls; intellectual property availability; stability of current configuration / technology, DoD experience, and customer service capability.

Key Date:  Proposal deadline is 2:00pm Alaska time October 30, 2008

STATEMENT OF WORK:Background:The US Fish and Wildlife Service (Service, FWS)  may recover indirect costs associated with work conducted on Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration (NRDAR) activities or response to various types of contaminant spills.  Until recently, several Regions within the Service had no established policies or procedures for calculation of indirect cost.  The policies and procedures that currently exist for calculating indirect costs and documenting NRADR costs vary from Region to Region.
This inconsistency in how each Region compiles the cost documentation package and assesses indirect rates in NRDAR activities leave the FWS vulnerable to legal challenges from Responsible Parties (RPs) as to how indirect costs are calculated and reduces credibility with co-trustees.  When costs are not well documented, they may be dropped from the claim by the Office of Solicitor or Department of Justice.  This is a loss of potential millions of dollars that the FWS might otherwise have been able to recover.  Absorbing indirect costs of NRDAR activities leaves less funding available for other mandated activities.  
Current issues with NRDAR indirect rates include:"	Service-wide rate does not include all NRDAR activities in the base formula"	Inconsistent methods and application of indirect cost rates by Regions"	Some Regions are not including indirect cost as part of settlement"	Unknown data sources to document Regional and Field Office indirect rates"	Most Regions that do recover their indirect cost do not have those cost distributed through FFS
To address inconsistent recovery of indirect cost, the Assistant Director for Fisheries and Habitat Conservation established three teams in December 2005.  One team (Quick Fix Team) was to review existing methods being used within the Service for calculating indirect costs, and then propose a simple interim method for use by Regions lacking a procedure for cost recovery for NRDAR and spill response.  
A second team (Indirect Rate Team) was tasked to review the options for calculating indirect costs at each level of the FWS and either develop a standardized methodology for recovery of FWS indirect costs associated with NRDAR and Spill Response work or oversee a contractor who would develop a standardized methodology that would be able to withstand a challenge in court.
The third team (Cost Documentation Team) was to develop a standard FWS cost documentation package for use in documenting all cost associated with NRDAR and spill response activities.    
Required services:The U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) requires contractor support services to provide expertise in the technical areas of cost accounting management; cost recovery; activity based costing; and development of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration (NRDAR) activities or Spill Response indirect rate to be used by the Service in its cost recovery efforts.  
The contractor will, based on background research and cost pools, develop a NRDAR indirect cost rate, under the terms and conditions of individual task orders placed. This will be one rate for all levels within the Service.  The rate will factor in analysis of cost behavior/driver analysis, and allow the Service, overall, to recover full costs.  The Contractor will perform all necessary technical analyses.  The rate must be technically and legally defensible and in full compliance with the requirements of OMB Circular A-25, OMB Circular A-34, OMB Circular A-97, 346 DM 1-4 (Cost Recovery).  The contractor will update national and/or regional policies/procedures to ensure consistent application of the NRDAR indirect cost rate.  The contractor will provide training to regional and national staff on NRDAR indirect cost rate.  Contractor will develop training materials and provide instructional materials (i.e., slides, instructor notes).
The contractor will assist the Service in the development of Service wide administrative support services quality and production measures of performance that will serve as the platform for shared administrative services across the organization.  The contractor will also provide a linkage between the Chesapeake Bay SHC model cost and performance data and the identification of employee owned skill needed to deliver the work.  In addition, the contractor will conduct a work process and cost analysis of the Region 5 internal grants submission, approval and allocation process.

This work consists of noxious weed management and treatment within the next 2 growing seasons (2008, 2009) through the use of chemical control on the Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Ketchum Ranger District specifically within known and discovered weed infestations (see maps for unit identification and site specific information). Any Idaho State listed noxious weed population found within the project area may be treated. However, in the event available funding will not allow for treatment of all known or discovered infestations, priority will be given to Idaho State listed species that are of particular local concern such as spotted knapweed, diffuse knapweed, yellow toadflax, dalmation toadflax, rush skeletonweed (potential), musk thistle, scotch thistle, and leafy spurge. Champion Creek drainage downstream of the area were straw mulch was applied (see map) shall be surveyed and treated for Idaho State listed noxious weeds and koshia.     

Additionally, a global positioning unit will be used (provided by USFS  see Section C, Government-furnished Property, if contractor does not have the ability to provide gps unit) to record areas of treatment by species. New infestations encountered will be GPSd and then treated according to the below specifications.

The contractor will provide transportation, supervision, labor, operating supplies, appropriate herbicide as specified below, dye (if desired for use), surfactant, and incidentals except those items listed in Section C, Government Furnished Property. NAICS Code: 115112. Size Standard: $6.5 million. Estimated start date: 7/30/08 with estimated completion date 9/30/08. This is 100% small business set aside.

McDermitt Health Clinic is located in the isolated Ft. McDermitt Paiute - Shoshone Indian Reservation. The reservation coupled with the local community and surrounding ranches comprise a population of 400 - 500 people. This limited number of people coupled with the lasting economic depression associated with minimal mining activity result in limited resources of any type let alone medical resources. The two nearest hospitals are located 75 miles South in Winnemucca, NV, and 191 miles North in Boise, ID. The communities located between Winnemucca and Boise are isolated. Locating providers willing to contract and travel to this isolated area are rare. IHS intends to contract, sole source, with a local Psychiatrist who has provided services for a minimum of four years. Continuity of care with the same Psychiatrist is essential to the continued and stable care offered to the patients of the Ft. McDermitt Paiute - Shoshone Tribe. Copies of the solicitation can be requested from Jim Rogers.</p>

Sharma to perform interventional radiology medical research and biomedical tissue
engineering research studies related to formulation and implementation of
animal model experiments for novel drug delivery technologies such as drug
eluting beads and imageable beads as well as thrombolytic vectors for therapy. Dr.
Sharma&rsquo;s unique skillset and training make him highly specific and uniquely
qualified to fulfill the work duties and requirements for this job.
Specifically, he is in a quite rare and scarce group with MD and PhD and
fellowship trained in Interventional Radiology at an ACGME-accedited center, as
well as being eligible for certificate of added qualifications in
Interventional Radiology from the American Board of Radiology. He has experience
with drug eluting beads as well as experience with imageable beads for
selective drug delivery and regional drug delivery to the liver. He also has
experience with electromagnetic tracking of surgical instruments and
interventiknal devices, another area of particular interest to the department.
He is one of the few individuals in the world who has experience on the study
and imaging of these iodinated beads, and the only MD PhD with expertise in
interventional oncology, thrombolysis, and imageable beads to our knowledge,
available in a timeframe and frequency conducive to meet our translational
research goals. No commercial or contracting service alternative is available
that could provide the immediate solution and set of skills without extensive
on-site training, where the training of another similar physician without his
specific expertise and skills, could even exceed the length of the contract.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Karun Sharma has become an
authority on the subject of drug eluting beads and imageable beads. He is also
one of the few individuals in the world to be familiar with the navigation
software and hardware that were jointly developed by NIH and industry over the
past few years. This skill set is also vital and unique for the success of our
ongoing research in this area. As such an expert, he provides these projects
with his experience and background that are not available on the free market
and justifies sole source. No commercial alternative is available and no
advertising could result in her combination of skill sets. He is likewise
jointly skilled in large animal research and large animal catheter manipulation
requisite for large animal research on drugs + devices to be performed Statement of Work</span></p>

<p><br />APPENDIX II</p>
<p>Executive Order 10096--Providing for a uniform patent policy for the Government with respect to inventions made by Government employees and for the administration of such policy<br />Source: The provisions of Executive Order 10096 of Jan. 23, 1950, appear at 15 FR 389, 3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp., p. 292, unless otherwise noted.<br />WHEREAS inventive advances in scientific and technological fields frequently result from governmental activities carried on by Government employees; and<br />WHEREAS the Government of the United States is expending large sums of money annually for the conduct of these activities; and<br />WHEREAS these advances constitute a vast national resource; and<br />WHEREAS it is fitting and proper that the inventive product of functions of the Government, carried out by Government employees, should be available to the Government; and<br />WHEREAS the rights of Government employees in their inventions should be recognized in appropriate instances; and<br />WHEREAS the carrying out of the policy of this order requires appropriate administrative arrangements:<br />NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes, and as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States, in the interest of the establishment and operation of a uniform patent policy for the Government with respect to inventions made by Government employees, it is hereby ordered as follows:<br />1. The following basic policy is established for all Government agencies with respect to inventions hereafter made by any Government employee:<br />(a) The Government shall obtain the entire right, title and interest in and to all inventions made by any Government employee (1) during working hours, or (2) with a contribution by the Government of facilities, equipment, materials, funds, or information, or of time or services of other Government employees on official duty, or (3) which bear a direct relation to or are made in consequence of the official duties of the inventor.<br />(b) In any case where the contribution of the Government, as measured by any one or more of the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) last above, to the invention is insufficient equitably to justify a requirement of assignment to the Government of the entire right, title and interest to such invention, or in any case where the Government has insufficient interest in an invention to obtain entire right, title and interest therein (although the Government could obtain some under paragraph (a), above), the Government agency concerned, subject to the approval of the Chairman of the Government Patents Board (provided for in paragraph 3 of this order and hereinafter referred to as the Chairman), shall leave title to such invention in the employee, subject, however, to the reservation to the Government of a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention with power to grant licenses for all governmental purposes, such reservation, in the terms thereof, to appear, where practicable, in any patent, domestic or foreign, which may issue on such invention.<br />(c) In applying the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b), above, to the facts and circumstances relating to the making of any particular invention, it shall be presumed that an invention made by an employee who is employed or assigned (i) to invent or improve or perfect any art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, (ii) to conduct or perform research, development work, or both, (iii) to supervise, direct, coordinate, or review Government financed or conducted research, development work, or both, or (iv) to act in a liaison capacity among governmental or nongovernmental agencies or individuals engaged in such work, or made by an employee included within any other category of employees specified by regulations issued pursuant to section 4(b) hereof, falls within the provisions of paragraph (a), above, and it shall be presumed that any invention made by any other employee falls within the provisions of paragraph (b), above. Either presumption may be rebutted by the facts or circumstances attendant upon the conditions under which any particular invention is made and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall not preclude a determination that the invention falls within the provisions of paragraph (d) next below.<br />(d) In any case wherein the Government neither (1) pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a) above, obtains entire right, title and interest in and to an invention nor (2) pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) above, reserves a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention with power to grant licenses for all governmental purposes, the Government shall leave the entire right, title and interest in and to the invention in the Government employee, subject to law.<br />(e) Actions taken, and rights acquired, under the foregoing provisions of this section, shall be reported to the Chairman in accordance with procedures established by him.<br />2. Subject to considerations of national security, or public health, safety, or welfare, the following basic policy is established for the collection, and dissemination to the public, of information concerning inventions resulting from Government research and development activities:<br />(a) When an invention is made under circumstances defined in paragraph 1(a) of this order giving the United States the right to title thereto, the Government agency concerned shall either prepare and file an application for patent therefore in the United States Patent Office or make a full disclosure of the invention promptly to the Chairman, who may, if he determines the Government interest so requires, cause application for patent to be filed or cause the invention to be fully disclosed by publication thereof: Provided, however, That, consistent with present practice of the Department of Agriculture, no application for patent shall, without the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture, be filed in respect of any variety of plant invented by any employee of that Department.<br />(b) [Revoked]<br />[Sec. 2(b) revoked by EO 10695 of Jan. 16, 1957, 22 FR 365, 3 CFR, 1954-1958 Comp., p. 355]<br />3.

The provisions of Executive Order 10930 are set forth below:<br />Section 1.

The required activities include pre-clinical tests and analyses, development and documentation of manufacturing processes and procedures, and collaboration to develop an IDE clinical study. The IDEs are needed so that the appropriate clinical study can be conducted to provide the evidence needed to support approval of Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) applications so that the devices may be marketed as Humanitarian Use Devices (HUDs).  

The contractors will conduct all pre-clinical testing and analysis and develop all manufacturing documentation necessary for the IDE in the first three years of the contract.  During the third year, they will develop the clinical study in partnership with a to-be-awarded Data Coordinating Center and other pre-clinical contractors, submit the IDE, and complete the necessary activities to receive FDA approval of the IDE.  Following the IDE approval, the contractors will provide regulatory, technical, and clinical support for the investigational device during the clinical study. 

Devices eligible for consideration in the PumpKIN program are limited to investigational devices that are appropriately designed and can provide suitable circulatory support for neonates, infants, and small children (<25 kg) with congenital and acquired cardiovascular disease who experience cardiopulmonary failure and circulatory collapse.  Eligible devices should be designed and developed to address the unique clinical performance issues which are relevant to this patient population. Any eligible device should be substantially developed and should have undergone and successfully demonstrated reasonable performance in a relevant animal study.

Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the Sources Sought Notice described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concerns name and address).  Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.

All capability Statements sent in response to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Stephen Crooks (Contract Specialist) and Pamela Lew (Contracting Officer), at crookss@nhlbi.nih.gov and pl116x@nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by October 10, 2008, 3:00PM, EST. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.

********************************************************************************************

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure a Multi-Function Display (MFD) System in support of PMS 500?s DDG 1000 Program.  The tasks cover design, fabrication, testing and delivery of the production representative model, as well as support for integration, installation and checkout.  Upon successful completion of developmental test, integration test and first article test the Government may exercise contract options for production and fielding of seven systems and spares.  A competitive 100% Small Business Set Aside is anticipated.
The MFD program objective is the acquisition and initial support of an integrated display that will provide three different visual cues for day and night helicopter operations on DDG 1000 class ships.  The visual cues integrated into the MFD include the flight deck status display, a horizon reference display and an Aircraft-Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) System position display.  The MFD will communicate with the Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI) Network through redundant Distributed Adaptation Processors (DAPs) to receive ship?s roll stabilization signals from NAVDDX and to update settings such as deck status and lighting intensity to accommodate a variety of meteorological and lighting conditions for flight operations.  The system will be controlled by command signals from a remote operator.  The operator interface will be a Common Electronic Display (CED) provided by the ship builder and located in the Helicopter Control Station (HCS).  Commands will be received by the MFD via the TSCEI and DAPs.  Emergency operation and maintenance capability will be provided via a hard-wired maintenance control panel provided as part of the system.  The MFD program will involve designing, building and testing a production representative system in order to achieve the objectives set forth in the DDG 1000 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and to demonstrate conformance to the MFD System Specification with the option to purchase production systems.  The MFD contract is a portion of the next generation suite of Visual Landing Aids which will be incorporated into the DDG 1000.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to the companies that respond to the FedBizOpps synopsis, as well as those companies on the solicitation mailing list.  Because the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the solicitation package is mailed.  It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 number) number and a company?s CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense.
Award will be based on a determination of ?Best Value?, which may require discussions with the offerors. The evaluation factors will be Technical, Experience, Past Performance, and Price.  Copies of DD Form 2345 and request for copies of the solicitation shall be forwarded to Mr. David Andreoli, 732-323-5208, david.andreoli@navy.mil, fax # 732-323-7440.

The principal challenges with the current statistical production process are: 1) old and complex SAS and FORTRAN coding used to generate the statistics, 2) attrition of staff who developed old SAS coding, 3) working with large volumes of administrative data, and 4) a very labor intensive process with numerous human touch points.  In addition, there are a few statistical table production processes that are generated from old and complex FORTRAN programs. 

The modernized procedures will benefit the Agency by streamlining the production process, promoting the use of consistently defined variable definitions and statistical processes, enhancing the quality of the information, and conserving labor hours required to complete this work.  By developing and implementing innovative and modernized statistical production procedures SSA will also be better prepared to serve the social insurance research and planning community with accurate custom made tables, upon request, with little effort required.

SSA is seeking vendors who are qualified in automating and modernizing statistical table production processes using the SAS Enterprise Guide platform interface to SAS (platform).  We are looking for a company that has experience completing these services for internal or external customers or has experience partnering with organizations with the required expertise.  The contractor (or partner) should have experience working with administrative data (insurance policy or claims, medical records or claims, and/or similar type data) on IBM mainframe computer environments with a z/OS operating system both in batch mode with JCL and interactively using SAS/CONNECT.  The contractor (or partner) should also have experience with SAS for Windows and SAS Enterprise Guide on PCs and Windows servers operating with SAS/CONNECT.  The contractor (or partner) should also have the ability and experience to: 1) review SSA procedures currently used to produce this information, 2) prepare data files for processing tables and develop necessary stand alone SAS programs that will produce tables suitable for publication, 3) document all modernized table production procedures, and 4) train SSA staff to implement modernized procedures.

If you believe that you have the capability to successfully deliver these services, please provide a capability statement and GSA schedule number (if applicable) to SSA.  We are also requesting that interested vendors provide information on cost models for this type of work.  Please submit your response in writing directly to Ted Horan at ted.horan@ssa.gov no later than October 10, 2008. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>1. Title: Protected Clinical Peer Review Services2. Solicitation Reference Number: VA-101-08-RP-0252 Amendment 013.  Description:  Request for Quote (RFQ) #: VA-101-08-RP-0252 is hereby amended to provide a summary of the information presented in the pre-proposal conference held October 2, 2008. Three presentations were made and are included as an Attachment to this Amendment. Vendors were also afforded the opportunity to ask questions in response to the presentations. The questions and answers are as follows:1)	VA has requested a .9 measure of agreement for inter rater reliability (IRR). Is this a percentage or is this a kappa statistic? Answer: This is a percentage.  Note, also, that VA considers a difference of 1 level to still be in agreement.  Thus, we would consider there to be a disagreement only if one reviewer assigned Level 1 and the other reviewer assigned Level 3 and vice versa. 2)	Will VA identify the type of personnel required for a multi-disciplinary review and how often will this be required? Answer:   Yes.  Note that audit reviews will generally result in the need for a single reviewer as opposed to a panel. It is anticipated that triggered reviews may necessitate multi-disciplinary review.  In this instance VA will identify the types/specialties required of the review panel.3)	In the instance where a multi-disciplinary review is required, will the Contractor be paid on a per review basis based on the number of reviewers on the panel or will the Contractor be paid one flat review rate? Answer: The Government cannot estimate the number of multi-disciplinary reviews that will take place. Contractors shall identify any assumptions made relative to pricing in the cover to its price proposal as well as any assumptions made relative to technical capability in the cover to its technical proposal.4)	Is the Low Risk background investigation (ref. page 16 of the RFP) required before Contractor access to the electronic medical record? Answer: Yes. It takes approximately 24-48 hours from receipt of a complete package for the SIC to initiate a background investigation. Once the investigation has been initiated, access can be granted.5)	Sub-factor d. for Qualifications of Peer Reviewers identified on page 66 of the RFP states "all Clinical Peer Reviewers have documentation of appropriate training and credentialing to meet National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) and Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC) standards to perform peer-to-peer interaction" Must peer reviewers meet the training and credentialing standards of both NCQA and URAC? Answer: Reviewers shall meet the training and credentialing standards of either NCQA or URAC.6)	Is all necessary data to conduct the peer review contained in the electronic medical record? Answer: The Government estimates that at least 90% of all necessary data is contained in the electronic medical record and is currently working to ensure all necessary data is included. Please note that audit reviews have already been reviewed at least twice before it is forwarded to the Contractor. As such, any information missing from the electronic medical record is generally available at that time of the review request. Additionally, VA anticipates strong communication between the Department and Contractor. This communication will assist in identifying missing information to ensure it is received by the appropriate parties.7)	If missing information is identified after receipt of the review request, does the 45 day turnaround restart? Can "cannot be determined" be provided as a rating? Answer: The Government will work to ensure the Contractor has all information necessary to conduct a review. In the event missing information is identified for which the Government does not timely provide, VA will work with the Contractor to establish a new due date. "Cannot be determined" shall not be provided as a rating.8)	What is the average size of a chart? Answer: VA utilizes an electronic medical record. As such, the actual average size/page length of a chart cannot be determined. Generally reviews are limited to a specific episode of care. As such, the review would consist of the events beginning with general admission of the patient to the discharge of the patient. 9)	On average, how long does it take to complete a review? Answer: The length of time it takes to conduct a review is wholly dependent upon the complexity of the episode of care and/or trigger for the review. As such, the length of time needed to conduct the review can and does vary. The Contractor is responsible for the length of time for each review and will not be provided any additional funding based on the actual amount of time it takes to complete the review. However for estimation purposes, for most reviews, it should take an experienced peer reviewer approximately 1 hour to review the documentation needed to complete a review. 10)	Will the Government identify the specific "trigger" that has resulted in the request for a triggered review? Answer: Yes.11)	On page 66 of the RFP, the Government requests 3 past performance references for work with the Federal Government and/or commercial customers? Can references with State agencies be provided? Also, can more than three references be provided? Answer: References for work with state agencies can be provided. Additionally, a minimum of three past performance references shall be provided; however, more than 3 references can be submitted.12)	The definition of peer according to QIO standards identifies a peer as an individual located within the same geographical region. Is this applicable to VA's definition of a peer? Answer: No. The VA holds itself to the highest standard of care regardless of geographic location. As such, a peer does not have to be located within the same geographic location.13)	How will audits be assigned? Answer: VA is willing to work with the Contractor as to the timing of the assignment of audits to ensure the Contractor has the necessary resources available to meet the review timelines.14)	Several physicians have VA appointments or are affiliated with VA in some manner. Does this represent a conflict of interest? Answer: Approximately 107 VAMCs have academic affiliations. As such it is highly likely and expected that Contractor reviewers may include physicians with VA experience or part-time appointments. The physician is not allowed to perform review services while at work performing VA duties to ensure there is no dual compensation. However, a physician operating under his/her personal time may perform reviews. The Government requests that physicians do not perform reviews for the specific facilities for which they are affiliated and expects the Contractor to ensure no personal conflicts of interest exist.  Please reference page 40 Item b. of the RFP and Section F.3 VAAR clause 852.209-70 Organizational Conflicts of Interest for more information.15)	Does the Government have historical data on the number of reviews per sub-specialty? Answer: No. At this time the Department does not track this information.

<DESC>The purpose of this solicitation is to establish a new Adjuvant Development Program to advance a novel class of vaccine adjuvants towards licensure for human use. This novel class of adjuvants stimulates the innate immune response and demonstrates strong adjuvant properties in animal models. These candidate vaccine adjuvants will be developed for human use with currently licensed or new investigational vaccine immunogens, to protect against NIAID Category A, B, or C Priority Pathogens. This initiative supports the development of candidate vaccine adjuvants through immunological characterization studies, lead compound optimization, and/or Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies, for a period not to exceed five (5) years. Work must include studies on at least one Category A, B, or C Priority Pathogen. Additional studies may be focused on other human infectious pathogens with sufficient justification of an ultimate application to Biodefense. Studies with HIV will not be supported.
