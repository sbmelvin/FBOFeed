<a href="mailto:lindsey.m.crockett2.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Natick (SPS)</a>
<DESC>*Offerors are cautioned to review the entire RFP due to revisions resulting from the Industry Day feedback.*<br><br>This requirement defines the Omnibus Program, Engineering and Technical Support (OPETS) services for the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) and all subordinate Joint Project Managers (JPMs) and their offices. This is a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (MA IDIQ) contract with, when applicable, performance based task orders for the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) and other customers under the auspices of the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP). The cumulative total of all task orders awarded to all awardees will not exceed $495,000,000 over the life of the contract. The Government anticipates that there is a strong potential for Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) to materialize over the life of the contract. Organizational conflicts of interest occur when a firm has access to nonpublic information that would give it an advantage in competing for work. Conflicts also could appear when a contractor is performing tasks that are subjective and could have a financial impact. These situations would include a company helping to prepare a statement of work and then proposing on the same project. NAICS Code 541330, Engineering Services for Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, applies with a small business size standard exception of $35,500,000. Only offerors qualifying as a small business concern under this size standard are eligible to propose for work at the task order level within the Small Business Set-Aside Acquisition Domain. Performance of this requirement may include access or exposure to private information subject to compliance to FAR Subpart 52.224-1 and 52.224-2. Performance of this requirement does include strict prohibition of dissemination of information / publishing that is subject to compliance with client requirements and data that is subject to data right restrictions by the client.

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.</strong>
<p>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of <strong>Syringe with Needle Combinations on or about February 2013, but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.</strong></p>
<p>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements.</p>
<p>Examples of items being solicited could include, but are not limited a complete line of Syringe with Needle Combinations that are sterile, single use, plastic with clear barrel hypodermic syringes with needles (Detached and Non-Detached), Safety features/device and include syringe capacities of 1mL and 3mL, and Safety Needles with outer diameters of 23, 25 and 27 Gauges and lengths of 5/8 to 1". <strong>The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $1,097,222.98 annually. </strong></p>
<p>NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.</p>
<p>Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website.</p>

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for a Phase II, NRA down select, contract to Develop a robust, low emissions combustor concept capable of meeting the LTO (landing and take-off) and cruise NOx emissions reduction goals while contributing to the achievement of the fuel burn goal without negatively impacting carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons or smoke, or particulates relative to CAEP/6 levels, at realistic N+2 engine conditions. Increased operability, stability, thermal management and performance of the combustor should be demonstrated for  100 hours in a full annular rig. NASA/GRC intends to acquire the research via a down select. The original contracts were a result of an NRA announcement, NNH10ZEA001N. The original announcement was available via full and open competition with the expectation of a down select competition amongst the awardees.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.    Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 2, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) invites scientists, technologists, and other qualified and interested individuals at U.S. institutions and elsewhere to apply for membership on the Science Definition Team (SDT) for the 2020 Mars science rover mission (hereafter Mars-2020).  Mars-2020 is a strategic mission sponsored by NASAs Planetary Science Division, through the Mars Exploration Program, all of which are part of the Science Mission Directorate (SMD).   This mission will advance the scientific priorities detailed in the National Research Councils Planetary Science Decadal Survey, entitled Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022 (the Decadal Survey is available at http://www.nap.edu ).  Mars-2020 rover development and design will be largely based upon the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) architecture that successfully carried the Curiosity rover to the Martian surface on August 6, 2012 (UTC).  The 2020 rover is intended to investigate an astrobiologically relevant ancient environment on Mars to decipher its geological processes and history, including the assessment of its past habitability and potential for preservation of biosignatures within accessible geologic materials.  Furthermore, because NASA is embarking on a long-term effort for eventual human exploration of Mars, the mission should provide an opportunity for contributed Human Exploration Mission Directorate (HEOMD) or Space Technology Program (STP) participation via payload elements aligned with their priorities and compatible with SMD priorities for Mars-2020 (e.g., MEPAG P-SAG report, posted June 2012 to MEPAG website: http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov  ). The members of the Mars-2020 SDT will provide NASA with scientific assistance and direction during preliminary concept definition (Pre-Phase A) activities. Near-term activities of the SDT will include the establishment of baseline mission science objectives and a realistic scientific concept of surface operations; development of a strawman payload/instrument suite as proof of concept; and suggestions for threshold science objectives/measurements for a preferred mission viable within resource constraints provided by NASA Headquarters.  The products developed by the SDT will be used to develop the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) that will outline the primary science objectives of the baseline mission and the character of the payload-based investigations solicited under open competition via the AO.  The SDT will be formed in January 2013, and disbanded after the work is complete approximately four months later. All reports and output materials of the Mars-2020 SDT will be publicly available, and the SDT will be disbanded prior to any future Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for participation in the Mars-2020 mission, including provision of instrumentation and investigation support.	Participation in the Mars-2020 SDT is open to all qualified and interested individuals.  The formal NASA charter for the Mars-2020 SDT will be posted to the NASA Science Mission Directorate Service and Advice for Research and Analysis (SARA) website (http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/	). DETAILS OF THIS CALL FOR SDT PARTICIPATION Response to this Call for Membership in the Mars-2020 SDT is in the form of a Letter of Application.  SDT members will be selected by NASA Headquarters senior officials from the pool of respondents and other qualified candidates. The selected members will have demonstrated expertise and knowledge in areas highly relevant to the Mars-2020 primary scientific goals and related technologies and instrumentation. The Letter of Application should provide clearly defined evidence of the candidates demonstrated expertise in one or more areas associated with the preliminary mission description given above. The Letter of Application may also contain a brief list of references to scientific or technical peer-reviewed papers the applicant has published that formally establish their position of scientific leadership in the community. The letter should also contain a statement confirming the applicants time availability during the next three to six months to participate on the SDT, particularly if there are any major schedule constraints that may restrict full engagement in the significant amount of work that will be required in a reasonably short time frame.  Applicants should indicate interest in serving as the chair or co-chair of the SDT. Membership in the SDT will be determined by NASA after formal review of the Letters of Application solicited by this Call for Membership.  Approximately 12-15 SDT members and an SDT Chair will be selected.	The NASA Mars-2020 Program Scientist, the NASA Mars Exploration Program Lead Scientist, and possibly other Agency representatives will serve as ex officio members of the SDT. Letters of Application are invited only from individuals, and group applications will not be considered.	In addition, collaborations and teams will not be considered. Each Letter of Application is limited to two pages, with 11-point font with 1-inch margins. Letters of Application submitted by E-mail are preferred, but may also be submitted by regular mail or fax.  Responses to this invitation should be received by the Mars-2020 Program Scientist no later than January 10, 2013, at the address below.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for four (4) Acumen Risk and two (2) Acumen Fuse licenses, Maintenance and Training. NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from Acumen PM, LLC. Pursuant to FAR 13.106(b)(1)(i), for the acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from one only source. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: Acumen Fuse is a metric analysis and visualization platform that assesses quality of schedules, accuracy of cost forecasts, realism of risk models, earned value and project performance. Acumen can provide both online and on-site training for Acumen Fuse and Acumen Risk. This training course covers set-up, analysis, reporting, metric development, and schedule cleansing in Fuse and Risk. Acumen Risk is an integrated cost and schedule risk analysis tool combining true cost and schedule risk analysis against a native project plan together with identified risk events from a project risk register.  Acumen Risk accounts for scope uncertainty, work complexity, risk events, and opportunities. Acumen Risk is user friendly eliminating the statistical and logical complexities of building risk models against large project schedules. The NASA KSC is currently using Acumen for programmatic analytical assessments software (e.g., review schedule maturity, track project performance trending over time, evaluate cost and schedule risk exposure, conduct earned value metric analysis, manage large, complex, multi-project models, and run internal DCMA 14 Point Assessment pre-test).  This procurement is required to continue programmatic analytical assessments currently in progress and avoid delays in fulfilling NASA KSC project requirements. It is essential to NASA Ground Systems Development Program analysis to maintain compatibility with the software currently in use. A market analysis of commercial software programs that could interface with existing software programs and meets NASAs reporting requirements were conducted. The reporting requirements include Risk Modeling, Monte Carlo, Sensitivity Analysis, Histogram reports, Tornado reports, Integrated Risk Register, Cost and Schedule analysis, and Risk Range Factors. While most software programs provide the basic requirements, Acumen Risk was the only product that meets all requirements and seamlessly interfaces with the Acumen Fuse currently using by NASA. If another program is purchased it would require additional interfaces to be developed and would require additional costs both in development, training and implementation. It is essential that NASA maintain consistency with the current software already implemented to support Agencys Independent Program audits, and which the decision points for moving into the next phase of Program development will be measured against The Government intends to acquire commercial items using FAR Part 12.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 7, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue solicitation N00024-13-R-4400 for execution of DDG 78 Extended Dry-Docking Selected Restricted Availability (EDSRA).  The availability will include a combination of collision repairs, alterations and Fleet maintenance.
 

The EDSRA shall be competed on a coast-wide basis; however, if two or more responsible offerors submit technically acceptable offers to perform the work in the Norfolk homeport area, the Government reserves the right to restrict competition to only those offers.
Based on the complexity, magnitude and duration of the requirement, the Governments market research indicates there are not two or more Small Business concerns capable of competing for the requirement as a small business set aside (FAR 19.502-2 b). 

Offerors may request a copy of the draft preliminary specification package by contacting Morgan Reese, Contracting Officer, and Traci Pichler, Contract Specialist, at morgan.reese@navy.mil and traci.pichler@navy.mil.
 The Government asks that requests for the preliminary specification package be submited via email. Any feedback should be provided to Morgan Reese and Traci Pichler at morgan.reese@navy.mil and traci.pichler@navy.mil.  The Government anticipates releasing the Request for Proposal around 15 January 2013.

The Government intends to hold an Industry Day on 9 January 2013 in Washington D.C.  Details will be provided as available via NECO and FBO.

These critical seven items are:

a)	Ladder Extension Bar P/N 9200-SLERA316N
b)	316 S/S Extension Assembly P/N 9200-SLERE316N
c)	1 Round Rung Clamp P/N 9200-SRC1000RN

f)	2 inch Offset 304 Stainless P/N 9200-SL020N
g)	0.5 inch Offset 304 Stainless P/N 9200-SL005BN 

 This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.
 The U.S. Navy has been outfitting U.S. Navy ships with ladder safety system (LSS) Kits A, B, C and manufactured by Sellstrom Manufacturing since fiscal year 2008.   Since all Navy ships will have the same Navy approved equipment; training, manuals, maintenance, user familiarity will all be the same.  The use of non-Navy approved equipment is unacceptable and dangerous. Sellstrom is the only company that manufactures this equipment that is compatible with LSS Kits A, B, C and D.

 Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.  NAICS Code 332999   applies. FSC 4240 . Size Standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The United States Government seeks to lease office and related support space consisting of approximately 10,900 rentable square feet of office and warehouse space and 1.6 acres of wareyard space in Las Vegas, Nevada. The space should yield a minimum of 10,900 ANSI/BOMA square feet (minimum 900 ABOA office and 10,000 warehouse). The office, warehouse and wareyard space shall be contiguous (the office must be inside the office/warehouse building and the wareyard must be immediately contiguous to the office/warehouse building). <br /><br />The warehouse space offered must have a minimum ceiling clear height of 16'. The space offered must be modifiable to install windows in the exterior walls to provide natural light for the office area and to install roll up doors with a minimum dimension of 14'H x 12"W. The wareyard area must be securable via a fence and adequate lighting. An up-to-date Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment will be required. <br /><br />The proposed space must be located within the following delineated area and must have the following characteristics: <br /><strong><br />North</strong>: Sahara Avenue;<br /><strong>South</strong>: South Hollywood Boulevard, Pabco Road, Warm Springs Road;<br /><strong>East</strong>: Blue Diamond (Rainbow to I15), St Rose Parkway (I15 to 215), 215/564 (564 to Warm Springs Road);<br /><strong>West</strong>: South Rainbow Boulevard.<br /><br />The space should be located in areas similar in nature to an industrial area which is open and has a low population density. Because the agency uses very large vehicles to perform their mission, the space cannot be located in high traffic areas to ensure agency vehicles have adequate turning radius' (are able to exit onto streets and roads in a timely manner without waiting long periods for other vehicles to clear) and are not creating traffic disturbances (blocking traffic). Spaces which are located in areas with easy access to large thoroughfares are preferred.<br /><br />Fully serviced leases are sought. All services, supplies, utilities and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration. The offered space must meet the Governments requirements for Fire, Life-safety, and Handicapped Accessibility. <br /><br />Property located within a base floodplain (100 year floodplain) or wetland will not be considered. <br /><br />The term of the proposed lease is ten (10) years, five (5) years firm. Occupancy is required on or before July 31, 2012. <br /><br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:<br />Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing and should include the following information at minimum (This is not an invitation for bids or a request for proposals):
<p>&bull; Building name/address<br />&bull; Legal property description, recent survey, and property identification numbers (PIN).<br />&bull; Location of space in the building and date it will be available.<br />&bull; One-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered and Site Plan..<br />&bull; ANSI/BOMA defined office area/useable square feet (USF).<br />&bull; Rentable Square Feet (RSF) offered and rental rate per square foot, specifying services, utilities, and tenant improvement allowance included.<br />&bull; Common Area Factor used to determine the RSF.<br />&bull; Name, address, telephone number, and email address of authorized contact.<br />&bull; In cases where an agent is representing multiple ownership entities, written acknowledgement, and permission to represent multiple owners for the same submission</p>
<p>AUTHORIZED CONTACTS:<br />GSA is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in lease negotiations for this transaction. In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized officers and employees of the General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative CBRE, Inc.<br /><br />Interested parties should submit pertinent information to the tenant broker and the GSA Contracting Officer:</p>

This Sources Sought notice is for market research purposes in determining interest and capability of potential small business vendors for this type of requirement only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of supplies or services. This notice does not constitute a solicitation (e.g. Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. All costs associated with responding to this notice are solely at the responding party's expense.
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The BEP will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this notice. Responses to the notice will not be returned.

<p>II. PURPOSE: The Bureau of Engraving &amp; Printing (BEP) has initiated an effort to provide blind and visually impaired individuals one or more means of denominating U.S. banknotes.</p>
<p>The BEP conducted a comprehensive study of the technical, social and economic factors involved and formulated a multi-faceted approach to providing blind and visually impaired individuals 'meaningful access' to U.S. banknotes. One approach includes developing a tactile&bull; feature that can be incorporated into the design of U.S. banknotes which can provide a means of denominating the banknotes through touch or feel. The Office of Product Development (OPD) within the BEP has been tasked with managing this approach.</p>
<p>In order to fully investigate and evaluate the effectiveness of various styles, types and patterns of tactile elements that could potentially be incorporated into U.S. banknotes, the BEP/OPD is interested in issuing Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to obtain specific expertise and experience in the field of tactile perception and acuity studies. Under the BPA, task order(s) shall be issued including specific requirements, timelines and deliverables for each study requested. This expertise is essential for designing, developing and conducting a tactile feature testing program. The studies will provide accurate and sufficient data to assist the BEP in developing the most effective and efficient tactile feature design and pattern that will be most helpful to blind and visually impaired individuals in denominating U.S. banknotes.</p>
<p>In support of this effort, the BEP shall contract with subject matter experts in the field of blindness and haptic perception to administer studies to determine the relative effectiveness of the proposed tactile elements for incorporation into U.S. banknotes for denominating U.S. currency using the sense of touch. The objective of the studies/tests will be to measure the accuracy and speeds of denominating by the trial participants. The data from these trials will be used by the BEP to help select from among the options the tactile feature that is most accurate and quickest for blind and visually impaired individuals.</p>
<p>III. Submission Requirements: Responses to the notice shall include the following:</p>
<p>a. Company Information and Point of Contact ("POC"):<br />&bull; Company's Name<br />&bull; Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code<br />&bull; Contact information for identified POC, including e-mail, telephone number and facsimile number.</p>
<p>b. Capability Information: Service/Capability Literature and other supporting documentation that demonstrates your company's ability and certification to provide the subject services and supplies.</p>
<p>IV: DUE DATE: Responses to this notice are due no later than 1:00 P.M. Eastern Time, January 7, 2013 and shall be sent via e-mail to the attention of individual listed above.</p>

<DESC>A Concession Business Opportunity for Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail and Other Services at Peaks of Otter with an Option to Include Operations at Otter Creek or Doughton Park or Both within the Blue Ridge Parkway
On April 26, 2012, the National Park Service (NPS) issued a prospectus for solicitation of offers for a 10-year concession contract to provide for Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail and Other Services at Peaks of Otter, Rocky Knob, and Doughton Park within the Blue Ridge Parkway.  The initial due date for proposals was July 27, 2012.  
The Service has revised the Prospectus to improve the opportunity for potential offerors, including reducing the Leasehold Surrender Interest buy-in, replacing the Rocky Knob location with the Otter Creek location and removing requirements to operate locations other than Peaks of Otter. See the Business Opportunity for more information. Peaks of Otter has been a tourist destination since the early 1800s and continues to this day to be a major terminus along the Parkway.  The Peaks of Otter recreation area, centered at Milepost 86, includes about 4,100 acres of mostly hardwood forest.  The Concession Opportunity comprises several services at Peaks of Otter, including the three-building, 63 room lodge overlooking Abbott Lake and Sharp Top Mountain, the restaurant, lounge and gift shop, the Country Store located adjacent to the visitor contact station and a shuttle bus servicing the top of Sharp Top Mountain.
Solicitation #CC-BLRI011-13 includes information for the Otter Creek and Doughton Park operations.  The Otter Creek and Doughton Park operations are not required in this prospectus. The Offeror has the option to include the required services at Doughton Park or Otter Creek or both in the Draft Contract. See the Proposal Package (Part III of the Prospectus) for more information.  
All offers must be received by the NPS at the address listed on the inside front cover of the prospectus no later than 4:00 p.m. on February 6, 2013 in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract.  The prospectus describes the business opportunity and includes the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract. 
The prospectus will be available on the NPS website at http://concessions.nps.gov/prospectuses.htm, or you can receive a hard copy for $50.00.  To request a hard copy of the prospectus to be delivered via Federal Express, send a check for $50.00 payable to the National Park Service to Mark Morgan at the address listed below.  Please include a physical address (no post office box) and telephone number.  You may also pick up a printed copy at the Superintendents Office at Park Headquarters for $45.00 (checks only).  
If you are planning to submit a proposal and have obtained your prospectus from the website, we recommend that you advise Mark Morgan, Concessions Management Specialist, Southeast Region, NPS, AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street, S.W., Atlanta, GA  30303 at (404) 507-5638 or e-mail at Mark_Morgan@nps.gov of your interest so your contact information can be placed on a mailing list to receive future responses to questions or amendments to the prospectus.  Those receiving a hard copy or who are on the mailing list will be provided with any additional information specific to the prospectus in writing.  The same information is posted to the above mentioned website.  Questions in response to this prospectus are due in writing by Wednesday January 2, 2013, to the address listed on the inside front cover of the prospectus or by email to Mark Morgan.

<CONTACT>Linda Applewhite, Phone 571-272-2256, Email Linda.Applewhite@uspto.gov
<DESC><strong>Title:</strong>
<p>Domain Name System (DNS) Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) IP Address Management (IPAM) also known as DNS/DHCP/IPAM (DDI) Equipment</p>
<p><strong>Background/ Purpose:</strong></p>
<p>DNS is a system for naming computers and network services that is organized into a hierarchy of domains. DNS naming is used in TCP/IP networks, such as the Internet, to locate computers and services with user-friendly names. When a user enters a DNS name in an application, DNS services can resolve the name to other information that is associated with the name, such as an IP address.</p>
<p>Currently a high number of duplicate IP addresses on the USPTO network have negatively impacted services over the network. Because of this negative impact, an automated solution is being sought.</p>
<p>The DNS Server role provides the following:</p>
<p>&bull; A Request for Comments (RFC)-compliant DNS server<br />&bull; DNS is an open protocol. It is standardized by a set of RFCs. Microsoft supports and complies with these standard specifications.<br />&bull; Interoperability with other DNS server implementations <br />&bull; Support for Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)</p>
<p>The goal of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research to explore the technical aspects of the available products to meet this requirement. The Government is seeking industry input to assist in identifying features and solutions to meet the requirements described below. To support such an effort, the USPTO is also interested in evaluating, at no-cost, available products for an automated solution. Please note that the Government will <strong>NOT</strong> be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties responding to this RFI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY</span>. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>The DNS system solution will be evaluated based on whether it meets the criteria and requirements noted on the attached document.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>In response to this RFI, respondents shall submit written responses, not-to-exceed ten (10) pages in length via electronic mail. Product specification, sketches, or listings of authorized distributors are not to count as part of the page count. If the respondent's product is available for test or evaluation purposes, please indicate such availability in the written response. As stated elsewhere in this RFI, the availability, testing, and evaluation of any product shall be conducted at no cost to the Government. The Government is interested in receiving vendors' commercial published price lists for items they believe meet the need in this RFI. Supplying price data does not imply a contractual obligation and must be provided as a separate document, marked as PRICE DATA, and sent only to the primary point of contact identified below.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to pay for the information solicited. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. The Government will not release any information about your approach that might in any way compromise your competitive posture or proprietary information. The Government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.</p>
<p>Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future associated RFP/RFQ that may be issued. Information provided in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website: www.fbo.gov. It is the potential vendor's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.</p>
<p>Responses, including the availability of products for evaluation purposes, shall be conducted at no cost to the Government. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement. Telephone calls requesting a solicitation will not be accepted or acknowledged. Responses to this RFI are voluntary and their source shall be treated as confidential.</p>
<p><strong>How to Respond:</strong></p>
<p>Please submit your response to this RFI (not to exceed 10 pages) via email to Linda.Applewhite@uspto.gov no later than 4:00 PM E.S.T Monday, January 7th, 2013. Please include <strong>RFI PROC1300085</strong> on any correspondence.</p>

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all information received within fifteen days (15) after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District intends to specify the following manufacturers product in the Joint Special Operations University (JSOU), MacDill AFB, FL project in order to properly manage the high density customer work spaces required by USSOCOM-J6 in its new data center. USSOCOM requires a specified brand name, firm fixed price purchase order for; modular furniture from Haworth Modular Office furniture. <br>  <br> This project will include constructing a multi-story facility with precast concrete exterior wall panels.  Project includes site improvements, landscaping, communications and anti-terrorism/force protection.  Construction consists of concrete pile foundation, structural steel framing, reinforced concrete slab, fire protection, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, security system, assured telecomm architecture, HVAC and built up roof. <br> The US Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has experienced unprecedented growth since September 11, 2001.  The SOCOM compound has expanded with new buildings and routinely reorganizes to accommodate the evolving mission. Therefore, USSOCOM maintains an inventory of spare parts in order to rapidly accomplish frequent office reconfigurations as required.  Maintaining multiple types of inventories of systems furniture would create an additional space requirement as well as an increased administrative burden and cost.   <br>  <br> USSOCOM also provides support to two local subordinate (component) commands.  They also use Haworth as the standard cubical furniture.  SOCOM's modular work stations' IT and electrical requirements were factored into the ultimate decision to utilize Haworth as the sole provider of modular workstations.   <br>  <br> Firms interested in being considered shall provide manufactures name, product data and written statement of compatibility.  The written statement of compatibility shall include manufacturer backup information and support documentation.   Responses must be received fifteen (15) days after publication of this notice.

USSOCOM requires a specified brand name, firm fixed price purchase order for; modular furniture from Kimball Modular Office furniture. <br> USSOCOM  Memorandum For Distribution A, Subject: United Stated Special Operations Command Standard for Furniture dated May 12 2009 identified Kimball Modular Office Furniture as the standard for the senior executive suites.   <br> Factors leading to Kimball's selection included its executive style veneer as well as the modular system of assembly, allowing for multiple types of reconfigurations. The  quote mark executive modular suite quote mark  sets provide the basic structure for all General and Flag offices, all Senior Executive Service personnel, their respective outer offices and J-code center directors and division chiefs.    <br> SOCOM's facilities office relocates or modifies executive suites on a monthly basis. Standardized furniture allows for suites to be modified while ensuring all the pieces will connect and match.  If another brand of executive modular furniture were purchased and introduced into the command, SOCOM could frequently be forced to replace multiple existing Kimball executive suite sets in order to effect the modification of an existing office due to different sizes of modular pieces and different finishes.  The additional disruptions to the executive work force to replace an entire office instead of one or two desks would cause interruptions that would not otherwise be required.  <br> Kimball was also designated as the standard executive furniture for installation in two new buildings just recently completed. As a result USSOCOM will end up with over 300 Kimball executive offices and modular cubicles worth approximately $1.5 MIL. <br> Firms interested in being considered shall provide manufactures name, product data and written statement of compatibility.  The written statement of compatibility shall include manufacturer backup information and support documentation.   Responses must be received fifteen (15) days after publication of this notice.   Responses should be addressed to:  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, ATTN:  Rosemary Hall:  CESAM-CT-C, P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL  36628-0001, faxed to 251-441-6510 ATTN:  Rosemary Hall or emailed to Rosemary.C.Hall@usace.army.mil <br>  <br>  <br>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a Sources Sought Announcement for a maintenance dredging and rock removal project located in the Portland Harbor, Maine.  This announcement is to determine the interest, availability, and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Small Business concerns as described below.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990.  The project is planned to be issued on or about April 2013.  The construction will occur in the fall-winter of 2013-14 and is expected to take several months.  The estimated construction cost is between $10 Million and $12 Million. <br> The work of this project consists of mechanically dredging the 35-foot channel.  About 700,000 cubic yards of sediment will be removed.  In addition, there are five rock pinnacles protruding above the -35 foot mean lower low water (MLLW) plane.  These rock pinnacles, totaling about 1,500 cubic yards, will be removed - presumably by drilling and blasting.  Diving support will be required.  Submarine utilities are present in the Harbor.  Lobster relocation will be conducted by a non-Federal sponsor prior to dredging, requiring close coordination with all parties.  Disposal will be in open water at the Portland Disposal Site, approximately 10 miles away.  Anticipated work window is around November 1 2013 to March 15 2014.  Because of the environmental and fisheries concerns and conditions, dredging and rock removal must be done in a particular, sequential manner, and therefore it is expected that the entire work window will be needed.  Work will be allowed 24 hours per day.  Portland Harbor is a busy commercial harbor, and dredging must not interfere with ship traffic. <br> Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) as well as what type of equipment the firm is proposing to use.  Additionally, firms should submit the types of prior experience they have.  This experience must have been performed within the last five years.  Responses are due by 10 January, 2013.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN: Kimberly B. Pumyea Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Interested firms shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.

<DESC><br />Sources Sought:<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for a Market Research ONLY to determine the availability of potential small business firms for a potential small business category type set-aside. NO AWARD will be made from this Sources Sought. NO SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; therefore, do NOT request a copy of a solicitation. Potential Offerors having the skill, capabilities and bonding necessary to perform the described project are invited to provide feedback via email to Healon.D.Knight@usace.army.mil. All responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a potential future acquisition.
<p>Particularly, the purpose of this NOTICE is to gain knowledge of potential small business sources in the following categories: Certified 8a, Certified HUB Zone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), to provide the necessary traffic counters to the Government. The capabilities will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining to Set-Aside for the Small Business Community or to conduct as an Unrestricted Procurement. Other than small businesses may respond to this NOTICE in the event the market does not indicate SB interest, however, preference will be given to the SB categories listed above. The government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of available Kntrs.</p>
<p>NAICS Code:<br />The proposed NAICS code for this potential procurement is 334519 - Other Measuring &amp; Controlling Device Manufacturing/500 Employees.</p>
<p>Contract Activities:<br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District Civil Works Water Resource Development Projects has an upcoming project entitled, "Traffic Counters for Various USACE-SPK Parks and Lakes, California." The primary objective of this SOURCES SOUGHT notice is to identify businesses capable of providing the necessary supplies to the Government.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation. This is a merely a request for information. Do not call the Contract Specialist or the Contracting Officer, a solicitation is not being issued at this time.</p>
<p>Salient Characteristics:<br />The Government requires traffic counting devices which will be placed the roadway(s). The geographic location is the remote foothills of the Western slope of the Sierra Nevada's in California. Weather conditions vary from 20 degree F to 110 degree F. If counters are installed above ground, they will be exposed to all weather conditions and temperature ranges. If counters are installed below ground, they will be placed in rocky, to semi-rocky, to clay-like soils. If installed below ground, traffic counters will still be exposed to any naturally occurring precipitation events. The integrity of the equipment proposed will be maintained at least to these environmental conditions and may be designed for more extreme environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Traffic counting devices must have flexible mounting options. The equipment may be installed above ground or below ground. It shall be capable of being fastened to metal, wooden or hybrid plastic poles. The vendor should expect that their proposed equipment, if installed above ground, will be placed in some type of weather proof housing, examples of a weatherproof housing may include: Pelican case, Otter box, or generic fiberglass housing. Therefore, the counters must be stand-alone and self-contained. The counters must not have any external wires or tubes. The vendor must demonstrate the ability of the equipment to operate from within these types of enclosures.</p>
<p>The traffic counters are expected to count single lanes, dual lanes, or may need to count single lanes for a portion of any given year and dual lanes for another portion of any given year. Lanes of traffic may be on concrete, asphalt, decomposed granite or native soil roadways. Lanes of traffic may be level, or up to 7% grade. The vendor will demonstrate the ability of the proposed equipment to accurately count vehicles in at least these conditions.</p>
<p>The vendor's equipment will have a numeric readout with at least a 6-digit LCD tally display. This display must be easily calibrated and reset by the end user as necessary. The display will be an inherent component of the meter and must be incorporated into the stand alone design. The display must be easily read in inclement weather and lighting. The readout must be easily read without having to open the weatherproof housing.</p>
<p>The vendor should assume that the counters will be installed in locations where no permanent source of electrical energy is available. The preferred device will operate in an efficient manner so as to prolong the life of the power source inherent to the device. The efficiency of the device will be maximized so as to reduce to the greatest extent possible the frequency of battery replacement. The power source will be a common type of battery. The battery or batteries supplied will be small in physical size with consideration to the overall size and weight of the entire unit. Therefore, preferred designs will use alkaline C-cell battery power.</p>
<p>Meters must be no greater than 11cm wide by 15 cm long by 3 cm high, inclusive of the numeric read out LCD display. Meters will be installed in vandalism prone areas and vendors will consider the impact vandalism and visitor abuse may have to the equipment. The preferred product should lend itself to an inconspicuous installation.</p>
<p>Maintenance requirements will be kept to a minimum. The number of moving and/or serviceable parts should be kept to a minimum. The preferred product will have a "set-it" and "forget-it" build. There will be no special tools required for installation or maintenance.</p>
<p>The counters will arrive ready for installation and will be preprogrammed from the vendor to count automotive vehicles.</p>
<p>The data collected by the counters will be transferable to a computer. Either a docking device and/or cable will be included and may be either part of the device or may be a separate component. The end result being that the Government shall be able to download or access the data collected by the device via computer for future use in studies or metric analysis.</p>
<p>Capabilities Statement:<br />The following requests are designed to apprise the US Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, of any prospective Kntrs who have the capabilities associated with this work requirement. Please provide your response to the following. The submission is limited to 20 pages, cut-sheets are allowable.</p>

Coast Guard needs personnel properly trained in maintaining newly installed Avionics 1 Upgrade (A1U) aircraft equipment. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) seeks a contractor to develop a detailed hands on A1U maintenance troubleshooting training curriculum complete with troubleshooting instruction down to the A1U Line Replaceable Units (LRU)s for the USCG's Fleet of HC-130H aircraft. This effort requires the Contractor to develop a maintainer course for training USCG Fleet maintenance personnel for all newly installed A1U systems equipment to include training and use of maintenance procedure cards (MPCs). The maintainer course shall be developed in accordance with the guidelines specified in the USCG Training System SOPs.</p>
<p>The contractor's course shall include but shall not be limited to, overviews of installed A1U equipment; troubleshooting instruction of all A1U systems equipment to the LRU level; fault Isolation procedures; safety requirements, scheduled maintenance training; and operational performance checks for A1U systems equipment.

In order to support the healthcare providers and patients alike, ACA magazines/materials outline experience in providing the required educational training/support materials.  Also, the approaches outlined in the magazine will enable VHA to move from a 'disease model' of care into a patient centered 'wellness model'. This approach is also critical in order to provide better amputation care to VHA's foreseeable influx of amputee veterans seeking VHA healthcare.  The system that is incorporated in ACA's materials will place VA in a unique position of being the best approach to assist VA and its patients in improved "amputation of care".

In addition, VHA requires annual ACA/CARF membership for 22 VISN as well as 7 Regional Amputation Centers (RACs) and 15 Polytrauma Amputation Networks (PANS).   EES requires access to ACA/CARF corporate membership in order to support VHA's ongoing research for clinical training and education management decisions that directly impacts our nation's veterans quality of healthcare.

<RESPDATE>011713
<CONTACT>Charles Littleton, Contracting Officer, Email charles.littleton@cms.hhs.gov - Scott D. Yeager, Contract Specialist, Email scott.yeager@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is issuing this Request for Information as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support the contract entitled "Research Data Assistance Center (ResDAC)." The purpose of the ResDAC is to assist the CMS to increase the number of researchers skilled in accessing and using CMS data for studies which may improve the Medicare and Medicaid programs and add value to current CMS activities. This contract will require:
<p>1. expertise in advanced research and statistical methodology sufficient to assist all levels of researchers (from students to internationally reknown experts) who may or may not be familiar with the data available at CMS and its use;</p>
<p>2. nationally recognized CMS data experts who describe the data, comment on its applicability to the proposed research, and help researchers with the process of gaining an approved Data Use Agreement;<br /><br />3. detailed comprehensive, expert knowledge of CMS's data release policies and procedures; and,</p>
<p>4. the ability to provide CMS with detailed, integrated, synergistic, comprehensive, and enterprise-wide recommendations on how to improve the current data request process.</p>
<p>Technical Expertise w/ CMS Data - In the course of operating its programs, CMS maintains and utilizes a vast array of data. These data provide information on eligibility/enrollment, Medicare and Medicaid providers, claims and utilization, program regulations, and clinical assessment information that support program oversight, research and evaluation purposes. CMS data are not always easy to use, even for researchers experienced with administrative databases. Furthermore, researchers are not always aware of what data are available, when updates take place, the applicability of specific data elements, the implications of CMS program changes on data consistency, and techniques for linking CMS data with data from other sources. In the ensuing years, it has become more difficult for even frequent users of CMS data to use the current files being released. For these reasons, CMS requires the expertise and services of highly qualified personnel. ResDAC's technical staff are expected to have knowledge and expertise with CMS data and must also be knowledgeable in conducting complex health services research using CMS data. This intellectual capital will be used in educating researchers (including CMS staff and contractors), critiquing research, and understanding the appropriate level of specificity needed when preparing data requests. The nature of these tasks will require multi-disciplinary skills including but not limited to; epidemiology, health economics, public health, statistics and biostatistics, health care, health services research and research design methodology. The technical staff should be expert researchers and be well renowned in these fields. The contractors must demonstrate how they are distinguished in their fields (i.e. they have been invited to speak at national health conferences, have published papers, etc.) and have in-depth technical expertise on CMS data, including all other attributes surrounding the data (i.e. release cycles, data anomalies, data sources, etc.)<br />Technical Expertise w/ CMS Data Release Policies and Procedures - ResDAC will provide assistance to researchers in understanding the Medicare/Medicaid data acquisition process and how to obtain an approved Data Use Agreement. CMS research support involves collaboration with outside researchers. Researchers in the health services arena are affiliated with other government agencies and commissions (both Federal and State), the academic community (schools of medicine, public health, public policy, and economics), non-profit organizations, private consultants (for-profit health research organizations), other private sector health services providers (hospitals and Medicare Advantage plans), and the Qualified Entities (QEs) in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) program. The contractor will need to have in-depth knowledge of CMS' data release policies as they apply to each of these differing organizations and fully understand the statutory authority for data release allowable to each type of organization. Listed below are subject areas relating to the CMS data release policies and procedures that the contractor is required to have expertise and knowledge of:</p>
<p>&#61656; Laws and regulations governing privacy and data security. The ResDAC contractor shall educate and train CMS staff, contractors, and researchers on how to apply the CMS minimum data necessary policies and other requirements in the following, where applicable:<br />&nbsp; &bull; Privacy Act of 1974<br />&nbsp; &bull; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule<br />&nbsp; &bull; HIPAA Security Rule<br />&nbsp; &bull; Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA)<br />&nbsp; &bull; Office Management and Budget Circular A-130</p>

<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>
<DESC>This notice provides details from the Limited Source Justification approved in support of a 90-day extension of DE-AT01-07IN30111 with Delta Research Associates Inc.
I. IDENTIFICATION OF AGENCY/CONTRACTING ACTIVITY
The Department of Energy?s (DOE), Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence (IN) plans to extend the task order, DE-AT01-07IN30111, awarded to Delta Research Associates, Inc. (DRA) by means of this Limited Sources Justification via the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6. The Office of Headquarters Procurement Services (MA-64) will execute this action.
II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED
This action is to extend the task order currently being performed by DRA for a period of three months (from January 13, 2013 to April 12, 2013) to provide mission critical support associated with the IN program. An interruption to the services currently being provided would compromise the protection of the United States against threats posed by nuclear proliferation and terrorism.  As such, DRA currently provides the mission critical support services to DOE-IN assisting the office with the creation and making available to appropriate Federal departments and agencies an integrated system of information from all sources concerning worldwide nuclear material holdings and their security status. 
The purpose of this justification is to extend the period of performance to April 12, 2013 and increase the ceiling of the task order as a Limited Sources Justification pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(1) to continue the support without a break in service.    The extension of the period of performance of this task order will not require any change to the Statement of Work; however it will require an increase in the level of effort to continue the support. The award of the task order was completed in accordance with Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures in FAR 8.405-2.
III. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY?S NEEDS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED VALUE
This requirement is to ensure that there is no break in service or potential mission impact.  The services being acquired during this extension period are consistent with the work DRA currently is performing under task order DE-AT01-07IN30111. The scope of this effort supports the continued success of IN?s efforts to provide timely and actionable strategic intelligence analysis; ensure intelligence security throughout the DOE complex; and cultivate and encourage the intelligence capabilities and contributions of DOE's technical, analytical, and research expertise is applied to the nation's most difficult technical intelligence challenges.  
The task order support includes the following:  technical and analytical services in the areas of counterintelligence, foreign risk management, science and technology, collections and proliferation.
IV. RATIONAL FOR LIMITED SOURCES AND UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR
FAR 8.405-6 requires an ordering activity to justify its actions when restricting competition of schedule contractors under FAR 8.405-2. The specific circumstance justifying the restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C), which allows for limiting sources when in the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original FSS order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable FSS ordering procedures.
This extension is a logical follow-on to the original FSS order, task order DE-AT01-07IN30111, which was awarded in accordance with applicable FSS ordering practices. The original task order was issued in accordance with the applicable FSS ordering procedures and was not issued under sole source or limited source procedures in place under FAR 8.4 at the time of award. This task order extension is a logical follow-on, as it will not change the scope of work being performed by DRA. Moreover, the work to be performed during the extension period is a continuation of the services already being provided by DRA.
An interruption to services provided under this task order would create substantial risk to IN?s mission. DRA has provided critical support to IN over the past five years and the extension is necessary in order to not compromise the United States against threats posed by nuclear proliferation, terrorism and cyber operations.  This task order extension allows the Government to maintain the current level of expertise and support without a break in service.  
The nature of this acquisition is such that the current task order will expire on January 12, 2013 and the award of a new competitive task order is not anticipated prior to this expiration date. This extension is necessary to provide the required continuity of services for achievement of IN?s mission objectives without interruption while DOE continues its efforts to award a new task order.  It is recommended that the period of the task order be extended to April 12, 2013.
V. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ACTION REPRESENTS BEST VALUE TO THE GOVERNMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 8.404(d).
DRA is in a unique position to continue support of IN without an interruption in service. The initial task order requirement was issued competitively in April 2007.  DRA?s performance has been satisfactory in meeting all of their performance requirements. Furthermore, DRA has maintained discounts on their GSA Schedule labor rates throughout the period of performance. Based on DRA?s initial proposal for this task order, their contract performance, the providing of discounted rates, the importance of continuity of services, and the strong qualifications discussed above, this short-term (3 months) extension of this task order represents ?Best Value? to the Government. 
Based on DRA?s successful performance over the past five years and the measurable contribution to IN?s mission goals that the contractor has achieved; a short term extension to DRA is in the best interest of the Government. 
VI. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY (OR STATEMENT OF REASONS NO SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED)
Market research was not conducted for this requirement because this requirement is to ensure that there is continuity of services.
VII. OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
No other facts supporting use of limited sources have been identified beyond those documented in this Limited Sources Justification. 
VII.  ACTION THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME BARRIERS WHICH LED TO RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS.
There will not be any barriers that will lead to restricted competition as the successor to this task order was based on a competitive process. The circumstances resulting in the need for restricted competition for this 3 month period are temporary and should not be a factor in future competitions.

Countries: Passport also contains more than one million economic data points (GDP, disposable income, FDI, inflation, etc.) spanning 205 countries, as well as demographic and marketing statistics, agriculture production and farming data, 200+ country report profiles (political risk, economic outlook and forecast information, prospects for economic growth, business environment analysis, etc.), and reports assessing late-breaking economic and market conditions impacting business that can support or hinder US exports and export opportunities. Consumers: The subscription also includes access to 100+ page Consumer Lifestyle Reports for 74 countries and detailed datasets for 205 countries covering population, household structures, income and expenditure patterns, labor, health and health/wellness trends, smoking/eating/drinking preferences, education, transportation, leisure and recreation habits, and other factors to understand specific consumer groups in each country and what US products they want and can afford. Companies: Passport provides 3,309 company profiles, documenting contact information, market strategies, marketing activities and lists leading retailers that represent potential oversees export partners, distributors, buyers, and competitors in the marketplace. 

This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b), only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sole Sourne Notice of Intent<br /></span></strong>This notice is NOT a solicitation. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Background:</strong> <br />The NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) has a requirement to renew the membership to the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) Executive Board for the calendar year 2013, and two additional option years (2014 and 2015).<br /><strong><br />Synopsis:<br /></strong>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), intends to negotiate with the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI); Washington, DC, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302, to provide the purchase/renewal of NIST's Executive Membership to the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS), including Executive Board Special Assessment for funding the next US hosted JTC 1 Plenary.&nbsp;<br /><br />The period of performance of this planned requirement is expected to be for a base period of one year, followed by two option periods of one year each.  The period of performance is expected to begin on January 1, 2013.<br /><br />This requirement is based on the fact that INCITS is the US Technical Advisory Group for ISO/IEC JTC 1 on Information Technology.  Membership on JTC 1 is restricted to National Bodies and Liaison organizations.  Liaison members are required to be multinational in nature.  As a USG agency, the only way that NIST can participate in JTC 1 is through the unique US National Body member, which is the INCITS Executive Board.<br /><br />Participation in the activities of INCITS at its consensus body level, the Executive Board, and access to all of the INCITS level documents requires membership on the INCITS Executive Board. The INCITS Executive Board has sole oversight of its 21 Technical Committees.  JTC 1 has sole oversight of its twenty two Subcommittees/Working Groups.  That body of work is a significant part of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) standardization critical to NIST ITL programs.  Those facts drive NIST's membership on INCITS, and its predecessor organizations, since 1962.  NIST/ITL is a member of other standards development organizations in the ICT space including IEEE, Internet Engineering Task Force, Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise, International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector, and Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Systems, among others.<br /><br />Membership on the INCITS Executive Board provides the NIST ITL with an opportunity to identify issues which could impact its program of work in Information Technology (IT) standardization and testing. Without staying informed of current and future issues in this field that are being undertaken by INCITS and JTC 1, the NIST ITL's programs could be hindered, affecting the overall mission of the division. Participation in this activity also enables NIST ITL to enhance its ability to influence the timely development of national and international IT standards, which are consistent with U.S. Government and industry goals.<br /><br />The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) is the Secretariat for INCITS. ITI is therefore solely and uniquely qualified to collect INCITS Executive Board membership fees.  ITI does not have any authorized agents or resellers.
<p>The anticipated NAICS Code for this requirement is 813910 with a Size Standard of $7.0 million.  NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Information Technology Industry Council, Inc. for this requirement.<br /><br />Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST and are authorized to provide these services may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before <strong>December 27, 2012 at 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time</strong>. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Keith Bubar at <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">keith.bubar@nist.gov </span></strong>.</p>

<DESC>Industry Day Questions 12/11/2012

1)	 Will the RFP specify an integration facility (location, size, capabilities)?  If so, at what point in the contract does the government anticipate requiring the Offeror to have the facility up and running?
Answer:  As this is an integration contract, an integration facility is a requirement.  Specifics of the facility will be proposed in Offerors proposals.  This facility will be required to be up and running in time to meet development, integration and certification of software and hardware in order to meet the Fleet installation schedule.

2)	Will OMS signal processing and display be performed in CAC hardware?
Answer:  OMS boundaries are defined as the physical input to the analog telemetry acquisition units, ships cabling, and current hardware footprints.
  OMS software is intended to be reconfigurable and can run in multiple AN/BQQ-10 cabinets, including the CAC.  The processed information will be displayed on the ECDWS, the Engine Room Display (ERD) and the Dive Officer of the Watch (DOOW) display.

3)	When will the Technical Information Center (TIC) in Newport be open?
Answer:   There will be separate TICs for each of the three contracts.  Access to each TIC will be made available when the applicable draft RFP is released.

4)	Slide 18 shows a TBD integrator on lower right and a central box labeled Sonar Integration.  Can you allocate proposed contracts to these two integration roles?
Answer:   Please note the label on the left side of the slide, TBD Industry Partners. Because these procurements are competitive, the Navy cannot name successful Offerors without having conducted the competition.
  The TBD Integrator will be the winner of the A-RCI Integration competitive procurement.  This Offeror will be responsible for the software development of the strings identified (SA, HFP, etc.) as well as ensuring test and certification of the entire ARCI system.  Many other partners contribute hardware and software to this effort, as indicated by the arrows pointing to the Sonar Integration box.  It is the responsibility of the TBD integrator to work with all of those partners to develop and certify the full system.

5)	The OMS contract covers OMS Production and data signal processing development.  Of OMS hardware components, sensors, telemetry, processing and display hardware, what all will be delivered under the OMS contract?
Answer:  This will be defined in the OMS specification.
  Offerors have the opportunity to propose a new, innovative telemetry scheme.  OMS will be displayed on the ECDWS (display hardware is NOT the responsibility of the OMS Offeror), the ERD and the DOOW (both of which ARE the responsibility of the Offeror).  Other hardware components and sensors can remain the same or be modified or replaced as indicated by the Offerors proposals.

6)	Since TI-16 and APB-15 are undefined how will Offerors scope and cost the effort?  Will the government specify labor categories and hours in the RFP?
Answer:  Although TI-16 and APB-15 are undefined, the Offeror should be able to scope and cost the effort based on the current available technical GFI (located in the TIC), the Offerors experience, and their expertise.
  The Offeror shall propose a labor mix based on the skill levels and hours they believe will be required to satisfy the RFP requirements.

7)	What are the relevant NAICS codes for each of the procurements?
Answer:  ARCI, CAC and OMS  NAICS code is 334511

8)	For CAC, what are the relevant MIL-Standard requirements for the cabinet (MIL-SPEC-AMission Critical)?
Answer:  The CAC enclosure will be provided as GFE.  It will be a Grade B cabinet and requirements will be provided in the Performance Specification in the TIC.

9)	For CAC, what is the expected value of the contract?
Answer:  Anticipated maximum value of the CAC contract will be $50 million. 

10)	For CAC, what are the expected production numbers per year?
Answer:  Will be provided with draft RFP.
  

11)	For CAC, if there is a current incumbent, who is it?
Answer:  The CAC is the replacement cabinet for the Multi-Purpose Processor (MPP).  GD-AIS is the incumbent on the MPP design. 

12)	What are your expected Navy Budgets for each of the three procurements over the contract durations?  This information will assist Industry in performing the necessary ROI determinations prior to making any Bid decision.
Answer:  Estimated maximum values of the contracts are as follow:
ARCI  $1.9 billion
CAC  $50 million
OMS  $50 million   

13)	Is an Oral Presentation part of all three competitions?
Answer:  Yes.

14)	Will OMS and CAC also require ORAL Presentations?
Answer:  Yes.

15)	Will the CAC be considered as a replacement candidate for any of the other acoustic cabinets?
Answer:  Offerors are welcome to propose any innovations thought beneficial to the Navy.

16)	Since both CAC and OMS are based on legacy SBIR designs, what level of technical data will be provided to competitors for their successors?
Answer:  Successful Offerors will deliver based on the Performance Specification provided for review in the TIC.
  Source technical materials such as the IETM will be provided as GFI. 

17)	Is the Diving Officer of the Watch display part of the CAC or OMS?
Answer:  The DOOW display is part of the OMS contract.

18)	Technology Insertion (TI) Working Groups are currently making decisions and performing Analysis that will determine the TI-14 Hardware configurations.  Since the TI-16 and TI-18 hardware configurations will be derivatives of the TI-14 design, may potential bidders participate in these working groups or be provided their meeting notes and design decisions in order to prepare their proposals in response to the RFPs?
Answer:  The Navy is looking at allowing prospective bidders to observe in the TI Working Groups.
  However, a final decision on this has not been determined at this time.  A further response will be provided when a determination has been reached.  

19)	Are the string development responsibilities for SA/HFP/LCCA/LWWAA part of the A-RCI Integrators responsibilities, or will they be GFE/GFI to the successful bidder for the Integrators role?
Answer:  See answer to Question #4.

20)	Why has the government made the CAC a Small Business Set Aside?
Answer:  As per the FAR, a decision was made to set aside this contract for small business.  See Subpart 19.502-2(b).

21)	What is the IWS-5 involvement with OMS software?  Will an initial build of OMS software be provided to the OMS contractor?
Answer:  There will be limited involvement with IWS-5A.
  OMS software will not be provided to the OMS contractor; it will be the contractors responsibility to develop and deliver this.

22)	If new Towed Array sensors become available that change the way the array is processed, will it be introduced on the TI schedule or the APB schedule?
Answer:  Array processing changes could be either software or hardware dependent on the scope of the change.  Introduction of new sensor technology will be coordinated through the PMS401 program office.

23)	What are the numbers in parentheses on slide 20?
Answer:  These are the Unit Numbers of each of the current ARCI cabinets.

24)	How do capability shortfalls that require a hardware solution feed into the TI process?  For example, if the fleet determined that sonar displays would be more effective if presented in a stereoscopic or 3D cube (Voxel) display hardware, how would the A-RCI developmental process implement both the TI to provide the new displays as well as the APB software needed to use the new hardware?
Answer:  Capability shortfalls are identified by the Submarine Tactical Requirements Group (STRG).
  IWS-5A evaluates these capabilities and develops any required software applications.  If there are hardware changes required to enable these capabilities, these are addressed by PMS401 via solutions developed through the Technology Insertion (TI) Integrated Product Team (IPT).

25)	In addition to PMS-401's direct needs: 1) is it anticipated IWS-5 will procure integration services for APB's through the upcoming ARCI contract; or that 2) APB integration services are/will be provided by separate procurement; or that 3) the APB process does not include a traditional lead integration agent role?
Answer:  IWS-5 does not integrate, that is a program office responsibility.  The A-RCI contract can be used by IWS-5, if required.

26)	Will today's Industry Day attendance list be made available to attendees [desirable for promoting teaming opportunities]?
Answer:  No.
  It is the responsibility of the prospective Offeror to determine teaming partners.

27)	Will the Common Acoustic Cabinet (CAC) contract specify Build to Print or Build to Spec?
Answer:  Build to Specification under an LOE contract.

<CONTACT>Angela M. Lagneaux, Purchasing and Supply Management Specialist, Phone 2022688570, Email angela.m.lagneaux@usps.gov - Cindy D. Miller, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-268-5238, Email Cindy.D.Miller@usps.gov
<DESC><p>The internet continues to transform how we do business and communicate with one another, and citizens are increasingly looking to the Federal Government to provide services online. This need is often addressed by agencies offering citizens access to applications by means of usernames and passwords. While this enables agencies to provide some online government services, it creates a burden to the citizen to manage a username and password for each agency application they need to access - as well as a costly burden on each agency to issue and manage these usernames and passwords.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, many high-value Federal applications cannot be put online because passwords do not provide a high enough level of assurance; the next generation of online government applications will require multi-factor authentication.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), signed by the President in April of 2011, seeks to help address this issue. The Strategy's vision is: "individuals and organizations utilize secure, efficient, easy-to-use, and interoperable identity solutions to access online services in a manner that promotes confidence, privacy, choice, and innovation." The NSTIC calls for Federal Agencies to be early adopters of the Identity Ecosystem envisioned in NSTIC, calling on agencies to "lead by example and implement the Identity Ecosystem for the services it provides internally and externally."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Agencies have been challenged in this to date, however, due to technical, policy and cost barriers that have made it challenging to accept third-party credential providers accredited by the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) initiative.</p>
<p>In response, the White House created a Federal Cloud Credential Exchange (FCCX) Tiger Team, co-chaired by NSTIC NPO and FICAM, which is governed by the General Services Administration (GSA). The FCCX Tiger Team consisted of a group of representatives from agencies that have a large population of external customers accessing their applications. This group was tasked with supporting the implementation of NSTIC and continuing progress to help Executive Branch Agencies align with Trust Framework Solutions (TFS) under the FICAM initiative.</p>
<p>The FCCX Tiger Team identified requirements, a technical architecture, and a set of implementation recommendations for an enterprise, cloud-based service that can provide all Federal agencies with an ability to accept the full range of FICAM-approved third-party credentials for online services for citizens. The creation of FCCX will support agencies in meeting the goals of NSTIC and FICAM, being early adopters of strong federated identity solutions, and improving security, privacy and convenience for U.S. citizens. Moreover, FCCX will enable agencies to more easily offer online a variety of citizen-facing services that are currently mired in the paper world.</p>
<p>To validate the requirements developed and gauge from industry suppliers how they might implement a privacy-enhancing, cloud-based, federated credential exchange service the FCCX Tiger Team hosted an Industry Day on August 7th, 2012 along with a request to suppliers to respond to market research questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The responses helped to further refine the requirements and implementation strategy.</p>
<p>In November, 2012, the United States Postal Service (USPS) was chosen to implement and operate a pilot version of FCCX on behalf of the Federal Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The FCCX pilot process will be led by the USPS Digital Solutions Group (DSG). The DSG was established to identify, develop and bring to market digital offerings that can enhance the value of the USPS, its products and services, and spur the growth of American commerce. In doing so, the DSG will help ensure the long term relevance and ability of the USPS to provide digital services to the citizens. The DSG operates within an innovations structure that leverages leading private sector practices and ensures effective integration with internal management, marketing and technology initiatives.<br /><br />USPS will be issuing a competitive solicitation for the FCCX pilot.&nbsp; The solicitation will be released within the&nbsp;next two&nbsp;weeks.&nbsp; The timeline will be very aggressive.&nbsp; Proposal responses will be due three weeks from solicitation issuance date.&nbsp; Supplier demonstrations/oral presentations will be scheduled in late January with contract award in February 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time.

If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.<br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/.

All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of IV Gravity Tubing. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and for which the products meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br /><br />The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Bethesda Naval Hospital, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, and Operational U.S. Forces. This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV Program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, a vendor must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO's Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding the DLA Troop Support Med-Surg PV Program please access the web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is July 2011. The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Point of Contact: Mr. Robert Halliday, MMESO Europe Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil and 011-49-6221-172109.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of IV Gravity Tubing. Within MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $7,246,190.92. This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top nineteen (19) clustered groups of the total one hundred four (104) clustered groups accounts for 80.12% ($5,829,002.52) of the total volume in sales ($7,246,190.92) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 19 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>A vendor interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, robert.halliday@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Europe via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor that does not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO Europe reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical/ Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability.

<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. Each evaluator will evaluate each IV Gravity Tubing product sample from each vendor against the established criteria. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the criteria and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)-Completely unacceptable, two (2)-overwhelmingly unacceptable, three (3)-partially unacceptable, four (4)-acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable. The MMESO TPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified or has not been selected will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately fourteen (14) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the pre-source selection procedures, the MMESO CPT validated/approved clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. (Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goal .03.04.01 (NPSG) Goal 3 - Improve the safety of using medications) The drip chamber is clear and allows visualization of drops. <br />2.

(CDC &amp; NIOSH Publication No. 2000.108, November 1999 entitled, Preventing Needlestick Injuries in Health Care Settings, and the OSHA standards for needleless technology for needle stick prevention measures to prevent contracting blood borne pathogens) The needless luer lock port connection is functional allowing medication/fluid to be instilled into the intravenous system.<br />7. (CDC &amp; NIOSH Publication No. 2000.108, November 1999 entitled, Preventing Needlestick Injuries in Health Care Settings, and the OSHA standards for needleless technology for needle stick prevention measures to prevent contracting blood borne pathogens) The manifold needleless luer lock port connections are functional allowing medication/fluid to be instilled into the intravenous system.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified and invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost) will be selected.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Brace Walking. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best price for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR). It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>Vendor is not required to quote for each MMESO AOR. The Government will make a single selection for each of the following MMESO AORs:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. MMESO North</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. MMESO South</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. MMESO West</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. MMESO Pacific</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. MMESO Europe<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Bethesda Naval Hospital, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is November 2011. The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. <br /><strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil 011-49-6221-172109 and Mr. Tom Winkel, Data Analyst, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil 011-49-6221-172106.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Brace Walking. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,025,368.84. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, one hundred sixteen (116) of the total one hundred ninety-nine (199) line items represent the top six (6) products and accounts for 79.0% ($809,658.86) of the total volume in sales $1,025,368.84) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. Estimated annual demand per Area of Responsibility is approximately MMESO North $254,003.12, MMESO South $242,884.30, MMESO West $288,340.57, MMESO Europe $157,102.14, and MMESO Pacific $76,949.51. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 6 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Rob Halliday, Clinical Analyst, at robert.halliday@us.army.mil and Mr. Tom Winkel, Data Analyst, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO Europe via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO RFIAQ, will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</span></strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for each MMESO AOR based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. The MMESO Europe reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative.

The product will have padding that will wick moisture to control temperature inside the brace, making it comfortable to wear and preventing skin break down, surgical site infection or pressure ulcers.<br />5. OSHA SIC 3842-Product performance - The product's dynamic/adjustable hinge allows for the clinician's prescribed ankle position. The hinged walking brace must have plantarflexion, dorsiflexion and neutral position capability allowing the clinician to place the ankle joint in the desired anatomic position necessary for healing to occur.<br />6. OSHA SIC 3842-Product performance - The product's pneumatic liner provides stability and comfort to the injured/diseased body part. The pre-inflated or adjustable air chambered liner must provide stability of the injured or diseased body part without adding pressure to soft tissue, thereby causing discomfort to the patient and delayed healing.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe and must be received by 5:00PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement. Pricing should be provided for each MMESO AOR based on a committed volume of 80% of the total volume in sales of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. Vendor quotes will contain separate pricing for each MMESO AOR(s) that was identified in Technical / Company Requirements above. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for each MMESO AOR. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected for each MMESO AOR.</strong></span></p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Support Ankle. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.</strong>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is April 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization</strong> <strong>Cost) will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. <br /><br /></strong></span><strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil and COM 011-49-6221-172109 or Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil and COM 011-49-6221-172106</strong>.</p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Support Ankle. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $979,236.34. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, ninety-three (93) of the total one hundred seventy-three (173) line items represent the top seven (7) products and accounts for 82.76% ($810,499.74) of the total volume in sales ($979,236.34) in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil or Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company criteria listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Europe via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor, who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO RFIAQ, will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO Europe reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning procedures the MMESO CPT approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The ten (10) requirements below must be answered and all supporting documentation provided with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /><br /></strong></span>1.

The scale descriptors are: one (1)-Completely Unacceptable, two (2)-Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)-Partially Unacceptable, four (4)-Acceptable, and five (5)-Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified or has not been selected will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately thirteen (13) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning procedures the MMESO CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below: <br />1. NAICS 339113-Patient Comfort - Product is lightweight. The ankle support must be lightweight in order to provide patient comfort due to the duration the device may need to be applied.<br />2. NAICS 339113-Proper Fit and Patient Safety - The product has adjustable securement devices. The ankle support must have securement devices that allow for proper fit and reduced migration resistance to stabilize the injured or diseased lower extremity body part.<br />3. NAICS 339113-Patient Comfort - Product has features to provide comfort and stability to the injured/diseased body part. The ankle support must have padding that contours to the injured or diseased lower body part providing support and stabilization necessary for healing.</p>
<p>Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe and must be received by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></span></p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>

Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) MSFSC(underscore)EPIC(underscore)EAST@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

N00244L332, UNIT PRICES (OCT 2001) (FISC SAN DIEGO)
Contractor unit prices, when incorporated into a Government contract, will be released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) without further notice to the contractor submitter.
  If the Contractor takes issue with the release, it should submit its proposal data with the appropriate legends and explain in detail why such data cannot be released as a public record under the Freedom of Information Act.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation: The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and price related factors. The Government intends to award the contract to the eligible, low-priced, responsible offeror (see FAR 15.304).  Award will be made upon price reasonableness determination, contractor determination of responsibility within the meaning of FAR Part 9, and acceptance to the provisions set forth herein.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
(i)	Ability to meet the requirements (see attached requirements)
(ii)	Price
The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i), the non-price factor. (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.)
Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the Government will rate the quote as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award.
 
For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i), the Government will then evaluate Factor (ii), Price.  Ability to meet the requirements and delivery time when combined, are equal to price. 
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
(b) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating commercial product brochures, drawings and technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.
 Offerors technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation. Items offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable. Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 
A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or electronically furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
 
Submit offers via NECO or email to Shannon La Com who can be reached at email Shannon.lacom@navy.mil .  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  
 
Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.sam.gov/  . 
 
Questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via email to the above Government point of contact. 

All quotes shall include price(s), a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, contractors CAGE code, tax identification number and payment terms.
 Quotes will not be accepted by facsimile. Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the offeror to meet all specifications and requirements.

<p>Solicitation Number: H92222-12-R-0059<br />Notice Type: Solicitation/Request for Proposal<br />Classification Code: R - Professional, administrative, and management support services<br />NAICS Code: 541 - Professional, Scientific, and Technical Service<br />541930 - Translation and Interpretation Services<br />Synopsis: DISCLAIMER - The Request for Proposal was preceded by a DRAFT RFP posted on FBO 17 October 2012.</p>
<p>CLOSING DATE: 25 January 2013</p>
<p>This is a formal Request for Proposal (RFP). USSOCOM is seeking proposals from sources that can provide foreign language interpretation, transcription, reporting, and translation services (NAICS Code 541930) in support of various units worldwide.<br />This is solicited and will be awarded on a Full and Open Competition basis.<br />Attached to this RFP are documents available via an Explicit Access request. To gain Explicit Access to this information, Contractor Personnel must be categorized within FBO with the proper NAICS Code for this requirement. This precaution has been established to limit the dissemination of sensitive unclassified information. To gain access to all of the Unclassified Explicit Access documents (with the exception of the CLASSIFIED documents), please request via this FBO posting. NOTE: Vendor's who received Explicit Access for the DRAFT RFP stage MUST requests access again as the documents have been updated.</p>
<p>To gain Restricted Access to the CLASSIFIED documents, Contractor Personnel must be approved by DSS (and confirmed by USSOCOM) to store CLASSIFIED material up to the TOP SECRET Level. All interested vendors shall submit DSS documentation that approves the storage of CLASSIFIED material (to include ship-to address)and the individual(s) requesting such material shall have current/valid Security Clearances (documentation needs to be provided as well). Providing complete packages/copies of all documentation is required. Incomplete packages, pending, or in-process documentation/clearances will NOT be accepted in part or full. ALL interested Offerors shall have this in place as of the closing date of this formal RFP date. Under no circumstance will interested Prime Contractor Offerors be able to utilize a potential Sub-Contractor's Classified Storage capability as proof of classified storage capability.<br />NOTE: For those vendors who submitted documentation during the DRAFT phase of this RFP, MUST RESUBMIT documents for this formal RFP as well. Repeat, all vendors must RESUBMIT their facility's ability to store CLASSIFIED material up to the SECRET Level, as well as personal security clearances.</p>
<p>USSOCOM will not provide any sponsorship for Security Clearances to enable access the CLASSIFIED portion of this requirement. A prerequisite to this requirement is that all interested vendors that wish to propose for the Prime Contractor role MUST demonstrate DSS approved CLASSIFIED Storage Capability and Individual Security Clearances. Failure to do so will cause the Proposal to be rejected, and will not be evaluated further, and therefore not eligible for award. <br />Upon successful confirmation of clearances and storage capability, USSOCOM will mail all CLASSIFIED documents to the approved physical ship-to address location of the interested vendor, after DSS Facility Clearance has been verified with USSOCOM Security.</p>
<p><br />**Questions regarding this RFP must be emailed (in writing) and submitted to the Contracting Officer (addresses below). Oral requests (e.g. phone call) for information will be re-directed to provide email correspondence, for documentation purposes.**<br />Only unclassified questions may be transmitted. If the prospective vendor has questions of a classified nature, please contact Elizabeth Holland for secure method of transmittal.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION REGULATION (HSAR) CLAUSE
HSAR 3052.209-70	Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates	(Jun 2006)

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

                                               STATEMENT OF WORK



Background
The U.S. Coast Guard requires short term lease services for all labor, materials, scaffolding, supervision and OHSA certified inspection necessary to erect, position, and dismantle Tubular and Coupler heavy maintenance scaffolding work platform around an HC-130 aircraft for performance of depot level maintenance at the DRS-C3A Heavy Maintenance Facility (HMF) located adjacent to the Aviation Logistics Center in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. Scaffolding to provide a safe walkway and work platform is necessary for personnel to inspect the aircraft, disassemble portions of the airframe, perform repairs, and re-assemble the airframe to return the aircraft to a flyable status.

Scope
The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, scaffolding, supervision, and OSHA certified inspection necessary to erect, position, and dismantle the scaffolding around an HC-130 aircraft.  Scaffolding supplies must be appropriate for heavy maintenance on the aircraft and must meet OSHA requirements contained in 29 CPR Part 1926, Subpart L.  All scaffolding must be installed, changed, and dismantled by personnel designated as "competently trained" in accordance with OSHA standards.  The scaffolding shall be erected underneath the entire length of both wing sections and the tail section.  The scaffolding must provide a walkway for the entire area under the wing and tail approximately 4 to 5 feet from the underside of the wing/tail surface and extend 5 feet beyond the surface.  No attachment to the floor is permitted.

Requirements
On-site assembly of the scaffold work platform is required Dec. 18, 2012.  Due to aircraft scheduling requirements, the required assembly date may be delayed, but will be no earlier than Dec. 18.  The Contracting Officer will provide written notice a minimum of 48 hours in advance of any change to the required assembly date.

Scaffold Configuration for Total Aircraft, including Tail, with Aircraft Wings Removed.  Includes both sides of the aircraft.
Fuselage/Wing Area: The contractor shall erect a scaffold work platform approximately 25' wide x 64' long x 8-1/2' high.  The work platform shall be 5' to 5-1/2' below the bottom of the wing section. The work platform shall cantilever approximately 2' toward the fuselage to follow the contour to access panels.  The work platform shall be accessible by two stair units, one on each side.  Guardrail shall be installed around the perimeter of the work platform.

Tail Area:  The contractor shall erect a scaffold work platform approximately 16 wide x 61' long x 13
high.  Work platform shall be 5' to 5-1/2' below the bottom of the tail wing.  Work platform shall be accessible by two stair units, one on each end.  Guardrail shall be installed around the perimeter of the work platform.

Aircraft will be located at the DRS Technologies Heavy Maintenance Facility (HMF) adjacent to the
U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.  The contractor will be
permitted to use these facilities in performing the work.  If requested, forklifts will be provided for
unloading and loading of materials, at no risk to the Government.  The Contractor is responsible for
delivery of any and all materials to the job site and aircraft work area.  Sufficient area for staging is available on site.  Special precautions shall be taken by the Contractor to ensure construction materials and debris do not enter the airfield, runways, or taxiways.

All applicable Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for Contractor provided material must be provided upon delivery of the material.

Verbal notice will be given in the event any safety issues are discovered.  Safety issues must be resolved within 12 hours of such notice.

When scaffolding is no longer required by the Government, written notice transmitted electronically from the Contracting Officer, shall be provided to the Contractor.    Completion of dismantling and/ or removal of scaffolding shall be accomplished within 48 hours of such notice.

Quotes shall include a firm fixed price hourly labor rate to be used in the event the Government determines that a configuration change is required. Written notice transmitted electronically from the Contracting Officer, shall be provided to the Contractor.  Configuration changes shall be accomplished within 24 hours of receipt of such notice.  Compensation for configuration changes shall be "portal to portal", meaning round trip between the Contractor's facility and the DRS HMF in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. Configuration changes may result in increasing or decreasing scaffolding and would represent either an increase or decrease of the rental costs.  Costs not defined by the firm-fixed prices in the Schedule of Supplies/Services are subject to negotiation and approval by the Contracting Officer prior to the commencement of work.

Work shall be performed during routine working hours, from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday excluding safety issues.  Resolution of safety issues required outside of routine working hours shall not result in additional costs or financial liability to the Government.

All scaffolding must be installed, changed, and dismantled by personnel designated as "competently trained" in accordance with OSHA standards.  Copies of the inspection/certification documents shall be provided to the Government Representative, the DRS Technologies Heavy Maintenance Facility Representative, and the Contracting Officer prior to the erection and use of scaffolding.

The Contractor is solely responsible for workplace safety while at the DRS. Technologies Heavy Maintenance Facility.  The contractor shall provide appropriate safety barricades, signs, signal lights, etc., as well as comply with all Federal, State, and Local safety regulations.   Upon completion of the erection, reconfiguration, or disassembly of the scaffolding, the Contractor shall clean the job site, returning it to a state of cleanliness equal to that in which the jobsite was provided.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br /></p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>TRDM is the USTRANSCOM tool used to manage enterprise reference data. The tool is owned by the Government and maintained and modernized, as necessary, by the Contractor. TRDM includes data from the former Table Management Distribution System (TMDS), which managed Air Mobility Command (AMC) reference data. The majority of this data has since transitioned to TRDM and remaining tables and interfaces associated with TMDS are being migrated to TRDM. The reference data management process is consistent with the Information Reference Model (IRM) manual as published by USTRANSCOM/J6. The TRDM Program Management Office (PMO) is responsible for providing and interpreting USTRANSCOM policy as it applies to TRDM.<br /><br />This contract will combine the maintenance of the reference tables, design and implementation of new capabilities, to include the expansion of the Real Property Unique Identifier Registry (RPUIR) capability to become the information management system, dubbed the Data Analytics and Integration Support (DAIS) platform, supporting OSD (I&amp;E) Business Enterprise Integration office Real Property Inventory Reporting (RPIR) and Enterprise Energy Information Management (EEIM) requirements. In FY2003, the Installations &amp; Environment (I&amp;E) Domain partnered with the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and other Business Management Modernization Program (BMMP) Business Mission Areas (BMAs) to transform or reengineer business processes for the accountability of real property. The goal was, and still is, the availability of reliable, timely, and useful real property asset information to support functional analysis and decision making as well as financial reporting. Inter-Agency and Cross-Service work groups were established to identify the data elements and to analyze and resolve process issues. The results were approved in January 2005 as the RPIR document. The long term goal is to expand the current functions of the RPUIR by incorporating the full Real Property Information Model (RPIM). Real Property Unique Identifiers (RPUIDs) will continue to be implemented for the nearly 1 million global site and real property assets and the DAIS system will continue to act as the centralized data source for RPUIDs both for initial assignment of new RPUIDs and for lookup of existing RPUIDs.<br /><br />The DUSD (I&amp;E) convened a working group to standardize energy information and business processes utilizing existing enterprise information to the extent possible. The standard data elements that the working group developed became the EEIM model. As incorporated within the DAIS System, EEIM will provide net-centric energy data access services and an energy data warehouse that will provide a consolidated view of timely, reliable energy information for use in measuring, managing and reporting DoD energy consumption, conservation, and renewable energy production information. DoD's facility energy vision is to use integrated processes and a standard data structure to collect facility energy consumption, renewable energy generation, and energy efficiency project data. This integrated information structure will facilitate trend analysis, performance comparison, and efficiency improvement across facilities and DoD Components.<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide continuing on-site support services contributing directly to the management of reference data for USTRANSCOM, its Transportation Component Commands: AMC, Military Sealift Command (MSC), Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), and other Department of Defense (DoD) communities. DoD is subject to extensive energy reporting requirements that impose a growing burden on DoD personnel to collect, analyze, package, and transmit energy data. DoD currently does not have standardized enterprise facility energy information, nor does it have enterprise-wide information technology systems to support facility energy management. This lack of standardization requires energy managers and other personnel to manually collect, transform, and reformat data to meet separate data calls. This highly inefficient atmosphere leaves energy managers with little time to manage facility energy consumption, or to focus on ways to improve facility energy efficiency.<br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<p>2.  ISSUANCE DATE: December 20, 2012</p>
<p>3. CLOSING DATE/TIME FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: January 24, 2013, 5:00 pm EST</p>
<p>4.  POSITION TITLE: OTI Program Operations Advisor</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: This position has been designated as a "tandem" position that, depending on the qualifications of the candidate, can be filled at either the GS-11 (salary range: $62,467 - $81,204) or GS-12 (salary range: $74,872 - $97,333) equivalent level, DC-locality pay.  The actual salary of the successful candidate will be negotiated within the pay range of the GS-11 or GS-12 level depending on qualifications, previous relevant experience and work history, salary and educational background.  Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated.</p>
<p>NOTE:  Applicants who submit an application for the GS-12 grade level, but do not meet the minimum qualifications as outlined in this solicitation and as reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEC) will not be considered for the GS-11 positions if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-11 level. Similarly, applicants who apply for the GS-11 position even though they might meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-12 position will not be considered for the higher graded position if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-12 position.  Applicants who are unsure of which grade level they meet the minimum qualifications should submit a separate application for each grade level.<br />6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  One year, with four one-year option periods.  The Personal Services Contractor(s) hired under this contract will provide up to a maximum of 250 workdays of services on an annual basis.  <br />The specific projects, as well as dates, number of days and locations to be worked will be determined by mutual agreement between the contractor and his/her OTI supervisor according to the programmatic needs of OTI.  There is no obligation by OTI to provide assignments for a minimum number of days, and the contractor will be free to provide "blackout" dates during which he/she will not be available to accept assignments.</p>
<p>This recruitment is for an intermittent USPSC.  Therefore, if an incumbent is selected at the GS-11 grade level, the candidate does not have the opportunity for advancement to the GS-12 equivalent grade.  However, once the candidate reaches the minimum qualifications of the GS-12 grade, he/she may apply for a GS-12 position if the position is resolicited by the Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI in the future.  Extension of the contract is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, D.C. with possible travel as stated in the position description.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely assistance to support and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances are designed to promote progress or prevent backsliding. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>DCHA/OTI is an exciting, fast-paced, operational office in USAID. Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that OTI USPSC staff are deployed and supported expeditiously and programs started quickly, often with little or no lead time.  The Program Operations Advisor position is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support.  To achieve this, OTI requires a Program Operations Advisor who has the capacity to work well within a team environment, provide necessary support to a team, and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit. A common characteristic among OTI staff is that they are operationally-minded, enjoy working in a fast-paced environment, and seek innovative ways to improve efficiency and effectiveness of operations support and programs.</p>
<p>The Program Operations Advisor is experienced in the multitude of functions that comprise program operations for USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives programs.  The Program Operations Advisor provides services which require professionalism, knowledge, diplomacy, and operational expertise in administrative support.  This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation.  While most of the work will be performed in Washington, there may be requirements for field travel.  OTI field offices are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence.  The Program Operations Advisor reports to the Chief of OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD) or his/her designee which may be the Deputy Chief of OMD or other OMD Team Leaders, the Chief of Field Programs Division (FPD) or FPD Regional Team Leaders.  The Program Operations Advisor will spend the majority of his or her time working with OMD support staff in Washington.  All of the field activities supported and the vast majority of the headquarters activities supported are transition program implementation-focused.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a Program Operations Advisor to support the Operations and Management Division within OTI.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Program Operations Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the OTI Program Operations Advisor requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The OTI Program Operations Advisor is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The OTI Program Operations Advisor is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The OTI Program Operations Advisor has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The OTI Program Operations Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>

When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Solicitations shall specify that award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. If the contracting officer documents the file pursuant to 15.304(c)(3)(iii), past performance need not be an evaluation factor in lowest price technically acceptable source selections. If the contracting officer elects to consider past performance as an evaluation factor, it shall be evaluated in accordance with 15.305.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Description of Anticipated Requirement:</p>
<p>The Air Force intends to acquire CLS for the Halvorsen weapon system under a FAR Part 15 contract. <br />The Contractor will provide a broad range of support for a fleet of 443 deployed Halvorsen loaders. <br />The Contractor will provide and integrate this support in five output-oriented areas. <br />Each of these areas is described below and will be supplemented by the Prime Item Development Specification.</p>
<p><br />The five areas are as follows:<br /><br />PIPELINE/MATERIAL MANAGEMENT<br />Demand forecasting and purchasing of parts and material<br />Manufacturing and/or repair of parts<br />Warehousing<br />Packaging<br />Transportation <br /><br />REVERSE ENGINEERING<br />Develop and deliver an ASME Y14.100 based technical data package (TDP) sufficient for lifecycle support of the Halvorsen; NOTE: Technical data package will be limited to maintenance support (i.e., parts replacement, overhaul, and unscheduled depot level maintenance) since there are no plans for reprocurement of total system.</p>
<p>LIFECYCLE ENGINEERING<br />Configuration Management/Change Management<br />Technology Insertion<br />Logistics Engineering, Including Training<br />Design Responsibility<br />Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS)<br />Systems Engineering to include Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E)<br />Technical Order Management<br />Reduction of Total Ownership Costs (RTOC)<br />Lifecycle Data Management<br />Performance Data Analysis<br />Modification Development</p>
<p>UNSCHEDULED DEPOT LEVEL MAINTENANCE<br />Depot Level Repair (on and off-site)<br />Modifications</p>
<p>LOADER OVERHAUL<br />Total Refurbishment of the Loader<br />Reliability-Centered Maintenance <br />Modifications</p>
<p><br />Loader Description:<br />The Halvorsen is a self-propelled 25,000 pound capacity aircraft cargo transporter loader. The Halvorsen weighs approximately 32,000 pounds; is approximately 14'2'' wide by 29'7'' long; and is approximately 23 feet tall when fully extended. It transfers loads to and from warehouses, and to and from cargo aircraft on the flightline. The Halvorsen interfaces with docks in warehouses and all Air Force cargo aircraft, including many commercial Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) aircraft. The Halvorsen's powered conveyor system moves loads on unit load devices (ULDs): pallets, platforms, and containers. The roller system on the deck converts to a flat deck for rolling stock loads. The deck lowers to 39 inches and raises to 18 feet 94 inches, and rolls, side-shifts, and pitches. The Halvorsen is air transportable on the C-130, C-5, and C-17 aircraft. The Halvorsen was designed for a service life of 30 years with a maximum of 2 overhauls. The Halvorsen has a six cylinder Detroit Diesel D706LTE engine, an Allison 4 speed automatic transmission, and front wheel drive. The Halvorsen has a maximum speed of 17 mph, and a turning radius of 25 ft.</p>
<p>Operational Capabilities:<br />The Halvorsen is used to Load/Unload Military and CRAF Fleets. It handles up to 3 standard 463L pallets 88X108 with a total capacity of up to 25,000 lbs. It is Multi Cargo Capable including rolling stock. The Halvorsen has a Deck Reach up to 225 inches (18 ft 94 in) for wide body aircraft and 39 inches for C-130 aircraft. All deck controls are contained in the operators cab. The Halvorsen can operate in temperatures ranges from -40 degrees F to +125 degrees F. It can be reconfigured for transport in less than &frac12; hour with no tools required and has a shipping weight of approximately 32,000 lbs. Thus, the Halvorsen can be air transported on C-130, C-17 and C-5 aircraft.</p>
<p>Program Description:<br />The Air Force does not own the technical data for the Halvorsen loader therefore, the Contractor will be required through reverse engineering to develop and deliver a technical data package to the Air Force. The Contractor will use and maintain the TDP as part of the lifecycle management of the Halvorsen weapon system. OEM/Vendor exclusivity agreements, patents, foreign content, and licenses may exist; however, the level and extent are unknown. Operator and field maintenance manuals are available subject to limited data rights.</p>
<p>Technical support shall be provided 24 hours a day and 7 days a week to the field by telephone. Technical support shall include providing repair instructions to the field when a particular repair is not covered by the TO, providing explanations of the TOs to the field when needed, etc. Potential SRB projects can be generated and input by anyone through e-mail, AF deficiency reports (DR), system review board (SRB), and phone. The SRB is a joint Air Force and contractor multi-disciplined board for the purpose of directing technical activities.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be responsible for all material pipeline/material management to support approximately 165 worldwide locations. Management of returned parts for repair or analysis will be required. Reparable "part cores" may be returned to the Contractor for repair. The Contractor will be expected to manage and forecast inventory levels continually. The Contractor will receive some Air Force historical parts demand and maintenance data. The Air Force will provide to the Contractor some inventory of consumable, reparable, and investment parts at the outset of the new CLS contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide lifecycle engineering support using the principles of systems engineering. The Contractor will be responsible for assuring Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E), product life cycle management (PLM), product data management, technical order management and cost control. OSS&amp;E baselines have been established and the Contractor will be required to assure no degradation throughout the life of the system. Suitability is the ability of the Halvorsen to operate within the Air Force system. Effectiveness is the ability of the Halvorsen to perform as intended. This means that any changes required as a result of obsolescence, vanishing vendors, cost reduction, correction of deficiencies, etc. must not degrade the safety, suitability or effectiveness of the system. Configuration control is necessary for status accounting of the parts installed on each loader, and any special repairs or modifications must be documented. Configuration status accounting of each loader is required for future reliability analysis, correction of deficiencies, and overhaul of the loader.</p>
<p>Lifecycle engineering will provide corrective actions and implementation to resolve deficiencies, and the issuance of Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs) when required. The Contractor will be responsible for verification of form, fit, function, and interface of corrective actions. The Contractor will be the management agency for Halvorsen TOs. Lifecycle engineering will include maintenance of the engineering documentation such as engineering drawings, TOs, structural analyses, and safety assessment reports.</p>
<p>Accident repair will be field repair when possible, and repair at a contractor depot facility when required. Vehicle overhaul could include modifications, reliability-centered maintenance, and repair of structural abnormalities. Manufacturing personnel will be required to fulfill, on an annual basis, the requirements of process certifications in welding (e.g., AWS), corrosion control, hydraulics, riveting, and inspection. Where there are no organizational or societal procedures, the Contractor will be required to develop procedures.</p>
<p>The Air Force will provide the Contractor with two loaders in preparation for depot overhaul qualification. <br />The Contractor will tear down and rebuild two (2) Halvorsen loaders and develop a Halvorsen Overhaul Instructions Manual for manufacturing to qualify and accomplish future overhauls. <br />The Contractor will be expected to conduct depot overhaul on&nbsp;up to 50 loaders each year. <br />The Contractor will address structural abnormalities and non-standard repairs as they are discovered.</p>
<p><br />Additional information may be provided via additions to this posting.</p>

<a href="mailto:montgomery.l.mcclelland.civ@mail.mil">ACC - Warren (ACC-WRN)(DTA)</a>
<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:		  <br>    <br>  THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.  <br>    <br>  TOPIC:  <br>    <br>  TARDEC is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources with the expertise necessary to  rapidly modify a HMMWV braking system to improve stopping performance, handling, safety, and durability throughout the range of vehicle weights, weight distributions, and center of gravity (CG) locations of the current HMMWV fleet (7,100 lbs. to 16,500 lbs.).  The brake systems that satisfy all of the requirements below may be evaluated via modeling and simulation, and have the potential to be purchased and tested in a lab or on a HMMWV of the Governments choosing.  Emphasis should be placed on ready to field, low cost solutions that have a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7 or higher currently.    <br>    <br>  The braking systems must be applicable and adaptable to the military environment as well as meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 105.  This environment includes extreme ambient operating conditions from -40 C to 60 C (-40  to 140  Fahrenheit), storage conditions of -51 C to 71 C (-60  to 160  Fahrenheit), as well as extreme shock and vibration outlined in MIL-STD-810.  Both our soldiers and vehicle components must be capable of operating effectively within this environment.    <br>  	  <br>  TARDEC is requesting information on proven brake system technologies in the area of calipers, pads, rotors, proportioning valves, master cylinders, power assist/boosters, hard lines and hoses, electronic brake distribution (EBD) systems, Anti-lock Brake Systems (ABS), and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) systems.  The Government is looking for technologies that require little to no changes to the vehicle to integrate, and that can be purchased now or quickly modified and purchased within 6 months, using existing manufacturing processes if possible, for this request. If vehicle modifications are required, as they will be with EBD, ABS and/or ESC systems, please specify the required changes, the amount of time, estimated component costs,  and level of effort needed to make the system effective.  <br>    <br>  Responders to this survey should clearly and briefly address the category as well as address the ADDITIONAL INFORMATION requested below.    <br>    <br>  QUESTIONS:  <br>    <br>  Proven braking system technologies  <br>    <br>  Objectives: - To evaluate and analyze proven braking system technologies that could be used to improve HMMWV stopping performance, handling safety, and durability throughout the Family of Vehicles (FoV) weight ranges.  <br>    <br>  Responders to this market survey should clearly and briefly address:  <br>     <br>   	Proven braking system technologies    <br>   	Describe available solutions.  <br>   	Provide any test or analysis results/reports quantifying improvement in stopping performance, handling, off-road mobility, safety, and durability throughout the range of vehicle weights, weight distributions, and center of gravity locations of the current HMMWV fleet (7,100 lbs. to 16,500 lbs.)  <br>   	Describe any additional work/modifications required to implement if it's not a direct one for one swap/replacement.   <br>   	Approximate cost for a vehicle kit.  <br>    <br>    <br>  Does your company have currently developed braking system technology that can be integrated onto existing HMMWV vehicles ranging in weight from 7,100 lbs to 16,500 lbs.?   <br>    <br>  Does your company have currently a brake system technology demonstration HMMWV vehicle that you have already integrated your technology into weighing from 7,100 lbs to 16,500 lbs?  <br>    <br>  Notes:  The existing brake system does not have the ability to manage the weight range of the HMMWV FoVs robustly enough to meet all Federal Safety Standards; TARDEC would like to investigate technologies that can improve the vehicle's robustness to weight change and capabilities.  Further, the designs and materials must be suitable to:   <br>  i.	Withstand all shock and vibration tests specified in MIL-STD-810   <br>  ii.	Operate in the temperature range of  -40 C to 60 C (-40  to 140  Fahrenheit)  <br>  iii.	Have a minimum technology readiness level (TRL) of 7 without additional testing or development.  <br>  iv.	Meet FMVSS 105 requirements for all systems  <br>  v.	Meet FMVSS 126 requirements for ESC proposed systems  <br>    <br>    <br>  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  <br>    <br>  1.	Each response is requested to include:   <br>  a)	A brief (no more than one page) company description, history, and industry experience.  <br>  b)	An executive summary (no more than one page) of the information submitted in reply to this market survey.  <br>  c)	Point(s)-of-Contact (POC) with associated information.  <br>  d)	A brief narrative of any internal or external programs that may be leveraged to assist in the R&D of the described technology  <br>  e)	A brief outline of the technologies function and supporting calculations regarding the technologies ability to support the weight range of the HMMWV mentioned above.  <br>  f)	A brief plan for the application of a systems engineering approach as outlined by DoD Directive 5000.1.  <br>  2.	Each response is requested to document any prior related government work experience.  <br>  3.	Each response should be no more than 10 pages in total.  <br>  4.	Each response should include a completed version of Attachment A.  <br>    <br>    <br>  RESPONSES DUE:  <br>    <br>  Responses to this Market Survey are due by January 6th, 2013.  Please submit all responses and any questions prior to full response to Mr. Geoffrey Bossio via email at geoffrey.r.bossio.civ@mail.mil.  Please format the subject line of the response email as follows;  quote mark [Organization Name] response to Market Survey - High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) Brake System Enhancement Investigation quote mark   <br>    <br>    <br>  RESPONSE FORMAT(S):  <br>    <br>  Only electronic responses are requested.  Please provide responses in any of the following formats:  Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power Point. Please do not send Zip Files or hard copies via mail. The maximum size of each e-mail should be not more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes.  You may use multiple e-mail messages.  The subject line must include message 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3 etc., as well as [Organization Name].  All interested entities *e.g. companies, non-profit organizations, and academic institutes, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.    <br>    <br>    <br>  GENERAL INFORMATION:   <br>    <br>  The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as  quote mark CONFIDENTIAL quote mark  under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:     <br>    <br>        1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps)  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.   <br>     2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected  <br>       3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data,    <br>      4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS: quote mark  and  quote mark PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS quote mark .   <br>       5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.  <br>       6.  The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses.  Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of data as  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting in the evaluation effort.  The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.

<DESC>     This market survey is being reissued because of the change in the size standard for the NAICS code associated with this effort.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 611430 (Professional and Management Development Training) has changed from $7.0 to $10.0 million in average annual receipts. 
     The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms capable of providing instructional services of the nature described in the attached draft statement of work.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
     The FAA has elected to pursue a new business model for management and leadership development.  The nature of the work is instructional delivery, instructional design, instructional development, and the provision of classrooms and lodging for the attendees.  
     The FAA is seeking a quality learning environment in which managers and other internal and external customers develop greater mastery of their leadership responsibilities and the skills needed to achieve the agency's operational and organizational goals.
     The developmental curricula are provided at the corporate level for all agency managers to imbue common core leadership principles and philosophy across the entire agency as a foundation.  The curricula consists of a range of deliveries from broad based leadership and management development for newly appointed managers to courses that are more directly focused on a single subject area with greater detail.  The courses are intended to provide logical, progressive and sequential leadership and management developmental opportunities throughout the employee's life cycle.  Courses vary in length from one (1) to nine (9) days and may be scheduled on a regular and recurring basis or scheduled when needs dictate based on FAA requirements. 
     The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from sources that can provide the learning services as described to the FAA.  Responses to this market survey will be used to finalize the FAA's acquisition strategy for the requirement.  
     The vendor selected will provide learning services, arrange for suitable classroom space in a facility that is within a reasonable distance of a national or regional airport and arrange for appropriate lodging for attendees in close proximity to the learning facility.   All metropolitan areas in the contiguous lower 48 states are being considered.   
     The planned period of performance for this effort is five years from date of award.  The award structure will include a 12 month base period with four 12 month option periods.

<DESC>The Description is changed to the following: <br /><br />The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division intends to enter into negotiations with Northrop Grumman Corporation for retrofits to the Electro-Optical Console that entails the upgrade of the current laser configuration within the Integrated Photonics Assembly (IPA P/N: 2055AS487-2001) to improve its reliability. The contractor is to provide upgraded units, associated technical data, as well as technical and logistics support for this upgrade for all EO3 stations that are specifically configured for ATFLIR and SH60 FLIR. The contractor will also incorporate IPA modifications to address Auto-Collimation Failures. These upgrades will be done as an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) and are intended to be incorporated via attrition through the normal repair/calibration process. This procurement is intended to be a Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) support CLINs and will include the issuance of multiple delivery orders. The contractor shall design, fabricate, test and deliver two (2) initial Pre-production units along with associated data and the Engineering Change Proposal (ECP). This procurement will also include production CLINs, that can be utilized if and when the ECP is approved, where the contractor will be responsible for incorporation of approved ECP upgrades for approximately up to 105 units. The period of performance will be approximately three years. As the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the EO console and specifically the IPA, Northrop Grumman is the only source with the technical data, drawings, software code or other specifications to meet the requirement. The Government intends to procure this requirement under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1. This is not a request for a proposal; however, all parties interested in providing a response must do so not later than 15 days after the date of this notice. A determination by the Government not to open this procurement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE:</span></strong>The Government is in the process of conducting market research to assist the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) in understanding the capabilities available in the market place relevant to information technology, communications, telecommunications and engineering industries to support widget development and maintenance for Joint Planning and Execution Services.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND:</span></strong>DISA Joint Planning &amp; Execution Services (JPES) Project Management Office (PMO), in coordination with DISA's Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), is requesting information to identify small business sources capable of widget development, maintenance and sustainment. <br />The JPES PMO is responsible for providing adaptive planning and execution/force projection capabilities that will be accessible in a net-centric, service-oriented architecture environment. The JPES PMO focuses on providing the joint forces commander with the data and information needed to make timely, effective, and informed decisions. The JPES strategy provides new capabilities as well as evolves current, disparate planning capabilities into a fully integrated, interoperable, and collaborative joint solution. The JPES PMO initiated development of widgets in late FY12 with plans to continue limited development of additional widgets through 1QFY13. During this initial widget development effort, several of the widgets will have gone through the Joint Command and Control (C2) Widget Approval and Accreditation Process (WAAP) and will be ready for fielding and operational use, while others may still be in the testing and accreditation phase upon completion of 1QFY13. The initial widget development effort was focused on: (1) understanding and applying widget technology to build and deploy capability in the Joint C2 Common User Interface (JC2 CUI) environment, (2) integrating with the JPES Framework (JFW) to visualize force projection data, and (3) exercising and supporting the JC2 widget approval and accreditation process (WAAP). <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GENERAL:</span></strong>This Sources Sought notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.

Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in a future RFP, if one is issued.<br /><br />Small businesses under the following North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are strongly encouraged to provide timely responses to this notice: <br /><br />541512 - Computer Systems Design Services - Size Standard $25.5M<br /><br />Businesses may submit further recommendations for NAICS codes. Identification of the above NAICS codes does not bind the Government to issuance of a future solicitation for this requirement under any specific NAICS code. Similarly, any suggested NAICS code recommended by interested vendors does not bind the Government to its use.</p>
<p>A response to this Sources Sought notice is desired in order to assist DISA in determining the potential levels of interest and technical capabilities within the small business community to provide required services. This information will be used to assist DISA in establishing the degree to which a small business set-aside is feasible, including the potential for small business/large business team arrangements.

<DESC>The United States Government seeks to lease office and related support space consisting of approximately 10,900 rentable square feet of office and warehouse space and 1.6 acres of wareyard space in Las Vegas, Nevada. The space should yield a minimum of 10,900 ANSI/BOMA square feet (minimum 900 ABOA office and 10,000 warehouse). The office, warehouse and wareyard space shall be contiguous (the office must be inside the office/warehouse building and the wareyard must be immediately contiguous to the office/warehouse building). <br /><br />The warehouse space offered must have a minimum ceiling clear height of 16'. The space offered must be modifiable to install windows in the exterior walls to provide natural light for the office area and to install roll up doors with a minimum dimension of 14'H x 12"W. The wareyard area must be securable via a fence and adequate lighting. An up-to-date Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment will be required. <br /><br />The proposed space must be located within the following delineated area and must have the following characteristics: <br /><strong><br />North</strong>: Sahara Avenue;<br /><strong>South</strong>: South Hollywood Boulevard, Pabco Road, Warm Springs Road;<br /><strong>East</strong>: Blue Diamond (Rainbow to I15), St Rose Parkway (I15 to 215), 215/564 (564 to Warm Springs Road);<br /><strong>West</strong>: South Rainbow Boulevard.<br /><br />The space should be located in areas similar in nature to an industrial area which is open and has a low population density. Because the agency uses very large vehicles to perform their mission, the space cannot be located in high traffic areas to ensure agency vehicles have adequate turning radius' (are able to exit onto streets and roads in a timely manner without waiting long periods for other vehicles to clear) and are not creating traffic disturbances (blocking traffic). Spaces which are located in areas with easy access to large thoroughfares are preferred.<br /><br />Fully serviced leases are sought. All services, supplies, utilities and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration. The offered space must meet the Governments requirements for Fire, Life-safety, and Handicapped Accessibility. <br /><br />Property located within a base floodplain (100 year floodplain) or wetland will not be considered. <br /><br />The term of the proposed lease is ten (10) years, five (5) years firm. Occupancy is required on or before <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 31, 2013</span></strong>. <br /><br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:<br />Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing and should include the following information at minimum (This is not an invitation for bids or a request for proposals):
<p>&bull; Building name/address<br />&bull; Legal property description, recent survey, and property identification numbers (PIN).<br />&bull; Location of space in the building and date it will be available.<br />&bull; One-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered and Site Plan..<br />&bull; ANSI/BOMA defined office area/useable square feet (USF).<br />&bull; Rentable Square Feet (RSF) offered and rental rate per square foot, specifying services, utilities, and tenant improvement allowance included.<br />&bull; Common Area Factor used to determine the RSF.<br />&bull; Name, address, telephone number, and email address of authorized contact.<br />&bull; In cases where an agent is representing multiple ownership entities, written acknowledgement, and permission to represent multiple owners for the same submission</p>
<p>AUTHORIZED CONTACTS:<br />GSA is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in lease negotiations for this transaction. In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized officers and employees of the General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative CBRE, Inc.<br /><br />Interested parties should submit pertinent information to the tenant broker and the GSA Contracting Officer:</p>

<DESC>This proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority for FAR 6.302-1(c)  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all information received within fifteen days (15) after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District intends to specify the following manufacturers product in the Joint Special Operations University (JSOU), MacDill AFB, FL project in order to properly manage the high density customer work spaces required by USSOCOM-J6 in its new data center. USSOCOM requires a specified brand name, firm fixed price purchase order for; modular furniture from Haworth Modular Office furniture.  <br>    <br>   The US Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has experienced unprecedented growth since September 11, 2001.  The SOCOM compound has expanded with new buildings and routinely reorganizes to accommodate the evolving mission. Therefore, USSOCOM maintains an inventory of spare parts in order to rapidly accomplish frequent office reconfigurations as required.  Maintaining multiple types of inventories of systems furniture would create an additional space requirement as well as an increased administrative burden and cost.    <br>    <br>  USSOCOM also provides support to two local subordinate (component) commands.  They also use Haworth as the standard cubical furniture.  SOCOM's modular work stations' IT and electrical requirements were factored into the ultimate decision to utilize Haworth as the sole provider of modular workstations.    <br>    <br>  Firms interested in being considered shall provide manufactures name, product data and written statement of compatibility.  The written statement of compatibility shall include manufacturer backup information and support documentation.   Responses must be received fifteen (15) days after publication of this notice.   Responses should be addressed to:  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, ATTN:  Rosemary Hall:  CESAM-CT-C, P.O.

<DESC>1. The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville (CEHNC) is issuing this sources sought announcement in order to perform market research primarily to determine if firms possess the ability to execute the requirements of an anticipated formal solicitation with an estimated contractual capacity of $250M over five (5) years. This sources sought announcement is not a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Therefore, we invite any size business to provide a capability statement in response to this requirement. This announcement does not obligate the Government to award a contract, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any preparation costs. <br /><br />2. Scope and Authority. The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) is the world-class provider of high performance computing capabilities for the United States Department of Defense (DOD). CEHNC and HPCMP have formally teamed to establish a path forward for future HPCMP requirements. This sources sought announcement seeks to evaluate industry's ability to provide sustainable, state-of-the-art, HPC capability for the DOD research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) community. This capability will be introduced through a series of technology insertions (TIs) in direct support of the DOD HPCMP's mission - to accelerate the development and transition of advanced defense technologies into superior warfighting capabilities by exploiting and strengthening U.S. leadership in supercomputing, communications, and computational modeling. The HPCMP continues to enhance its ability to support DOD and the warfighter through the acquisition of balanced HPC systems for five (5) DOD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) and multiple Dedicated HPC Project Investments (DHPIs). The Government is interested in uncovering industry's ability to deliver balanced, commercially-available, production-grade HPC systems, which contain an appropriate combination of processor, memory, disk I/O, interconnect, and operating system (OS) capabilities in order to conduct complex, tightly-coupled, large-scale, scientific calculations. Salient system attributes include:
<p>&bull; A reasonably high byte to floating point operation (FLOP) count ratio (when comparing peak CPU memory bandwidth to peak CPU floating point capability),<br />&bull; 2GB to 3GB of memory capacity per computational core,<br />&bull; At least 50GB/s, 50GB/s, and 75GB/s of read, write, and full duplex bandwidth (respectively) between the compute and I/O subsystems for every 1,000 computational nodes in the system,<br />&bull; At least 20GB per core, 20GB per core, and 0.5GB per core of formatted usable disk storage for /work1, /work2, and /home (respectively),<br />&bull; A tightly integrated interconnect with <br />&nbsp; o Each link having at least 40Gb/s of network bandwidth <br />&nbsp; o An end-to-end latency that is less than 5&micro;s (five microseconds), <br />&bull; A well-tuned OS with low jitter.<br />If you are interested in this acquisition, please complete the market research survey attached to this sources sought announcement to facilitate the Government's formulation of an overall acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>3. The most applicable North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334111, Electronic Computer Manufacturing. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>4. Responses (i.e. market research surveys) must be submitted electronically to</p>
<p>Mark.W.Dillinger@usace.army.mil <br />Andrew.E.Cameron@usace.army.mil</p>
<p>All responses shall be received by 3:00 PM central time on 11 January 2013. Responses shall be no more than 15 pages (single spaced, front side only, no smaller than Times New Roman, 12 point font). Extraneous materials (brochures, manuals, etc.) will not be considered. Questions concerning this announcement shall be submitted in writing via email to Andrew Cameron, Contract Specialist, email address noted previously.</p>
<p>5. Your response to this announcement is not a request to be considered for a contract award. This sources sought announcement is not a request for proposal and does not obligate the government to award any contract. The Government does not intend to rank submittals or provide any reply to interested firms.</p>
<p>6. Registration at www.fbo.gov (the Federal Business Opportunities website) as an interested vendor for this sources sought announcement does not (in itself) qualify your company as a viable candidate to meet the requirements stated in this announcement. In order for the Government to assess your company's ability to execute the necessary requirements, please submit a market research survey in accordance with the posted announcement.</p>
<p>7. Industry Day. The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville (CEHNC) will be hosting an Industry Day to present the HPCMP's technology insertion (TI) requirements to interested vendors. Industry Day will be held on 15 Jan 2013 from 0900 to1200 at the following location:</p>
<p>Tom Bevill Center Room 275<br />550 Sparkman Drive<br />Huntsville, AL 35816</p>
<p>If you are interested in attending Industry Day, please provide the name and affiliation of each attendee to Andrew Cameron (email address noted previously). Due to limited space, CEHNC is requesting that you limit the number of visitors per firm to two (2) participants. Industry Day will be held at the Bevill Center which is part of the University of Alabama, Huntsville. There are no special security procedures since this is not a federally secured facility. The Government will not reimburse any cost associated with attending Industry Day.</p>
<p>FOR INDUSTRY DAY QUESTIONS</p>
<p>If your company has any questions that it would like to have addressed at Industry Day, please submit those questions to Andrew Cameron at andrew.e.cameron@usace.army.mil by 11 January 2012, 3:00 PM central time. CEHNC will have limited exchanges with industry regarding technical proposal requirements and source selection issues.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division in support of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) has award a firm fixed price contract on a sole source basis to Hills, Inc., located at 7785 Ellis Road, West Melbourne, FL 32904-1105, under the authority as prescribed in 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The requirement is for the fabrication of a Model LBS bi-component fiber melt extrusion unit designed for laboratory use to make small amounts of bi-component fiber from small quantities of polymer. The machine will be versatile and run fully oriented bi-component multi-filament yarns, mono-filament yarns, metal core, high temperature polymers, meltblown and spunbond webs using a wide variety of polymer types and a multitude of cross sections. Model LBS bi-component fiber extruder is a proprietary melt extruder that possesses unique spin beam/spin pack technology and performance characteristics. Hills' multi-component technology is based on the use of proprietary thin distribution plates in the spin pack which permits all types of spinnable multi-component fibers to be spun from the same spin pack and is unique only to Hills, Inc. Their multi-component technology allows for the ability to run a broader array of materials, lower deniers, and wider polymer ratios that cannot be achieved with conventional technology. This vendor is the sole source provider of this bi-component extruder and its component parts and no other product will meet the agency's requirements. <br>  <br> The Government synopsized this action on 12 October 2012 to satisfy the requirements of FAR 5.201.

<DONBR>-
<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE BRIDGE CONTRACT under the authority described at FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, to acquire information technology services for U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters, Programs and Resources, Technology Services Organization (TSO). The Government intends to award a sole source contract for the above services to:
<p>Computer Sciences corporation (CSC)<br />Navy and marine Corps technology Center<br />4045 Hancock Street,<br />San Diego, CA 92110</p>
<p>The proposed bridge contract action is for services, under NAICS Code 541511, for which the Government intends to solicit only one source. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B)).<br /><br />The Contractor is the sole source service provider for TSO. DURATION: This requirement will be for a 6 month base period and two one-month option periods. This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request for proposal. No solicitation document is available and telephone, fax, or e-mail requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is within the discretion of the Government.</p>
