Awarding a six-month contract to another source, at the same the GAO protestis under review, would result in substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delaysin fulfilling the Governments requirements and not allow for a sufficient phase-inperiod, thereby affecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays infulfilling ARCs requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intendsto solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Thepurpose of this action is to bridge the performance period between the end of the currentcontract, the adjudication of the GAO protest, completion of any resultant corrective,and phase-in of a new contract.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact IN WRITING to the identified point of contact not later than 4 PM PST on April29, 2010.

<DESC>The Forest Service has a requirement for Decommissioning of approximately 28.5 miles of National Forest System Roads.  The work includes watershed restoration items on the central portion of the Priest Lake Ranger District.  These items include obliterating existing roads by recontouring or partial recontouring of the original roadbed, and restoration of stream channels by removing associated fills, removing culverts and construction of gradient control structures.  The work may also include placing roads into long term storage by decompacting the surface and constructing water bars.  Additional work consists of construction of sediment basins and seeding, fertilizing and mulching.  

No formal pre-proposal site visit will be conducted but offerors are encouraged to visit the site.  Offerors are also encouraged to review Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.237-1, Site Visit (Apr 1984).  Failure of the Contractor to ascertain the nature, location, and conditions which affect the work will not relieve the contractor from the responsibility for successfully performing the work without additional expense to the Government.  The project is located in Bonner County of Idaho and Pend Oreille County of Washington. The project roads are spread out over a large geographic area.  In Idaho the roads are located in Townships 61 and 62 North, Range 5 West of the Boise Meridian.  In Washington the roads are located in Township 36 North, Range 45 East of the Willamette Meridian.  Refer to the vicinity map on the title sheet and sheets 29-34 of the plans for project location.  For additional information regarding the site, contact Brent Briggs at 208-765-7436 or Dale Fife at 208-765-7432.

The Service Contract Act does apply as well as the appropriate wage determination.  The period of performance will be June 30, 2010 through October 15, 2010.  

All responsible small businesses may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.  In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract. Lack of registration in the CCR on part of the offeror will render a proposal ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 888-227-2423 or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov//. 

The solicitation package is anticipated to be available electronically on or about 12 May 2010 with an anticipated closing date of 11 June 2010. 

NOTE: THIS PRE-SOLICITATION HAS A DUE DATE THAT IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THE OFFICIAL DUE DATE WILL BE INDICATED IN THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.

ARRA Requirement: The Awardee will be subject to Section 1512(c) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act which requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Funds under the awarded contract. These reports will be made available to the public.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a follow-on sole source contract for the Hubble SpaceTelescope (HST) mission operations, systems engineering, ground system maintenance andflight software development with the incumbent Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company(LMSSC), 7474 Greenway Center Drive, Greenbelt, MD, in order to maintain the health andsafety of the observatory through the next phase of its science mission. NASA/GSFC plans to award LMSSC a cost plus award fee contract pursuant to 10U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, with an estimated period of performance offive years. The proposed cost plus award fee contract will include conducting all elements of HSTmission operations (except science operations), and to perform systems engineering tasksrequired to properly maintain HST flight and ground systems. Mission operationsresponsibilities include safe and efficient control and utilization of the HSTObservatory, maintenance and operation of HST-unique facilities and equipment as well ascreation, maintenance, and utilization of HST operations processes and procedures.Critical systems engineering responsibilities consist of optimizing mission systemcapabilities to maximize HST operations effectiveness and science productivity. This isaccomplished by analyzing and resolving HST mission system anomalies, by developing,integrating, testing, and maintaining HST flight software, ground systems hardware andsoftware, and network infrastructure, and by operating and maintaining numerousHST-unique test facilities and systems. The unique familiarity of the LMSSC team with HST space and ground assets is an essentialkey to successfully achieving critical program goals. The LMSSC team has been HSTsmission contractor for nearly twenty years. Some of the teams members were involved inthe original development of HST, and a significant fraction of the team has more than tenyears of experience with HST. The LMSSC team developed the HST ground and spacecraftoperation systems as they exist today, and the LMSSC team is the only team withexperience operating them. LMSSC has acquired unique experience and extensive knowledgeresolving anomalies, developing workarounds, and modifying the procedures, techniques andapproaches used to operate an aging HST. The national asset nature of the HST missionestablishes a very high standard for the safe and correct conduct of operations and forthe maintenance of maximum science productivity. Only LMSSC possesses the detailed, unique, HST-specific knowledge needed to assure themost efficient HST operation possible. HST operations, processes, and procedures arehighly complex in comparison with newer, more sophisticated, and highly automatedsatellites. The level of expertise needed to operate HST goes far beyond providing theday-to-day actions of a flight operations team to monitor telemetry, playback sciencedata, and complete command uplinks to HST computers. The importance of the LMSSC teamowes to the irreproducible level of experience possessed by the systems engineers whomonitor the performance of the instruments and subsystems and can quickly recognize anon-nominal condition or engineering data that is trending abnormally. This expertiseextends to the intimate knowledge these engineers have of Observatory performancecharacteristics, which assists their exploration of new control modes, and subsystemmanagement techniques. This further extends to the extensive experience the team has withunique, high-fidelity models of spacecraft and mode performance that they have personallydeveloped which enable them to tune parameters and refine control algorithms quickly andeffectively. All of this knowledge and experience contributes to the high productivityand creativity that have sustained HST for two decades. This, in turn, contributes to theunparalleled success of the HST mission and provides a platform from which future workcan successfully be conducted. The experience and understanding gained from past,technologically challenging HST-specific work are critical to a high quality scienceoperation, and even more critical to meeting the HST Program goals and challenges thatlie ahead to achieve maximum observatory life and science operations. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 5:00pm EDT on May 11,2010.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Canberra Industries, Inc., of Meriden, Connecticut, for the acquisition of two 4-B Sealed Hand/Cuff/Foot Monitors to supplement the monitors currently being used in the NIST Center for Neutron Research.

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

NIST currently utilizes an inventory of eight Canberra hand and foot contamination monitors throughout the site.  Due to the expansion of the NIST Center for Neutron Research(NCNR) facility, two additional Canberra hand and foot contamination monitors are needed for this new additional space.  Adding two new Canberra monitors will allow NIST significant savings by avoiding orientation and training costs for 2500+ users and staff that would be necessitated by purchasing monitors from another source.  In addition, NIST has significant inventories of spare and replacement parts for the Canberra monitors, as well as tools and equipment specific to Canberra monitors.  Adding monitors to the NCNR from another manufacturer would be cost prohibitive.

Canberra Industries, Inc. is the only contractor who can provide the Canberra Sirius 4-B Sealed Hand/Cuff/Foot Monitors that meet NISTs requirements.  Therefore, Canberra Industries, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the required Canberra Sirius 4-B Sealed Hand/Cuff/Foot Monitors.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (Eastern) on May 12, 2010.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>It is the intention of the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIR WD), Life Cycle Environmental Engineering Branch to procure one (1) each next generation multi-axis high frequency dynamic test system on a full and open competition basis on a firm fixed price (FFP) contract.  The system will be used to augment future research, development, design, and reliability assessment work.  The system shall have the ability to excite a test object in three translational axes and three rotations simultaneously, with a controllable frequency band not less than 2 kHz.  The scope of supply shall result in a fully integrated and functional test system and ancillary components that will permit dynamic testing of an array of naval weapon systems.  Broadly, the scope of supply includes all engineering, production, factory acceptance testing (FAT), delivery, installation, commissioning, and training for the test system and ancillary components.  The test system shall have a payload mounting area approximately 24" x 24" and permit the installation of a test object weighing at least 50 lbs without requiring external load biasing supports.  The test system shall have at least +/- 0.5 inches of displacement with a preferred +/- 1.0 inches of displacement in each axis simultaneously, +/- 4 degree of rotation in each direction (pitch, roll and yaw) simultaneously and be able to achieve a velocity of at least 50 inches per second.  The test system shall have, at a minimum, 2,000 lbf in each axis.  The maximum force shall be applicable throughout the desired frequency band, limited only by the relationship between frequency, displacement, and velocity.
The test system shall have, at a minimum, a controllable and useable frequency band from 10 Hz through 2 kHz.  The test system will be delivered with an integral reaction mass, sufficiently sized to achieve at least 95% of the full exciter velocity to the bare table.   The reaction mass must exhibit very well damped response in the test band of interest, and this feature will be estimated through finite element analysis early in the design process.  The system shall include an isolation system to attenuate the forces transmitted into the intended facility foundation by 95% at any frequency above 7 Hz.  
Specific information to include a detailed Statement of Work shall be included in Solicitation N68936-10-R-0045 to be issued and posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online website at http://www.neco.navy.mil and FEDBIZOPS website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 20 May 2010 to close 30 days after the Request for Proposal issue date.  Delivery requirements shall be F.O.B. Destination China Lake, CA.  Award is scheduled to occur by 24 August 2010.  All responsible sources may submit a written proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  All responses must be submitted in writing to the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Code 210000D, Attn: Dustin Barros, 429 E. Bowen Road Mail Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108.

Northrop Grumman Corporation is and has been the sole developer of the RAMICS system since the competitive award of the RAMICS SD&D contract N00024-02-C-6324 in FY 2002.  This requirement is to provide post-delivery technical support of delivered RAMICS SD&D units. Given the complexity of the system and the level of system knowledge required to provide the post delivery support, Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the repairs, upgrades, and software modifications of the RAMICS SD&D units.  Unrecoverable duplicative costs and unacceptable schedule delays would result if award were made to any other source.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division intends to award a sole source purchase order to Autonomous Solutions Inc., DBA ASI, 990 North 8000 West, Peterboro, UT 84325-9758 for technical support in the development of a new system for deployment of the Navy's common neutralizer that includes enhanced system performance, incorporation of a standards based (ASE AS-4) Open Architecture, and development of autonomous behaviors.  The Operator Control Unit (OCU) utilized for this effort must be suitable for UUV control.  Prior efforts by NSWC PCD have taken MOBIUS; an OCU developed by Autonomous Solutions Inc (ASI) and adapted it for use by one of the UUVs used by the Navy.  This task will capitalize on those previous efforts and add additional UUV functionality.  This effort will build on the MOBIUS version Mobius Hercules v3.0.25956.  This version of MOBIUS, that the Government already owns license for, is ASI proprietary.  As it is proprietary, and license already owned by government, ASI is the only source able to affect any updates.  In addition to the above, one additional Mobius license is being acquired to support the increased efforts under the overall project.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Results will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  NAICS: 541330 PSC: R425.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>SUBSIDIZED AND TRANSITIONAL EMPLOYMENT DEMONSTRATION AND EVALUATION PROJECT
<SOLNBR>ACF31924
<CONTACT>Anita L Nearhoof, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone 301-443-5312, Fax 301-443-3238, Email anita.nearhoof@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of the DHHS, Agency for Children and Families (ACF) for a project entitled, Subsidized and Transitional Employment Demonstration and Evaluation Project.

Purpose:  The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and evaluate subsidized and transitional employment approaches for critical low-income populations, including welfare recipients, low-income non-custodial parents, prisoners re-entering the community, low-income youth transitioning to the labor force, low-income individuals with disabilities, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and English Language Learners. The project will examine strategies aimed at successfully transitioning individuals in the aforementioned target populations from short-term subsidized employment to unsubsidized employment in the regular labor market. These strategies will build upon approaches that have demonstrated empirical effectiveness in previous studies, test new and innovative interventions designed to demonstrate promising program components, and adapt to current policy environments at the federal, state, and local levels. Approaches of particular interest include employment programs that offer opportunities for substantive, productive work; strategies that couple work experience with wrap-around support services (e.g., child care assistance, skills training, job search assistance, career advancement services); strategies that incorporate pre-employment activities; and strategies that target specific low-income populations, including welfare recipients, low-income non-custodial parents, prisoners re-entering the community, low-income youth transitioning to the labor force, low-income individuals with disabilities, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and English Language Learners. Additional approaches may also be considered. The goal of this demonstration and evaluation is to increase our knowledge about the efficacy of programs aimed at helping target populations secure and maintain unsubsidized employment. The evaluation component of the project will utilize a random assignment design in up to seven sites in order to assess the effectiveness of a variety of interventions.  The project will begin with a short term analysis of  what is known about existing or previous approaches to subsidized employment and transitional jobs especially within the context of current TANF policies and requirements as well as recent efforts under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. 

The period of performance for this contract will be a base period of 2 years with 5 option periods, to be exercised at the discretion of the Government, through the Contracting Officer.

The RFP will be posted on FBO approximately 15 days after this notice is issued.  Only electronic copies will be available.  Proposals will be due approximately 60 days after the RFP is issued.  THIS IS ONLY A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).

The dredging area is located approximately 15 miles from the placement site.  The contractor is required to properly prepare the placement site prior to placing the dredged material in accordance with the contract requirements including the construction of new and/or reinforcement of existing containment dikes in the area designated for placement of the Albany Turning Basin sediments.  The designated placement area was previously used for placement of dredged sediments that contained elevated levels of PCBs.  Following completion of the Albany Turning Basin dredging, the contractor is required to place a minimum of two (2) feet of clean cover over the entire area designated for use for the Albany Turning Basin sediments even if the entire designated area is not used during the Albany Turning Basin placement operations.  The contract includes a designated Mandatory Excavation Area (MEA) that must be used for dike construction/reinforcement and covering contaminated material.  The Contractor is required to excavate a minimum of 100,000 cubic yards of material from the designated MEA.  If the entire mandatory excavation quantity from the MEA is not used in the site construction and placement of a clean cover, the remaining material to be excavated is required to be deposited at designated stockpile locations within the Houghtaling Island Placement Site.

Mitigating measures to address unacceptable settlement will have to be taken due to the presence of highly compressible soils within the project area.  A potential for methane gas beneath the proposed building site exists, and therefore a methane gas collection, venting, and detection system will be required as part of the site preparation.  Other sitework includes site utilities, grading, constructing new sidewalks and parking areas, landscaping, and the construction of a 120-foot communications tower.  A new emergency generator and fuel tank will also be supplied adjacent to the new building.  Mechanical and electrical systems include HVAC with DDC, plumbing, fire protection, power, lighting, telecommunications, fire detection and alarm.

The Government intends to include optional bid items in the solicitation to be awarded pending funds availability.  The work includes (1) demolition of a one story, approximately 21,000 SF building immediately adjacent to the site of the new building; (2) demolition of an approximately 1,200 SF building on site; (3) construction of approximately 1,200 LF of ornamental fence around the perimeter of the base; and (4) burying approximately 240 LF of overhead electrical and telecommunication lines near the entrance to the Base.

The design proposals shall incorporate energy efficient design and construction and shall include sustainable design features sufficient for the Contractor to obtain a silver rating by the U.S. Green Building Council LEED-NC Version 3.0.  

The estimated price range of this project is between $10M and $25M.  The USCG will be utilizing a two-phase Design-Build selection procedure.

For consideration on this project, the offeror, at a minimum, must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, in successfully and satisfactorily completing a project of similar size and scope, not necessarily design-build.  

The design of the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, life safety, or other engineering features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by architects and engineers registered in the State of Ohio to practice in the particular professional field involved.  This solicitation is restricted to small business concerns.  The Phase One solicitation will be available for download in FedBizOpps on or about 11 May 2010.

Phase Two participants will submit competitive past performance, technical, and price proposals as defined in the Phase Two solicitation. The Phase Two evaluation factors (Past Performance, Proposed Technical Solutions, Proposed Organization and Key Personnel, Management and Scheduling Approach, and Quality Assurance and Quality Control) are considered approximately equal to price.

<DESC>Department of Veterans AffairsCAI-FrederickSynopsis for Acquisition Workforce TrainingThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has authority under the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (Pub. L. no. 109-461, 120 Stat. 3433 (2006)) and Executive Order 13360 to establish special acquisition methods to increase contracting and subcontracting opportunities for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) and veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs).  In an effort to support this Act, the VA is pursuing a total set-aside solicitation for SDVOSBs and VOSBs for Acquisition Workforce Training.This solicitation is being synopsis accordance with FAR 5.201.  1.	Action Code:  P - Presolicitation Notice2.	Date:  February 25, 20103.	Year:  20104.	Contracting Office Zip Code:  217035.	Classification Code:  U008  Trng/Curriculum Dvlp6.	Contracting Office Address:Department of Veterans AffairsCAI-Frederick7485 New Horizon WayFrederick, MD  217037.	Subject:  Acquisition Workforce Training8.	Proposed Solicitation Number:  VA798-10-RP-00609.	Closing Response Date:  April 12, 201010.	Primary POC:  Lora GrossAlternate POC:  James Poe11.	Description:In April 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) published Policy Letter 05-01, Developing and Managing the Acquisition Workforce, which requires the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to develop, and the Chief Acquisition Officers Council (CAOC) to approve, a certification program for contracting professionals in civilian agencies that reflects common standards.  The goal of the certification program is to standardize the education, training, and experience requirements for contracting professionals, which will improve workforce competencies and increase career opportunities.The program mirrors, as closely as possible, the requirements that the Department of Defense established for its contracting workforce under the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act.  The program will be administered by each civilian agency, and FAI will conduct periodic reviews to ensure that the program is being managed consistently.  The certification shall be accepted by, at minimum, all civilian agencies as evidence that an employee meets the core education, training and experience requirements to be a contracting professional (generally the GS-1102 series).The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and the subsequently Office of  Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 05-01 (found at www.fai.gov ) require the heads of Federal agencies, through their Senior Procurement Executive, to define the education, training and experience necessary for career progression within the acquisition workforce job functions including mandatory coursework and on-the-job training.  Under the current law, individuals in the occupational series GS-1102 and those possessing a contracting officer's warrant regardless of their occupational series are required to meet certain baseline training and education requirements based on their grade.  In addition to the 1102 series, VA has expanded the definition of "acquisition workforce" to include Contracting Officer Technical Representatives (COTRs).  The VAAA's mission is to develop competency-based training programs for the VA's acquisition workforce to ensure acquisition excellence within the agency.  For the past two years, the VA has been developing classes for the acquisition workforce.  Based on lessons learned, they are seeking contractors to provide these acquisition training courses for FAC-C Certification, Contracting Electives and COTR, to better establish consistency, and create a more efficient process for procurement.A Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract will be awarded in accordance with FAR 12 and 15 for Commercial and Negotiated acquisition procedures.The anticipated period of performance is for a term of five (5) years.10.  Place of Contract Performance:  Performance will be predominantly at the VA Acquisition Academy (VAAA) in Frederick, MD.  There will be no reimbursement for local travel within the Washington, DC metro area.11.  Set Aside:  This acquisition will be negotiated on a total SDVOSB/VOSB small business set-aside basis.12.  Transmittal:    All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by VA.  This solicitation and any subsequent amendments will be posted to the FBO website:  https://www.fbo.gov/.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be posted to the FBO website on or about March 12, 2010 with proposals due by April 12, 2010.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals prior to offer due date.

<DESC>SynopsisThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), Eatontown, NJ 07724, intends to procure for the development of a Veterans Health Administration Patient Assessment System (PAS) that administers web-based patient self-assessment.  This effort will be procured as a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) sole source award under FAR 6.302-5, and VAAR 819.7007.  Development will be done in a test environment using deidentified or fabricated data.  It will not impact production environments or patient care.  This new PAS will be a flexible, web-based tool that provides data to the VA Mental Health Package (MHP), and through MHP makes it available to VistA-based systems that generate chart notes in CPRS for clinicians.  The project will require (1) a server-based PAS assessment system that (a) allows staff to design assessments, (b) serves these assessments nationally to kiosks running Internet Explorer, and (c) communicates assessment results to the medical center's MHP using HL-7; (2) a kiosk controller that runs on PC kiosks and communicates with (a) the PAS assessment system, and (b) the medical center's MHP using HL-7, and; (3) a MUMPS interface in the medical center's MHP that communicates with the PAS assessment system and kiosk using HL-7, and with VistA.  The contractor shall develop software that fully achieves the above functions.  This includes an operational system with excellent usability for staff and patients with chronic mental illness, and that meets functional requirements, VA security requirements, and is documented with source code.  This consists of software that is fully operational and class 1 compliant, with modifications deemed appropriate to achieve above requirements as the prototype is implemented at two VHA medical centers.  The scope of this contract does not include implementation into a production environment.The solicitation will be issued as a request for quote (RFQ) from the VA TAC, and the number assigned to it will be VA118-10-RQ-0156.  The associated NAICS code for this effort is 541511, with a small business size standard of $25M.  The proposed action will be a Firm Fixed Price contract, with a ten month base period with optional tasks extending an additional four months.  The place of performance shall be primarily at the contractor's facility, but also include performance at the VA facility in west Los Angeles, California, and coordination with VA medical centers in Long Beach CA, Greater Los Angeles CA, Pacific Islands Health Care System HI, Albany NY, VA Headquarters in Washington DC, and/or at other VA sites within the United States and other facilities selected by the VA.  The anticipated award date is June 2010.All proposal documents and communications shall be made available through the Contract Specialist, Mark Junda, via email at mark.junda@va.gov, or via telephone at 732.578.5428.

<DESC>Request for Information Spatial Disorientation (SD) Training Simulator/Device<br />to support Undergraduate/Joint Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training Syllabus
<p>1. Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is soliciting interest and capability statements for a competitive acquisition for a SD training simulator/device. For the purposes of this RFI, the device will be referred to as an SD simulator.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What's needed:</strong><br /></span>A commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) SD simulator that will be used to supplement Undergraduate/Joint Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training. The SD simulator will create typical vestibular and visual SD illusions typically found in textbooks and literature associated with SD in aviation. Some examples of the known illusions are a somatogyral illusion, the oculogyral illusion, nystagmus, autokinesis, the leans, a somatogravic illusion, the blackhole approach, false horizons, and runway width and/or runway slope illusions. Other illusions are welcome. AETC has spent considerable time and study into the characteristics of available COTS technologies. The following is a concise summary of our understanding the needs and technologies:</p>
<p>The visual display must be realistic of the aviation environment. This means the visual display must have a high enough resolution so that the scene environment looks and behaves similar to the actual aircraft visual information. In addition, the visual display itself must be collimated to replicate visual accommodation between distant objects and aircraft instrumentation. The motion platform used to generate the illusions shall be a true 6 degree-of-freedom hexapod motion cueing platform, similar to that used in FAA certified high-fidelity flight simulators. In addition to this motion requirement, the motion platform must be capable of producing continual yaw rotation through a variety of speeds. The physical construction of the SD simulator should be robust enough to mimic the cockpit environment but a low cost solution is desired. The device must support training for VFR (Visual Flight Rules) and IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) phases of flight. Seamless training from basic switchology used in flight training to SD training is required. We mean that SD illusions must be able to be embedded within the flight simulation capability and unexpected to the trainee. Cockpit controls should be representative of a generic cockpit and function in a representative manner. Cockpit instrument indicators should be produced on flat screen displays/multi-function displays that are easily maintained and replaced. Navigation and communication panels should be as realistic as possible. The displays should be driven by non-proprietary computer software and hardware which are easy to modify for different flight and environmental conditions. The computer driven displays should be easily swapped out in the event of display failure. A "Soft or less than 100% replication" of the cockpit/instrument environment is acceptable as our desire is to have low maintenance costs (Traditional Aircraft Gauges that require calibration are not intended). Navigation Area/Database does not need to represent the US Airspace system; rather, it must be able to represent terrain and weather features necessary to simulate the desired illusions. Approach capability (Navigation Database, Aircraft display (avionics), and communication) should include DME, ILS, and LOC). At least one runway that allows the instructor to make changes with respect to size, shape and slope are needed. These runway "feature" changes should be available to employ while flight is progressing, or when the aircraft flight is "frozen." This feature is needed for demonstrating changes in visual perception. The ability to pause the student training in flight at any time is also a requirement. Weather conditions must support both a wide range of VFR and IFR environments that could cause spatially disorienting conditions. A self-controlled 24 hour (day time through night time) visual display of the cultural and natural lighting is required. An Instructor Control Station (ICS) detached from the simulator is required in order to input changes to the scenario without student knowledge and to allow the student to experience illusions without the instructor present in the cockpit. Yaw input must be able to be made at the ICS while the trainee is flying the simulator in the normal flight simulator mode. The ICS should replicate actual student performance in the cockpit with 100% accuracy, be easy to read, but does not need to be representative of actual aircraft layout, i.e., an LCD display of aircraft gauges duplicated what the trainee sees is acceptable. The sounds experienced in the natural environment should be simulated to replicate those of the actual aviation environment, e.g., thunder, aircraft noise, radio chatter, and flight instruction. These sounds should be received over the pilot's headset. The simulator should support 10 hours of continuous use in a normal training environment. US Power compliance is required (110V or 240V).</p>

Belvoir, VA 22060.<BR> <BR><BR>Excerpt from GL-PD-08-09C<BR>ATTACHMENT 1 - TESTING REQUIREMENTS<BR><BR>4.6  Ballistic Performance.  <BR>4.6.1  Ballistic Testing.  General procedures and requirements are provided in 4.6.2 (see 6.4 for definitions).  First Article Testing will be conducted on 15 x 15 inch shoot packs of the proposed ballistic material system.  Lot Acceptance Testing will be conducted on the end item constructed of the approved ballistic material system (see 6.4).  Failure to meet the requirements of any sub-test will constitute failure for the entire First Article Test or Lot Acceptance Test.<BR>4.6.2  Conditions.  Dry specimens and specimens after wet, hot temperature, cold temperature, accelerated aging, and POL conditioning will be tested for ballistic performance as specified in 3.12.1.  The dry condition is the standard test condition specified in 3.12.2.  All specimens will be visually inspected after conditioning for coloration, distortion, melting, cracking, or other physical defects and noted.<BR>4.6.2.1  Wet Condition.  Sea water shall be utilized for wet test conditions.  The sea water formulation is 3% sodium chloride/0.5% magnesium chloride.  The wet condition is achieved by completely submerging the specimen in sea water at 70  5 degree F for 24 hours.  The specimens are submerged such that the fluid is in contact with all exterior surfaces to allow maximum fluid penetration.  A ten pound weight shall be placed on a 15 x 15 plate to distribute load to allow for maximum fluid penetration.  After submersion, excessive water will be drained from the specimen by hanging vertically for 15 minutes.  Ballistic testing of the specimen shall begin within 5 minutes of the completion of draining and shall be completed within 60 minutes.<BR>4.6.2.2  Temperature Extremes Condition.  For the hot temperature extreme, the sample shall be heated in an oven operating at 155 +/- 10 degrees Fahrenheit for 6  1/4 hours continuously.  The test specimen shall be removed from the oven, mounted and ballistically tested as specified in 4.6.2.  For cold temperature extreme, the test specimen shall be cold temperature exposed to -60 +/-10 degree F for 6 +/-  hours continuously.  The test specimen shall be removed from refrigeration, mounted and ballistically tested as specified in 4.6.2 within 5 minutes with tests completed within 60 minutes.  If the test is not completed within 60 minutes the specimen shall be reconditioned for at least 1 hour at the temperature specified above.<BR>4.6.2.3  Accelerated Aging.  Accelerated aging of the sample shall be performed in general accordance with ASTM D1149, with the following modifications.  The entire sample under test will be subjected to treatment.  A 30 lbs. weight will be applied to the sample during accelerated aging conditioning.  All samples will be conditioned for 72 hours at 40C while maintaining a minimum of 50 parts per hundred million of ozone.  The sample does not require any additional tensile strain during accelerated aging conditioning.  After accelerated aging conditioning, the sample must remain at ambient atmospheric conditions for 24 hours prior to ballistic testing.  Verify that the conditioned samples perform as specified in 3.12.1.<BR>4.6.2.4  POL Contamination.  The ballistic material system specimens shall be immersed in each of the following: motor oil at room temperature and gasoline at room temperature.  The motor oil shall conform to ASTM D-4485, Grade CD-II.  The specimens shall be placed flat in a pan with 1/8  1/4 inch of the POL fluid.  A ten pound weight shall be placed on a 15 x 15 platen to distribute load to allow for maximum fluid penetration.  The loaded specimen shall remain immersed for 4 hours at room condition.  The specimen shall be hung vertically to drip dry for 15 minutes, excess oil shall be wiped from the surface to facilitate handling of the specimen.  The specimen shall be ballistically tested within 30 minutes, with testing completed within 60 minutes.  If the testing is not completed within 60 minutes another specimen shall be conditioned as specified above and the testing shall continue with the second panel.<BR>4.6.3  V50 Ballistic Test Criteria.  For V50 Protection Ballistic Limits (BL), acceptance tests for the following minimum information is required by the government to validate performance:<BR>1) Armor specimen description including exact materials, thickness, sizes and weights of all components aerial density of armor system or ballistic system nomenclature.<BR>2) Conditioning of armor specimen.<BR>3) Test projectile with exact nomenclature.<BR>4) Temperature and humidity measurements.<BR>5) Yaw angle.<BR>6) Angles of target obliquity.<BR>7) Velocity measurements of each test shot used to test the armor.<BR>8) Velocity loss and/or corrected striking velocity.  Striking velocity shall be used for ballistic requirements.<BR>9) PP (Partial Penetration) and CP (Complete Penetration) next to each shot velocity as determined.<BR>10) Angle of spall/debris ejection if applicable.<BR>11) Name of company performing tests.<BR>12) Type of gun barrel, caliber, and propellant used<BR>13) Range measurements including distances from gun barrel to velocity measurement devices and target.<BR>14) Calculated Ballistic Limit. In a situation where the V50 BL data sheet would compromise the Security Classification Guide for Armor Materials, the data sheet should exclude the specific projectile used during testing.<BR>4.6.4   Projectile Velocity Determination.  Projectile velocity and time of flight measurements shall be in accordance with ITOP 4-2-805.  Instrumental velocity shall be translated into strike velocity at the target and the strike velocity shall be used for ballistic requirements.  Projectile velocity measurement methods shall employ either high velocity lumiline screens or electrical contact screens which either open or close an electric circuit by passage of the projectile through the detector.  Contact screens may consist of metallic foils separated by a thin insulating layer, or may consist of a circuit printed on paper with the circuit spacing such that the projectile passing through the screen will break the circuit. An electric counter type chronograph measuring to the nearest microsecond or as a maximum to the nearest 10 microseconds will be used with these measuring devices. As an alternative, radiographic equipment calibrated to capture the projectile at various time intervals of flight can be used. For fragment simulating projectiles, velocity correction methodology shall be used to calculate the actual striking velocity and, where appropriate, actual residual velocity.<BR>4.6.5  Weapon Mounting Configuration.  The spacing from the weapon muzzle to the first pair of triggering devices shall be sufficient to prevent damage from muzzle blast and obstruction from smoke in case optical devices are used. Recommended distances can be found in USATECOM TOP 4-2-805. Spacing between triggering devices is a function of the expected velocity of the projectile being fired. In many instances, physical restriction, such as short overall distance from muzzle to test sample dictates the spacing of the triggering devices. The last pair of triggering devices shall be placed at least four (4) feet (122 cm) in front of the test sample and should be protected from possible damage resulting from fragments.<BR>4.6.6   Environmental Test Conditions.   All ballistic tests shall be performed as closely as possible to a standard temperature of 68  10 degree Fahrenheit and 50  20 % relative humidity. Temperature and humidity measurements shall be recorded before the beginning of days test firings and every two hours thereafter.<BR>4.6.7  Projectile Yaw Determination.  Projectile yaw shall be measured for each firing by yaw cards, flash radiograph or photography. Any round for which yaw is determined to be greater than 5 degrees shall be disregarded in the calculation of the ballistic limit. The measurement system employed should be capable of measuring yaw within an accuracy of 0.5 degree.<BR>4.6.8  V50 Ballistic Limit (BL) Calculation.  V50 Ballistic Limits for First Article shall be determined using shootpacks representing the proposed ballistic system (see 6.6).   V50 Ballistic Limits for conformance testing shall be determined using Nape Pads selected from the presented lot (see 6.2).  V50 Ballistic Limit shall be determined in accordance with MIL-STD-662 and ITOP 4-2-805.<BR>	a.   First Article (Shootpacks).  Five (5) Partial Penetration (PPs) and five (5) Complete Penetrations (CPs) within a 150 ft/sec velocity spread yield the minimum allowable V50 BL determination that will be accepted as reliable test results.  If the velocity spread is not achieved, the test will be deemed inconclusive, therefore a contingency sample must be used.<BR><BR>b.  Conformance (Nape Pads).  The combined V50 ballistic limit shall be obtained by marking a left, right and center point of impact on each of a minimum of  twenty (20) Nape Pads in order to obtain 3 data points for each item tested.  Ballistic limit testing shall be conducted to obtain a total of 60 data points.  The combined V50 ballistic limit shall be calculated using all 60 individual left, right and center data points using an inverse prediction method.<BR>4.6.9  PP and CP Determination for V50.<BR>a. First Article (Shootpacks).  Complete and partial penetrations (see 6.4) will be determined based on the impressions left on an aluminum witness sheet. A 0.020 in. (0.051 mm thick 2024 T3 sheet of aluminum) will be placed 6 + 1/2 in. (152 + 12.7 mm) behind and parallel to the target. The aluminum witness sheet will be at least 15 x 15 in. size and be of sufficient size to capture all fragments resulting from the ballistic event, mounted rigidly around its parameter and placed so that the target impact location is approximately at the center of the aluminum sheet. Restraint is required during testing so that the material is not pulled through the ballistic test window frame. Unrestrained or improperly restrained materials will tend to pull down the projectile line of flight. Restraint provides for more accurate and reproducible data if uniformly applied. The following test conditions apply:<BR>- For all size test panels a metallic (approximately 0.20 inch thick aluminum or steel) frame with minimum 1.4 inch webbing shall be employed to restrain the test material during ballistic impact.<BR>- The test panel will be sandwiched between 2 frames and restrained with mechanical or pneumatic clamping devices at each of the four comers of the frame.<BR>- The restraining frames will be cut so that a ballistic window with minimum sizing of 12.0 x 12.0 inch square will be used.<BR> - The minimum size test panel that will be evaluated should be no smaller than 15 in. x 15 in.<BR>- No shots should be closer than 2.5 inch from any frame edge.<BR>- Since the fiber direction of both warp and fill are aligned in the 0, and +/- 90 degree directions from one layer to another, test shots should be staggered at least 0.75 inch off the horizontal and vertical lines of any previous shots.<BR>- Test shots shall be sufficiently spaced so that sequential shots are not influenced by previous impact areas. A minimum shot spacing of 2.5 inch is required but 3.0 inch is recommended, especially when testing against handgun projectiles.<BR>- Depending on the test panel size it may be necessary to use 2-3 panels for the V50 determination.<BR>- Samples can be reconditioned to initial shape after every shot, if desired, but this is not required due to the higher test costs and some materials may not require this action. At a minimum the test specimen shall be reconditioned when excessive pulling from the restraining fixture is exhibited. Excessive pulling as defined by the fabric extending greater than 2.0 inch beyond the original rear surface plan of the armor or the distance between the rear armor surface is within 4.0 inch of the witness sheet.<BR>b. Conformance (Nape Pads).  A complete penetration will have occurred when the projectile, fragment of the projectile, or fragment of the armor material is imbedded or passes into the clay backing material.  Fibrous materials that are emitted from the back of the test specimen and rests on the outer surface of the clay impression are not considered a complete penetration.<BR>4.6.10  V50 Test Sample Mounting.<BR>a. First Article (Shootpacks).  Restraint is required during testing so that the material is not pulled through the ballistic test window frame.  Unrestrained or improperly restrained materials will tend to pulled down the projectile line of flight.  Restraint provides for more accurate and reproducible data if applied consistently. Unless otherwise stated the following conditions shall be performed during V50 testing.  The armor test sample shall be secured on the test target mount with the impact side at the appropriate angle to the line-of-flight of the projectile.  The frame supports, clamps or mounting fixtures must be capable of retaining the sample and withstanding shock resulting from ballistic impact by the test projectiles.  The test sample mount shall be capable of adjustment of moving the sample in the vertical and horizontal directions so that the point of impact can be located anywhere on the sample and so that appropriate degree obliquity impacts can be achieved anywhere on the sample. The test sample mount shall be capable of rotating on the vertical or horizontal axis so that various obliquity attack angles can be achieved.<BR>b. Conformance.  The back of the armor test specimen will be attached to a block of non-hardening, oil-based molding clay so that no movement of the test samples occur before, during, or after the ballistic event.  The clay block (see 4.6.12) shall be rigidly held by a suitable (metal) stand. The armor test sample shall be secured in the vertical position, perpendicular to the projectile line of flight. The frame supports must be capable of retaining the sample and withstanding shock resulting from ballistic impact. The test sample mounting shall be capable of adjustment for moving the sample in the vertical or horizontal positions so that the point of impact can be located anywhere on the sample.<BR>- The first shot will be fired one at the center of the Nape Pad, the second shot to the right (or left) of center, and the third shot fired to the remaining side, (left or right) of center.  <BR>4.6.11  V0 Determination.  Instrumental velocity shall be translated into strike velocity at the target and the strike velocity shall be used for ballistic requirements.  For V0 or full protection (no complete penetrations), a minimum velocity (muzzle plus 50 ft/sec) will be the requirement.  The following conditions apply;  No complete penetration at the maximum specified shot pattern specified is the minimum requirement.  Closer positioning of shots without complete penetration is a desired requirement.<BR>- Test samples should be 15.0 x 15.0 inch square size panels and configured in the proposed final armor material system for the First Article Testing Only (see 6.6).<BR>- Samples will be mounted on clay block described below (see 4.6.12).<BR>- The first shot will be 2.75 0/+1/4 inch from any edge.<BR>- The next shot shall be located 3.5 inch 0/+1/2 from the first shot and at the weakness point in the configuration, e.g.; seamed area or non-uniform area of design.<BR>- The third shot location should be positioned 3.5 inch 0/+1/2 from any of the 2<BR>previous test shots.<BR>- The fourth and fifth shots shall be located 3.5 inch 0/+1/2 from any previous test shots and tested at 30 degrees obliquity.<BR>- The transient deformation shall be measured (see 4.6.12) after the third and fifth test firings<BR>- Test shots should be staggered at least 0.25 inch off the horizontal and vertical lines of any previous shots.<BR>- Test specimens shall be reconditioned to a smooth shape after every shot.<BR>4.6.12  Transient Deformation Measurement.  The back of the armor test specimen shall be attached to a block of non-hardening, oil-based molding clay so that no movement of the test samples occur before, during or after the ballistic event.  The clay material shall be in the form of a single block at least 4.0 in. thick and 24 x 24 in. length and height.  The clay backing material shall be conditioned in its fixture, using a heated chamber or enclosure.  Conditioning time, temperature, and corresponding drop test performance may change as a function of backing material age and usage. Actual conditioning temperature and recover time between uses will be determined by drop test results. Additional clay, conditioned to the same initial temperature as the fixture, shall be used to fill voids and restore the front surface of the backing material as needed.  The clays consistency should be such that depression of 25 + 3 mm (1 + 0.1 in) in depth is obtained when a 1 kg + 10gm (2.2 lb + 0.35 oz) cylindrical steel mass, 44.5 + 0.5 mm (1.75 + 0.02 in) in. diameter and having a hemispherical striking end is dropped from a height of 2 m + 2 cm (6.5 + 0.07 ft) onto one of its square faces.  The specimen will be strapped or taped to the surface of the clay material.  Ballistic testing will be performed at 0 degrees obliquity and 30 degree obliquity.  Back-face deformations in the clay will not exceed 44 mm when measured from the original undisturbed surface of the backing material to the lowest point of the depression.  The specimen may be smoothed between shots.  BFD measurements will be taken utilizing a certified, calibrated laser scanner measurement instrument, which provide a means to accurately measure the difference between the original undisturbed clay surface and the deepest point of BFD signature. The perpendicular distance between the original surface and the deepest point of depression, with reference to the original undisturbed surface, will be measured after the test record shot impact. The laser scanner measurement instruments shall be certified by ATEC and use a software package capable of meeting the following requirements:   Uniform sample: 0.5mm, noise reduction: Data with 0.05mm limit on point movements, wrap points with polygonal surface (without noise reduction), data smoothing: fill holes (curvature based on hole filling), removal of intersecting triangles, spike removal: 10% (run 2 times in a row), 3D: comparison to determine the deepest point.  The software package shall ensure the deepest point is not located within a crack in the clay. If a crack in the clay is determined to be the deepest point, the software smoothing function will fill-in the crack and find the actual deepest point. The software shall also ensure that the area identified as the deepest point is has a minimum area of at least 0.7 mm x 0.7 mm in width and length.<BR>4.6.12.1 Test Sample Mounting.  The molding clay block shall be rigidly held by a suitable (metal) stand. The armor test sample must remain coplanar throughout the test and shall be secured in the vertical position, perpendicular to the projectile line of flight.  The frame supports must be capable of retaining the sample and withstanding shock resulting from ballistic impact.  The test sample mounting shall be capable of adjustment for moving the sample in the vertical or horizontal positions so that the point of impact can be located anywhere on the sample and rotation on the vertical axis so that 0 and 30 degree obliquity impacts can be achieved anywhere on the sample<BR><BR>

<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) requirement for equipment and services to upgrade a core ER spectrometer system by integrating new and reconditioned electronic modules with existing equipment to remove baseline drift, improve sensitivity, reduce noise problems, provide improved field range and homogeneity, and provide computer control of sample temperature to create a state-of-the-art X-band ER spectrometer with capabilities that exceed systems currently on the market at a fraction of the cost. Summit Technology is the only vendor known to have the necessary specialized experience in the design of new equipment, the extension of existing equipment with new capabilities, and the refurbishment of older equipment, and is willing to work with NIST to refurbish and integrate older equipment with their own new electronic modules in order to achieve a cost savings while still producing a state-of-the-art system. Delivery date shall be 60 days ARO.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY

This is a Sources Sought Notice and does not constitute a commitment by the Government.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10, to identify potential sources to provide the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market.  All information submitted in response to this sources sought notice is voluntary and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.  Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately.  All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is pursuing multiple and parallel strategies to close the gap between current antiviral drug supply and the HHS goal of stockpiling approved agents and developing new antiviral agents as part of the strategic plan for pandemic preparedness.  HHS is particularly interested in the advanced development of new influenza antiviral agents or drug candidates effective against influenza designed to target novel mechanisms of action or to enhance effects of present classes of influenza antiviral drugs, formulated for long term stability, long bioavailability, and simple dosing regimens.  Ultimately, these influenza antiviral agents shall be produced at one or more Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed domestic manufacturing facilities and shall provide sufficient surge capacity to contribute substantially to U.S. and ideally global antiviral needs during an influenza pandemic. 

Respondents must meet the following mandatory qualification criteria:

1.	Demonstration of Advanced Development/U.S. Influenza Antiviral Agent Licensure/Approval 

It is essential that efforts funded subsequently shall lead to U.S. licensure/approval of an influenza antiviral agent that can be used to protect the U.S. population in the event of an influenza pandemic.  The Respondent must demonstrate significant progress towards development of an antiviral drug or biologic (not vaccines) by documenting the submission of an IND and completion of a final report, reviewed by the Respondent, of Phase I clinical trials for safety by the time of contract proposal submission.  Drug efficacy must be based on either of two criteria:  demonstrable ability to inhibit virus replication/spread, or demonstrable ability to produce an accelerated reduction of disease symptoms, including but not limited to a reduction of morbidity and mortality.

2.	U.S. Drug Manufacturing 

To provide U.S-based facilities, the Respondent may be a 1) single, fully integrated and independent pharmaceutical company, 2) partnership of a prime contractor with legitimate subsidiary or corporate partner that performs U.S based drug manufacturing and/or clinical studies, or 3) consortium with the Respondent as the prime contractor with subcontractors such as contract manufacturing organizations and/or contract research organizations as members that perform U.S. based drug/biologic manufacturing and/or clinical studies. 

3.	Production Capability

The Respondent must demonstrate sufficient production capacity to satisfy U.S. Government needs in the event of a declared influenza public health emergency.

The Government is seeking qualified small business concerns and seeks to obtain information regarding:  (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, veteran-owned small business , 8(a) small business, woman-owned small business or small disadvantaged business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 325414.  The small business size standard for this NAICS code is 500 employees.  Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy, including whether or not a set-aside is possible.  Teaming arrangements are encouraged.  Large businesses may also respond to this notice.  Potential respondents are requested to include whether they are a large or small business.

Respondents to this sources sought notice may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement, including a response to the requested information above, how they plan to meet the mandatory qualification criteria, an anticipated development plan of the product, and primary contact information at the organization (name, email address and telephone number) in the event HHS has additional questions or requires clarification of the submitted information.  Responses are limited to twenty (20) pages and must be submitted to the contact person listed below.  

It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be announced at the end of May 2010 with proposals due a minimum of forty five (45) days after RFP issuance.  While the mandatory qualification criteria do not have to currently be met, all of the mandatory qualification criteria must be met by proposal submission.  Proposals that do not meet the mandatory qualification criteria would not be considered for evaluation.

All responses to this Sources Sought Notice shall reference Sources Sought Notice Number:  10-100-SOL-00016.  Responses are to be submitted to Mekeba Barrett by 2:00 PM ET, May 10, 2010 at mekeba.barrett@hhs.gov.  

Any questions or comments relating to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted electronically to mekeba.barrett@hhs.gov.

<CONTACT>Robert Daniel Dague, Contracts Specialist, at robert.dague@usmc.mil
<DESC>PM TRASYS, Combat Vehicle Training System (CVTS) - LAV and AAV Driver Training Systems and AAV TT Enhanced Gunner's Weapon Station
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:The United States Marine Corps (USMC), in order to meet the gunnery training requirements established in the Operational Readiness Document (ORD) dated 16 Jan 2002, procured the Advanced Gunnery Training System (AGTS) and the Assault Amphibious Vehicle Turret Trainer (AAV TT) to meet the crew gunnery training requirements for the LAV and AAV Community respectively.  The USMC has identified the need to: (1) incorporate the vehicle driver into each of the LAV AGTS and AAV-TT gunnery trainers (by improving the existing capability) to help maintain critical skills for the entire vehicle crew, (2) to enhance the current AAV TT gunner's weapon station to provide a more realistic gunnery capability, and (3) to enclose the AAV TT into a self-contained, climate-controlled shelter.
NEED:In order to meet additional training requirements for the LAV and AAV crew and section gunnery, PM TRASYS, Combat Vehicle Training System (CVTS) is looking for three separate driver trainer efforts: (1) to improve the current driver's station capability for the LAV AGTS systems, (2) to improve the current driver's station capability for the AAV-TT to allow for more realistic crew coordination and gunnery training, and (3) to procure four (4) full motion six (6) degree of freedom Driver Trainers for the USMC LAV-25.  
PM TRASYS, Combat Vehicle Training System (CVTS) is looking for two additional AAV TT efforts:  (1) to provide an enhancement to the AAV TT gunner's weapon station to include an Out-of-the-Hatch (OTH) view on top of the existing AAV TT, and (2) to enclose the AAV TT (to include the OTH view) into a self-contained, climate-controlled shelter similar to the LAV AGTS systems. 
OBJECTIVES:  The contractor shall develop, integrate and fabricate twenty (20) LAV-25 driver's stations into the current USMC LAV-25 AGTS baseline. The contactor shall develop, integrate, and fabricate sixteen (16) AAV driver's stations (with OTH views) and Gunner's OTH views on top of the existing AAV TT. The contractor shall develop, integrate, and fabricate sixteen (16) climate-controlled shelters and place each of the sixteen (16) enhanced AAV TT's into its own dedicated, self-contained shelter. The contractor shall develop, integrate and fabricate four (4) full motion fidelity [six (6) degree of freedom (6Dof)] LAV driver stations. 
All vendors with an appropriate product relating to the objectives are invited to submit a Capability Statement.  Capability Statements should discuss the products' capabilities against potential requirements, the products' system requirements, and any other relevant information that would enhance the Government's understanding of the information submitted. 
This is a Request for Information (RFI), not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  Written response is requested within 30 days after publication of this notice.  
NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<p>NSN: 8105-00-NIB-1309<br />Name: Can Liner, Low Density<br />Description: Can Liner, Low Density, Gusset Cut, Clear, 12x8x22, .80 Mil LLDPE 12x8x22 .80 Mil LLDPE</p>
<p>NSN: 8105-00-NIB-1322<br />Name: Can Liner, Low Density<br />Description: Can Liner, Low Density, Star Seal, Clear, 24x33", 1.00 Mil LLDPE</p>
<p>NSN: 8105-00-NIB-1323<br />Name: Can Liner, Low Density<br />Description: Can Liner, Low Density, Star Seal, Clear, 33x44", .95 Mil LLPDE</p>
<p>NSN: 8105-00-NIB-1324<br />Name: Can Liner, Low Density<br />Description: Can Liner, Low Density, Star Seal, Clear, 40x48", 1.50 Mil LLPDE</p>
<p><br />Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the Department of Veterans Affairs National Acquisition Center in Hines, IL.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the VA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>None Reported</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the VA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the VA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than May 11, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC><p>The 10th Contracting Squadron, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado has received a Sole Source justification for the requirement to purchase an upgrade to the existing 41cm telescope for the US Air Force Academy (USAFA) Department of Physics (DFP) at the USAFA observatory to support the Department of Physics course in space situational awareness to DFM Engineering at 1035 Deleware Ave. Unit D, Longmont, CO 80501-6155. <br />This acquisition will be done in accordance with FAR 12 and 13 procedures.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 333314 and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The DFP requires an upgrade to its existing DFM Engineering 41cm telescope system that fully supports remote, autonomous operations for satellite tracking at low earth orbits. The upgraded 41cm telescope requires a new equatorial mount system that has on-axis absolute encoders, harmonic speed reducers in the secondary drive that will provide zero backlash, and motor driven and remotely controlled mirror doors. The existing optics will require re-coating and the optical tube assembly will need to be modified to accommodate the wiring, cables and motor drive chassis of the new mounting system. The new chassis will be compatible in size to the current chassis for the USAFA 61cm telescope easing the burden of maintenance due to compatible telescope control system spares. The current DFM telescope control system must include all soft switches for remote control. The current DFM Engineering Sat Track function requires improvements by utilizing a GPS based time card in the TCS computer, and implementation of velocity feedback and integrator to the software servo in TCS. The secondary focus also requires a driver that is compatible with Focus Mas.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT submit a bid/quote at this time.</p>
<p>Any offerors believing they can provide the 41cm telescope upgrade requirement described above may provide evidence for consideration. Evidence must support the offeror's claim. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement can be conducted. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Responses must be received NLT 3:00 p.m. MST on 3 May 2010. Responses received after this will be considered late IAW FAR 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement. Contractors must have a current registration with the Central contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and with Online Representations and Certifications application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY TAS::14 1035::TAS RECOVERY MORA PMIS 72360 The National Park Service intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed price contract to Saybr Contractors, Inc., 3852 South 66th Street, Tacoma, Washington 98409 for  construction and renovation at the Sunrise Visitor Center, Mount Rainier National Park, related to the installation of new permanent park exhibits. Work includes flooring removal and renovation, possible flooring salvage operations, and partial replacement of existing flooring (two layers of flooring), design and construction of cabinets and visitor information desk, millwork fabrication, door work and replacement.  This project will be partially or wholly funded from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and the contractor must meet all reporting requirements of ARRA as described in FAR 52.204-11 (MAR 2010 Deviation), Section 1512 of ARRA, and other reports as required by law or regulation, additional information may also be found at www.federalreporting.gov
The acquisition has been offered to and accepted by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the 8(a) Program and will be negotiated and awarded to Saybr Contractors as a non-competitive award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, FAR Part 19.8. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code assigned to this project is 236220 Addition, alteration and renovation general contractors, commercial and institutional buildings with a corresponding small business size standard of $33.5M. The magnitude of this construction project is estimated between $100,000 and $250,000. This is not a request for competitive proposals and is published for the purpose of providing public notification. 
JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS SOLE SOURCE ACTION
1. Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity: Department of Interior, National Park Service, Pacific West Region, Mount Rainier National Park, action awarded through North Cascades National Park, Sedro-Woolley, WA 98284.
2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: The National Park Service, North Cascades National Park, intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract for construction and renovation work as identified in this announcement in accordance with FAR 19.8 and 41 U.S.C. 253(C) (5) to Saybr Contractors of Tacoma, Washington. 
3. A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value: Construction and renovation at the Sunrise Visitor Center, Mount Rainier National Park, related to the installation of new permanent park exhibits. Work includes renovation, possible salvage operations, partial removal, and partial replacement of existing flooring (two layers of flooring), design and construction of cabinets and visitor information desk, millwork fabrication, door work and replacement. The place of performance is in Pierce County Washington. The estimated magnitude of the construction project is between $100,000 and $250,000.
4. An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (5) and FAR 19.8, the U.S. Small Business Administration 8a small and disadvantaged business program.
5. A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: Saybr Contractors is a Small Business Administration certified small and disadvantaged business with extensive construction experience at Mount Rainier. Saybr has performed numerous projects at Mount Rainier National Park, all have been satisfactory.  The Sunrise Visitor Center is located at 6400 feet and no access to the jobsite is available this time of year without the use of helicopters and/or snowmobiles, the area is prone to snowstorms, blizzard conditions, and avalanche risk. Due to the aforementioned factors, conducting any form of group site visit is impractical and could be dangerous. Normal road access to Sunrise VC, for the purpose of a competitive site visit, is not anticipated until June, this would not allow sufficient time to solicit and award a contract for performance this year.  This would also delay the opening of the exhibits.  Additionally, this would not allow expenditure of the ARRA funded money within the timeframe designated for expenditure of funds (all requirements of law are being met and this action is in full compliance with acquisition regulations). Saybr has direct experience at Mount Rainier, direct experience working in remote locations, and direct experience in forecasting the costs related to performing the work at Mount Rainier.

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies: Soliciting a single offer from a SBA certified small disadvantaged business is authorized through the SBA 8a Program at this dollar threshold. A synopsis for SBA approved 8a actions at this dollar threshold is normally not required. This ARRA funded action is synopsized to promote maximum transparency of expenditure of ARRA funds.
7. A Determination by the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable: Saybr Contractors has a long history of cost efficient and satisfactory performance at Mount Rainier NP. Saybr has direct experience at Mount Rainier, direct experience working in remote locations, and direct experience in forecasting the costs related to performing the work at Mount Rainier NP. Saybr Contractors recently submitted the lowest price on a competitively awarded proposal for remote work at Stehekin, Washington and was subsequently awarded the contract.  NPS utilizes Architects and Engineers to develop and estimate construction costs prior to solicitation issuance and negotiation of the final contract amount to insure fair and reasonable pricing.
8. A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market research was conducted by the Contracting Officer at North Cascades National Park and by the Program Personnel at MORA to verify the aforementioned factors are accurate. 
9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302-2 (9) (i) - (iii) for some examples): N/A
10. A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: N/A
11. A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required: Award of this action is in accordance with all laws and within all guidelines of Federal Acquisition Regulations and based upon the aforementioned factors is in the best interest of the Government.

Description of the Effort: USASMDC/ARSTRAT requires a contractual vehicle that will fulfill a gap in ability to design, develop, demonstrate and integrate products focused on the force development of space, missile defense and high altitude capabilities that enable the Army Warfighter to effectively support USSTRATCOM, other Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies in the mission areas of Strategic Deterrence, Global Strike, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), Cyberspace, and Information Operations and other requirements.  The USASMDC/ARSTRAT D3I Program goals and objectives are to acquire the capability to formulate concepts and to design, develop, produce, modify, test, deliver and sustain space, cyber and, missile defense technological advancements in the form of architectures and systems to support DoD, Department of Army (DA), USASMDC/ARSTRAT, USSTRATCOM and our allies and other customer efforts supporting technology development within the USASMDC/ ARSTRAT mission areas.  The D3I Program will provide USASMDC/ARSTRAT and its customers with the ability to procure a broad range of missile defense, space and other applicable warfighter solutions in support of developmental and operational requirements.  The overarching program requirements provide D3I solutions that include, but are not limited to, design, development, demonstration and integration of future capability gap architectures, technologies, test and evaluation, assessments, integration and operations capabilities.

The contractor will provide five (5) new coveralls per assigned individuals at the beginning of the contract period for initial issue.

<p>3. In addition, we are also soliciting a quote for an additional optional buy of up to 130 CF-19 Toughbooks. These may be purchased as funding becomes available. Therefore, all offerors shall propose any quantity discount(s) available, and what the minimum order is to receive any quantity discount. This additional purchase will be placed as an option in the ensuing contract. The contractor shall propose a delivery schedule (in days/weeks after award format) for the optional Toughbooks.</p>
<p>4. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is incorporated and the Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. As indicated on the attached Standard Form 1449, award will be made on the basis of a simplified trade-off. In this instance, technical selection criteria will be of greater importance than cost. The Government will also evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s) and general statements that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well-known techniques will be used, or paraphrases of the RFP specification in whole or in part will not constitute compliance with this requirement concerning the content of the technical requirement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>This project will involve the purchase and installation of a dome frame roof on approximately 7 feet high by 1 foot thick ( this thickness tapers at the top to 9 inches), and approximately 30 feet long concrete walls. The old wooden roof was destroyed by this year snow storms leaving the salt and sand pits unprotected from the elements. This project will perform remedial protection until the new facility maintenance complex is completed. The proposed area has 6 columns 10 6 tall and 19 by 19. These columns except one support the 7 walls in a U shape. The distance between the left and right walls is 38 feet and 8 inches wide as measure from the inside. The length of the walls from the front to rear columns is 27 feet and 9 inches long. This dome frame roof must provide ample height ((at least 25 including the height of the walls) and extraordinary clearance for ease of movement, loading and handling of material by Front end Loaders and Dump Trucks. There must be no internal columns to interfere with vehicles or equipment in this salt sheds. This structure is to provide inclement weather and freezing conditions protection and to keep material dry and easy to work with. Wet, caked material is difficult to handle and lengthens the distribution process. Please see attached Solicatation, Statement of Work and Attachhments for further details.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION  -  This notice is provided for Information Purposes Only. This opportunity is available only to the Contractors that have an existing IDIQ contract.
The Department of Energy, Golden Field Office has a requirement from within the Department to conduct Energy Savings Performance Contract site reviews to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions as well as guaranteed savings.  The work funded by this RFQ is within the scope of the existing Project Facilitator IDIQ contracts which were awarded to multiple small business set-aside contractors, after full and open competition.  This procurement is for a Task Order to be issued as a competitive award with the competition limited to the existing Project Facilitator IDIQs.  The award will be on a time and materials basis as the uncertainties involved in performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price method.  The award will have a five (5) month base period, with no options, for a total of five months.  The Project Facilitator is in support of the DOE's Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) and includes consultation  and facilitation of energy savings projects.

<CONTACT>Mary Rose A. Nicol, Contract Specialist, Phone 3018277183, Email MaryRose.Nicol@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC><p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) mission statement states that the FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. It has been said by FDA leadership that fundamentally, FDA is an intellectual enterprise engaged in the business of managing information.</p>
<p>FDA requires a continuation of the contractor services providing facilitation, coaching, and business consulting services in support of the Office of White Oak Services (OWOS). The contractor has experience and is very familiar with the mission/vision of the OWOS and similar organizations within FDA.</p>
<p>In support of its mission and business objectives, the FDA Office of the Commissioner (OC), Office of Management (OM) reorganized the Office of White Oak Consolidation and the Office of Real Property Services/Division of Logistics Services and Facilities Operations into the newly established Office of White Oak Services (OWOS). The Office of Management has restructured the decentralized construction, relocation, facilities operations and logistics development and support elements into a more centralized structure which is reflective of today's best practices.</p>
<p>The centralized OWOS has been in place for approximately 20 months and OWOS leadership would like to obtain feedback from staff on what is working well and not working well in the organization as well as suggestions for improvement through a variety of avenues. OWOS seeks continuation of assistance in facilitation services, coaching, strategic planning, material development (i.e., meeting agendas, presentations, communications to staff, survey development, survey results compilation, meeting minutes, etc.).<br />.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-30.</p>

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to issue a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) to procure Tri-band System Spares and Training to Global SATCOM Technology, Inc (Global SATCOM). NGA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NGA's current communications architecture relies on the GlobalSatcom TR-1800-TT Tri-band SATCOM systems. Consequently it is necessary to maintain this architecture and procure the spares from Global SATCOM identified below to avoid any communication interruptions:

<p>Further, Global SATCOM is the only provider of the TR-1800-TT system training course. This is the only training course that is based exactly on the system configuration already fielded. No other training course is able to meet the NGA's requirement to provide training on the current configuration already fielded.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement. Telephone requests will not be considered.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is being procured using full and open competition.  

BACKGROUND
The required equipment shall be utilized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology/Synchrotron Methods Group.  The mission of the Synchrotron Methods 
Group is to develop and implement instrumentation related to synchrotron measurement.  

The vertically collimating mirror (VCM) is an essential optical element of the NIST spectroscopy/diffraction beamline.  The spectroscopy/diffraction beamline is being developed for a three-pole wiggler (3PW) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS)-II.  The VCM will use the NSLS-II three-pole wiggler (3PW) as its source and will be upstream of an existing NIST-owned double crystal monochromator (DCM).  This is a beamline for X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction.

The standard mode of operation for the beamline will be with Si(311) crystals in the DCM and an operating range of 4.5 keV to 40 keV.  NIST may consider windowless, tender-energy operations down to 2.1 keV in the future.  This should be considered when developing the design.  

Reference documentation to NSLS-II beam properties, including the properties of the 3PW, can be found at http://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/project/source_properties.asp. Other information related to NSLS-II or the 3PW source can be obtained from the NSLS-II project.

The VCM is intended to condition the divergent, broad-band radiation produced by a NSLS-II 3PW for optimal performance for both spectroscopy and diffraction.  

The VCM must be capable of collimating throughout the energy range, however the ability to adjust the reflecting angle and thus the acceptance aperture at lower energies in order to maximize throughput is required.  

Fixed exit of the beam from VCM or from the first optical enclosure is not a requirement of the mirror system.  This will  require a mirror of sufficient width to support two coatings.

It is noted that the NSLS-II is currently under construction and is anticipated to be completed not later than December 2012, however, this timeline is subject to change.  The VCM will be delivered and installed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Building 725, Upton, NY, however, will ultimately be moved to the NSLS-II site upon completion of construction.

FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40.</p>
<p>1352.215-73 INQUIRIES (MAR 2000)<br />Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the Contract Specialist. They must be received no later than seven (7) calendar days after the date of this solicitation.

Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430. This acquisition cannot be conducted as a small business set aside because there is no U.S. Small Business Administration waiver to the non-manufacturer rule for NAICS code 423430. This requirement is being competed under unrestricted full and open competition whereby IBM-authorized resellers/business partners will be the potential offeror base.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3, and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a)(1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because the user does not interact with the EIT product directly.</p>
<p>The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) currently runs a production environment for the Commerce Business Systems (CBS) software suite, which provides core financial, personnel, property, and travel database and application support to NIST and the Department of Commerce Office of the Secretary. These applications are deemed critical to the operation of the agency. The NIST CBS environment consists of IBM p Series servers, and IBM AIX and HA/CMP operating environments. The IBM AIX operating environment requires hardware, microcode, and device drivers that are proprietary and only available from IBM.</p>
<p>This requirement consists of the Contract Line Items below, as described in the attached spreadsheet. Quotations shall be tailored to the exact items listed. The Contractor shall provide:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: Power7 Server (configuration described in attached spreadsheet)<br />CLIN 0002: Power7 Server (configuration described in attached spreadsheet)<br />CLIN 0003: XIV Storage (configuration described in attached spreadsheet)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide for all shipping, labor, cables, components, interfaces, hardware and software necessary to upgrade the CBS pSeries AIX HA/CMP platforms and obsolete SSA drawers. The new hardware and software must be covered by at least a 3 year, 24x7 IBM support/warranty. All existing media interfaces (network, etc.) hardware devices, software licenses, including HA/CMP licenses and component configuration information must be transferred to the devices. Existing components such as cabling, HMC's, and SFs, where feasible, may be reused.</p>
<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br />The NIST CBS environment currently consists of IBM p Series servers, and IBM AIX and HA/CMP operating environments. The IBM AIX operating environment requires hardware, microcode, and device drivers that are proprietary and only available from IBM. The capacity upgrade must adhere to the current architecture for compatibility; therefore only IBM p Series hardware and AIX operating environments are acceptable. <br />All responsible offerors that are IBM-authorized resellers/business partners are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below. All products quoted must be in the IBM support database so that support must come from IBM personnel.</p>

Included as part of each resume, the offeror shall identify each individual's knowledge of, and experience with, IT security requirements. If an offeror has not yet identified one or more individuals for one or more Items (or Option Items), the offeror shall identify the qualifications that it expects will be possessed by the individual(s) which it will provide for the Item (or Option Item) along with the hours for the individual(s) and a discussion as to how and where the offeror will find the individual(s) possessing such qualifications.

<p>The following Statement/Information is in reference to this Acquisition being considered to be a Sole Source Acquisition based on the following as provided to the Contracting Officer and hereby agreed upon.</p>
<p><br />Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition. JOTFOC</p>
<p>(a) Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information: <br />(1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition."</p>
<p>USCG Command and Control Engineering Center(C2CEN), Core Technologies, <br />Navigation Sensors Section (CT-N2). Located in Portsmouth Va.</p>
<p>(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>Type-B certification program for twenty persons on the topic of the installation and inspection of shipboard cable. Training is broken down into classroom sessions and hands-on instruction with both a written and hands-on test at the end. Students who pass the class are certified by AMSEC LLC as cable installation inspectors. Duration of the class is five days and is held at AMSEC LLC training facilities in Virginia Beach, Va.</p>
<p><br />(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).</p>
<p>The Type-B Certifications program inspects all electronics installations according to numerous NAVSEA installation requirements, with an emphasis on NAVSEAINST 9304.1C (Shipboard Electrical Cable and Cableway Inspection and Reporting Procedures) and DOD-STD-2003 NAVY EPISM (Electrical Plant Installation Standards Method). The NAVSEA Cableway course is a requirement for Type-B Certification Inspectors, and as such, is an important training tool for the fleet to meet required NAVY and DOD installation standards. Estimated value $7,500.00 for a 5-Day Training for up to 20 Students.</p>
<p><br />(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. <br />IAW FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>Since 1996, AMSEC LLC (formerly SAIC AMSEC) has been acknowledged by the U.S. Navy as the sole authorized NAVSEA instructor for training personnel for the installation and inspection of shipboard cables in accordance with NAVSEAINST 9304.1C (Shipboard Electrical Cable and Cableway Inspection and Reporting Procedures), and DOD-STD-2003 NAVY EPISM (Electrical Plant Installation Standards Method).</p>
<p><br />(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. <br />This requirement will be posted to Fed-Biz-Ops with the statement that any offerors that feel that they can meet the requirement may provide quotations/proposals. <br /><br />(7) A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. <br />The offered price is the same that the General Public would pay for this same 5-Day Training Session. This Training is available to the General Public as stated by the Contractor AMSEC.<br />(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. <br />A search using the World Wide Web was conducted, and that search confirmed that no other sources are known by the Government to conduct this specialized training. <br />(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: <br />(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. <br />(ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. <br />(iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government. <br />This special Training is certified thru the US Naval Sea Systems Command, it would not be feasible or practical for the Navy to certify another Contractor to conduct this specialized training. Ref NAVSEAINST 9304.1C and letter From: the Commander Naval Systems Command, To: Commander in Chief US Atlantic Fleet/Commander in Chief US Pacific Fleet.</p>
<p>(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.<br />None at this time.</p>
<p>(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. <br />None at this time.</p>
<p><br />(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. <br />(b) Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Legal effect of quotations: As prescribed in FAR 13.004(a) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Therefore issuance by the Government of an order in response to a suppliers quotation does not establish a contract.  The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions.  A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.  Facsimile quotes are acceptable and may be forwarded via fax number 252-334-5242.  Point of contact is Daniel House, Phone 252-384-7230, and email: Daniel.K.House@uscg.mil.

FAR 52.212-2 EvaluationCommercial Items (Jan 1999)
Request for Quotations (RFQ) will be evaluated against the requirements listed in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, and the ALC drawings.

Quotes may be submitted on company letterhead stationary and must include the following information: Solicitation Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, Unit Price, Extended Price, Payment Terms and discount offered for prompt payment. 

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government in technical factors, and price considered.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors are listed in order of importance.  When combined, non-price factors are more important than price. 

1)	Technical Conformance to Specifications
2)	Past Performance
3)	Warranty
4)	Price

Technical Conformance 

The technical evaluation will include examination of the product literature and technical features for conformance with the requirements of the drawings. Evaluation of products will be on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating obtaining any information not identified in the offer. An offer that does not provide sufficient information which describes their capacity to meet the RFQs technical evaluation criteria can result in failure of this evaluation factor. 

Past Performance

Offers shall provide at least two (2) references for recent and relevant contracts for the manufacturing of safety belts.  Reference information must include contract numbers, points of contract names with telephone numbers and other relevant information.  For this factor the Government will evaluate information obtained from past performance information that the Government obtains about the offeror from these contacts or other sources.  Failure to address this requirement can result in failure of this evaluation factor.

Warranty
 
Offerors are required to offer the Government at least the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public in customary commercial practice.

Price

Proposals should identify any price reductions offered, or quantity discounts.

(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

(c) A written notice of award of acceptance or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is an RFI only in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide Contract Logistics Support (CLS) and Training System Support Center (TSSC) services for the B-1B and complete required Sustainment Block upgrades. Potential sources must also be able to perform upgrades to the Cockpit displays to include the Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL), Central Integrated Test System (CITS), and Vertical Situational Display Upgrade (VSDU) and other miscellaneous updates following the end of the existing B-1B TS services contract in December 2011.The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the FAR. Companies responding to this sources sought are advised that participation does not ensure involvement in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The B-1B TS consists of an aircrew Simulator System (SS) component and Maintenance Training Equipment (MTE), which support initial, continuation, and re-qualification training of B-1B aircrews and maintainers. The SS consists of five Weapon Systems Trainers (WSTs), two Mission Trainers (MTs), and five Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs). The MTE consists of nine Simulated Maintenance Training Systems (SMTSs), eight Avionics/Armament Maintenance Training Systems (A/AMTSs), and a Primary/Secondary Flight Control Maintenance Trainer (P/SFCMT).

<CONTACT>Nathan Johnson, Email nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>Based upon current responses a future solicitation will be released as a small business set-aside. This announcement does not commit the Government to a solicitation or an award of a contract. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
<p>At this time (May 2010) the demand for GonaCon is not large enough to justify a manufacturing contract. USDA APHIS will continue to receive information from interested contractors for market research purposes. The conversion of this sources sought notice to a solicitation will be done under this notice (AG-6395-S-10-0042) or, if done under a new notice, a link to the solicitation number will be added to this sources sought notice. By adding this solicitation to your FBO.gov watch list you should get updates of any changes.</p>
<br /><br /><br />The United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services (WS) is seeking interested parties capable of manufacturing GonaCon Immunocontraceptive Vaccine. Manufacturing must be conducted under Good Laboratory Practices, Good Manufacturing Practices or similar ISO certifications. Manufacturing would be required at a minimum of twice per year.
<p>The GonaConTM Immunocontraceptive Vaccine formulation consists of a multi-step process where mammalian Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) is conjugated to a mollusk hemocyanin and emulsified in a mineral oil based adjuvant to form the final product (Figure 1). Prior to conjugation the hemocyanin carrier protein must be maleimide activated. Dialysis is performed to remove excess maleimide formed after the activation. GnRH is then conjugated to the maleimide activated hemocyanin. The aduvant is formulated separately from the rest of the vaccine by preparing a suspension of killed bacteria in light mineral oil. Final preparation of the vaccine involves vortex mixing the peptide/hemocyanin conjugate with the adjuvant preparation and producing the final emulsion by running the preparation through an emulsifier. The final emulsion is loaded into 3 ml polyethylene syringes. Individual syringes are then labeled, packaged and shipped to a predetermined USDA facility. All phases of manufacturing must be conducted under clean room conditions. Specialized equipment requirements include a spectrophotometer for quality assurance monitoring, and a emulsification instrument capable of producing 6000 psi (e.g., Microfluidics Model M110L or equivalent).<br /></p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from the U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, Natick, MA, to identify sources with the capability to rapidly develop and manufacture an expendable gliding decelerator system compatible with the Armys current Joint Precision Aerial Delivery System, 2,000 Pound (JPADS 2K).<BR><BR>The gliding decelerator system must be capable of being deployed at up to 18,000 ft MSL (threshold) and 25,000 ft MSL (objective) from USAF cargo aircraft, with a lift to drag ratio of 3.2 to 1 and sufficiently robust to safely deliver a 1000  1850 lb (threshold) and 500  2200 pound (objective) payload with a reliability of 92% with a 90% confidence and interface with the JPADS 2K Airborne Guidance Unit (AGU).<BR><BR>The current JPADS 2K gliding decelerator system is comprised of a 1025 sq ft. semi-elliptical parafoil that is deployed by a static line initiated drogue parachute.   <BR>The two basic problems with re-using parafoils in an operational environment are recovery and material damage. Since the systems are typically used in areas inaccessible by ground vehicles, the current Concept of Operations (CONOPs) calls for returning airdrop systems primarily via helicopter. Space on helicopters is at a premium due to the volume and weight of equipment and personnel that have to be transported. Since the JPADS 2K systems AGU is the more expensive and the smaller of the two components (wt and volume), the parafoil is often not recovered, or sustains significant damage from the cutting of suspension lines rendering it beyond economical repair. Second, if parafoils are not expeditiously recovered from the dropzone they can sustain damage from the extreme environmental conditions. Sunlight degrades the strength of the material and the wind can drag the parafoil through rough terrain that damages both the parafoil material and lines often beyond economical repair. An AGU can survive much longer in these environments and is therefore more readily re-used.  <BR>An expendable and hence lower cost parafoil for the JPADS 2K system would provide an airdrop capability beneficial to both the Air Force (high altitude delivery with horizontal offset) and the Army since the Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) would not need to recover and retrograde the parafoils back to riggers for re-use.  <BR><BR>It is recognized that with an expendable and less expensive parafoil the performance characteristics may diminish; however it is essential the parafoil still be capable of performing the mission requirements under the current JPADS 2K Concept of Operations (CONOPs). At a minimum, it should be capable of being deployed at altitudes of up to 18,000 ft MSL (Threshold) 24,500 ft AGL (Objective), of carrying between 1000  1850 lbs of suspended weight (T) 500  2200 lbs suspended (O), compatible with the JPADS 2K flight parameters found in the JPADS Mission Planner and landing at 28.5 fps (T) or less (O) with the cargo payload 85% mission capable (T) or greater (O). Deployment may be from fixed wing or rotary wing aircraft. It should deploy without damage and be capable of delivering the payload safely and in working condition. This parafoil is intended for use with cargo systems only and will not be used for personnel. The parafoil system should be delivered to the government pre-packed. A one time use parafoil that arrives pre-packed from the manufacturer will relieve receiving units in theater of the burden of parafoil packing in addition to recovery and repair. The parafoils should attach to an AGU and payload using established JPADS 2K rigging methods as much as possible and not require new training for riggers. It should also be compatible with the Armys existing JPADS 2K AGU configuration and Guidance, Navigation and Control software; having steering lines that can be controlled by the AGU and able to withstand the forces and wear/tear imposed by the AGUs motors. Interface specifications for the JPADS 2K parafoil and AGU are available from the technical point of contact below to responders who have or can demonstrate the ability to manufacture such systems/components. <BR><BR>The government is looking for the offerors to provide an estimate of the manufacturing costs and delivery schedule estimate of the proposed system in quantities of 10, 100 and 500 to include a delivery schedule for each quantity. Achievement of the cost and schedule goals can be attained by development or use of inexpensive textiles and innovative construction techniques that will produce a ram-air parachute capable of meeting the aforementioned performance requirements. Offerors need to be cognizant of the Berry Amendment, which precludes the Department of Defense from procuring textile or textile end products that are not produced or manufactured in the United States. Therefore, any parachute material or end product must be made in the United States. <BR><BR>Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside of the U.S. government. All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for information solicited. We are seeking sources, technical and product information for products which meet the DoD requirements, or may meet requirements with modifications. Firms responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter. Please submit your responses by 7 June 2010.

<DESC>THE SOLICITATION HAS BEEN UPLOADED TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT 4/27/2010.  THIS IS NOT A DRAFT.

Solicitation Number:

10-223-SOL-00082  Presolicitation

Notice Type:

Presolicitation

Synopsis:

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals under solicitation number 10-223-SOL-00082 (subject to change) for a program called the FDA Data Management Program (DMP).  The NAICS Code is 518210 with a small business size standard of $25 million.  

Project Background:

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of all FDA regulated products such as human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, food and dietary supplements, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. For each respective Center within FDA, legislation is set forth for voluntary and mandatory reporting of adverse events, product problems or complaints, and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) as cited in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act and other laws affecting the FDA. FDA receives these reports by electronic submission, mail, phone, fax, email, and via the internet. FDA requires support services for data entry and processing received reports. The key source of data entry includes Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs).1 These ICSRs are submitted to each Center in various formats. Currently, each Center has individual programs in place for supporting these legislative mandates and their respective missions. This contract shall provide the opportunity and means to align the individual Center programs with the Agency goal of a Unified Adverse Event Data Management Program, hereafter referred to as the Data Management Program (DMP). 

The FDA Centers missions and legislative authorization are presented below for FDA regulated products:

The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the FDA Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research (CBER) perform a crucial part of FDA's mission, pre-market and post-market safety and efficacy assessments of human drugs and biological products. The collection and analysis of reports by FDA staff must occur throughout the entire life cycle of the product in order to identify occurrences associated with the use of a drug or biologic in humans that could not have been predicted by such methods as clinical trials and bio-statistical analysis. These occurrences of adverse events or product problems must be reported to FDA in order for the Agency to carry out its mission protecting the U.S. public health.  CDER and CBER receive reports submitted by stakeholders such as manufacturers, importers, health care professionals, and consumers. In addition, FDA employees may obtain follow-up information and submit reports from the FDA field offices. 

For CDER and CBER the statutory provisions for FDAs requirement to record mandatory submission of adverse drug reports for an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or New Drug Application (NDA), Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA,) Biologic Licensing Application (BLA)and OTC products in an adverse event reporting system is Section 505(k))(1)2 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 CFR 310.305, 312.32, 314.80 and 600.80, Public Health Service Act, and Public law 109-462 

Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), is a standardized international terminology for coding of medical information for regulatory communication. MedDRA was developed by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH); it is used in electronic transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) following the ICH E2B standards. MedDRA enables medical accuracy and transparency in coding, and standardized communication of coded data between manufacturers/sponsors and regulators.

The FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) develops and implements national programs to protect the public health in the fields of medical devices and radiological health. These programs are intended to assure the safety, effectiveness, and proper labeling of medical devices. CDRH has the responsibility for post-market surveillance such as monitoring the performance, safety, and effectiveness of marketed medical devices. The objective of post-market surveillance is to protect the public from actual or potential hazards associated with medical devices.  CDRH receives device event reports submitted by stakeholders such as medical device manufacturers, importers, user facilities, health care professionals and consumers.

Section 519 of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act authorized CDRH to record mandatory submission of reports to protect the public from actual or potential hazards associated with medical devices. The MDR Regulation (21 CFR Part 803) establishes the requirements for the mandatory reporting of adverse events involving medical devices. The Medical Device Amendments to the FD&C were enacted on May 28, 1976.  The FD&C Act was amended again in 1997 by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA), which provide for streamlining the process of bringing safe and effective medical devices to the U.S. Market.

Enactment of the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 (SMDA) and the 1992 Medical Device Amendment made a significant impact upon the mandatory aspects of CDRHs  post-market surveillance program.  In accordance with the MDR regulation 21 CFR Part 803.32 and 803.40, these revisions created an obligation for user facilities to report deaths and importers to report deaths and serious injuries directly to FDA and to the manufacturer.

The mission of the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) is to protect the public health by ensuring that the nations food supply is safe, sanitary, wholesome, and properly labeled, and that cosmetic products are safe and properly labeled.  CFSAN-regulated products include dairy products, plant foods, beverages, seafood, dietary supplements, cosmetic products, infant formula, medical foods, and color additives to food.  The CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS) is a post marketing surveillance system to collect, analyze, monitor, and report adverse events and product complaints for CFSAN regulated products. Both mandatory and voluntary reporting of adverse events and product complaints are processed through CAERS.  In addition, specific legislation may require Centers to maintain stand-alone tracking systems such as infant formula and bioterrorism.  Mandatory reporting for dietary supplements is authorized under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&C) Act Section 761 and mandatory reporting for reportable food is authorized under FFD&C Section 417.  

The Reportable Food Registry (RFR or the Registry) is an electronic portal for Industry to report when there is reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences. The RFR applies to all FDA-regulated categories of food and feed, except dietary supplements and infant formula (Section 417 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 350f)).  Registered Food Facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold food for human or animal consumption in the United States under section 415(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 350d) are required to report to FDA when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.  Federal, state, and local Government officials may also use the RFR portal to report information that may come to them about reportable foods.  
The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) regulates the manufacture and distribution of food additives and drugs that will be given to animals. These include animals from which human foods are derived, as well as food additives and drugs for pet (or companion) animals. CVM is responsible for regulating drugs, devices, and food additives given to, or used on, over one hundred million companion animals, plus millions of poultry, cattle, swine, and minor animal species. 
Post-marketing surveillance affords the primary means by which CVM obtains information regarding potential problems with the safety and efficacy of marketed approved new animal drugs as well as potential product and manufacturing problems. CVM receives reports submitted by stakeholders such as: manufacturers, importers, health care professionals, and consumers. This contract, at the present time, will only address post-marketing safety reporting. The scope may broaden to include premarketing in the future.

Section 512(l) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(l), and  514.80(b) of FDA regulations (21 CFR 514.80) requires applicants of approved animal drugs  to report adverse drug experiences and product and manufacturing defects.  Product and manufacturing defects must be reported if they meet the criteria in 21 CFR 514.80(b)(1).  Adverse drug events and product and manufacturing defects involving animals must be submitted based on the criteria in 21 CFR 514.80 (b)(2)(i) and (ii), and (4)(iv).  Voluntary reports are also accepted from consumers and veterinarians.

The Tobacco Control Act enacted by Congress and signed by the President in June 2009 created the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP).  As the mission of this Center is developed, reporting regulations will be defined and may require collection of adverse event reports related to products that the Center regulates.  This Center will be eligible to have a task order under this Agency-wide contract.

Over time, FDA intends to replace multiple current legacy processes and data systems that are used for the receipt, processing, validation, and assessment of received reports.  These transitions may require the adoption of new software, revised SOPs, and additional staff training under this contract.  Additionally, FDA intends to adopt emerging data exchange standards which may impact future electronic submission procedures.  FDA is in the early stages of transitioning to a single electronic internet portal for adverse event and product problem reporting for all products.  This portal will be known as the Safety Reporting Portal.  The Safety Reporting Portal will allow reports to be typed into a "rational questionnaire" internet application that tailors questions based on the type of report, product, event, etc.  As FDA transitions to new technologies, it is expected that tasks under this contract will be impacted.  These impacts will need to be assessed as they occur and modifications to task orders under this contract may need to be considered. 

Objectives:

The objectives of the Data Management Program (DMP) are to obtain the services of a single Contractor to provide qualified support for: 
1.	Processing reports commonly known as Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) such as triaging, registering (logging), tracking, imaging or scanning, data entry, data entry quality control, updating of data records (to include resolving duplicates and conflicting information), reviewing, editing, coding, coding quality control (QC), coding quality assurance (QA), filing and redacting, distributing, archiving, and shredding of physical media.

This Market Research and Sources Sought announcement is issued to determine industry interest, capabilities and qualifications to manufacture, store, transport and deliver representational glass and crystal tabletop ware to the Department of State.  The information obtained from this announcement shall be used for preliminary acquisition planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind to award a contract.

The United States international relations, national interest and success are, in part, built upon the ability of our ambassadors to entertain host country nationals in our embassies and residences abroad.  In this regard, furniture, art and tableware that are provided by the Department of State to our embassies and residencies abroad represent U.S. cultural and manufacturing excellence to our host country guests.

Government will retain 100 % ownership of the all designs, dyes, casts, prototypes, etc. for the glass and crystal tabletop ware items as stated in the awarded contract.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY

This is a Sources Sought Notice and does not constitute a commitment by the Government.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10, to identify potential sources to provide the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market.  All information submitted in response to this sources sought notice is voluntary and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.  Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately.  All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is pursuing multiple and parallel strategies to close the gap between current antiviral drug supply and the HHS goal of stockpiling approved agents and developing new antiviral agents as part of the strategic plan for pandemic preparedness.  HHS is particularly interested in the advanced development of new influenza antiviral agents or drug candidates effective against influenza designed to target novel mechanisms of action or to enhance effects of present classes of influenza antiviral drugs, formulated for long term stability, long bioavailability, and simple dosing regimens.  Ultimately, these influenza antiviral agents shall be produced at one or more Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed domestic manufacturing facilities and shall provide sufficient surge capacity to contribute substantially to U.S. and ideally global antiviral needs during an influenza pandemic. 

Respondents must meet the following mandatory qualification criteria:

1.	Demonstration of Advanced Development/U.S. Influenza Antiviral Agent Licensure/Approval 

It is essential that efforts funded subsequently shall lead to U.S. licensure/approval of an influenza antiviral agent that can be used to protect the U.S. population in the event of an influenza pandemic.  The Respondent must demonstrate significant progress towards development of an antiviral drug or biologic (not vaccines) by documenting the submission of an IND and completion of a final report, reviewed by the Respondent, of Phase I clinical trials for safety by the time of contract proposal submission.

The small business size standard for this NAICS code is 500 employees.  Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy, including whether or not a set-aside is possible.

<p><em>The following questions are intended to help the Census Bureau learn more about best practices for the acquisition of commercial databases to improve coverage of administrative records data used in the work described above. Although answers to these questions are optional, the Census Bureau encourages companies to submit responses based on their knowledge and experience with this service in the commercial marketplace. Based on the information provided, and as part of its ongoing market research, the Census Bureau may contact individual respondents for additional information.</em></p>
<p><em>All information provided will be kept confidential and will be utilized for market research purposes directly related to the work described above.<br /></em><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INSTRUCTIONS:</span></strong></p>
<p>Responses to this RFI should be sent as an attachment to randy.w.hart@census.gov, in Word or PDF format document, not to exceed <strong>twelve (12)</strong> pages (8.5" x 11", 12-pitch font size).</p>

<p>1. Company name, address, and Web site.<br /><br />2. Contact person's name, position, email and phone number.<br /><br />3. Brief description of the organization, including business size (e.g. large business, small business (including type) and services provided. If company has a current GSA contract, please provide the contract number.<br /><br />4. Available Databases (Db). For each, include: <br /><br />a. Db name,<br />b. Db coverage - uniform nationwide, non-uniform nationwide (please elaborate where coverage is &lt; 95%), Puerto Rico, etc.,<br />c. Data dictionary of all variables/elements to include the data source(s) and update frequency (daily, monthly, quarterly, etc.) for each variable/element***, and<br />d.

<p>You may include marketing literature or brochures (pdf format) with your response. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">QUESTIONS:</span></strong></p>
<p>1. The Census Bureau is investigating the acquisition of person-level microdata (not a query-based service). Does your company have experience(s) selling ready-available databases to government agencies? If the answer is yes, please provide:</p>
<p>a. A brief description of previous experiences;<br />b. Name of the agency(ies) and a point of contact; and<br />c. Any lessons learned that could assist the US Census Bureau in procuring commercial databases.</p>
<p>2. Does your company have a standard non-disclosure agreement for the use of the data supplied? If the answer is yes, please provide a copy.</p>
<p>3. Does your company have a standard license agreement for the data usage? If the answer is yes, please provide a copy.</p>
<p>4. The Census Bureau needs to assess household information as of Census Day, April 1, 2010. Data that have been overwritten with address updates after April 1, 2010 will not suffice. Does your company maintain a cumulative person-address file that can be extracted for particular dates?</p>
<p>5. Is there any minimum requirement to engage your services? Does your company require clients to buy at least three months of data / two databases /five data fields, etc.? Would your company resell persons' data in entirety, providing names and addresses for all persons nationwide?</p>
<p>6. The Census Bureau may require indefinite retention of all raw files purchased, and all derivative files created, without any requirements or fees for re-licensing. Would your company meet this requirement? Please define and identify any implications to this approach.</p>
<p>7. What is the primary purpose of person and household level databases sold by your company (i.e., marketing, risk assessment)? How are data gathered? What are the major sources of data your company provides? How does your company evaluate these sources to ensure the accuracy of the data provided?</p>
<p>8. What commercial/industry standards does your company employ for mitigating, managing and preventing data breaches or data being stolen?</p>
<p>9. Describe your company's pricing policy. Please provide as much detail as possible, including, to the maximum extent possible, the estimated cost of the database(s) on a monthly, quarterly, and/or yearly basis, as applicable. Does your company have differential pricing based on the amount of content being purchased?</p>
<p>10. Should the Census Bureau pursue a RFP, interested parties would be expected to submit test files for specified geographical areas. Please describe any conditions your company would have for submission of test files, if any.</p>
<p>11. Please provide any additional information your company considers to be useful to the Census Bureau during the market research process, including industry-preferred strategies for the acquisition of commercial databases.</p>
<p><strong>12.&nbsp; The Census Bureau is assessing the impact the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999&nbsp;(GLBA) has on the acquisition of data.&nbsp; Please describe how GLBA would impact your company's response to any potential RFP's for commercial data.&nbsp; Do you consider any data potentially exchanged with the Census Bureau to be covered by GLBA?&nbsp;&nbsp;Does your company have&nbsp;different applications of the Act, dependent on how the data are used?&nbsp; How are other Government agencies dealing with GLBA, if known?</strong></p>

<DESC>Department of Veterans AffairsCAI-FrederickSynopsis for Acquisition Workforce TrainingThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has authority under the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (Pub. L. no. 109-461, 120 Stat. 3433 (2006)) and Executive Order 13360 to establish special acquisition methods to increase contracting and subcontracting opportunities for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) and veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs).  In an effort to support this Act, the VA is pursuing a total set-aside solicitation for SDVOSBs and VOSBs for Acquisition Workforce Training.This solicitation is being synopsis accordance with FAR 5.201.  1.	Action Code:  P - Presolicitation Notice2.	Date:  February 25, 20103.	Year:  20104.	Contracting Office Zip Code:  217035.	Classification Code:  U008  Trng/Curriculum Dvlp6.	Contracting Office Address:Department of Veterans AffairsCAI-Frederick7485 New Horizon WayFrederick, MD  217037.	Subject:  Acquisition Workforce Training8.	Proposed Solicitation Number:  VA798-10-RP-00609.	Closing Response Date:  April 12, 201010.	Primary POC:  Lora GrossAlternate POC:  James Poe11.	Description:In April 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) published Policy Letter 05-01, Developing and Managing the Acquisition Workforce, which requires the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to develop, and the Chief Acquisition Officers Council (CAOC) to approve, a certification program for contracting professionals in civilian agencies that reflects common standards.  The goal of the certification program is to standardize the education, training, and experience requirements for contracting professionals, which will improve workforce competencies and increase career opportunities.The program mirrors, as closely as possible, the requirements that the Department of Defense established for its contracting workforce under the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act.  The program will be administered by each civilian agency, and FAI will conduct periodic reviews to ensure that the program is being managed consistently.  The certification shall be accepted by, at minimum, all civilian agencies as evidence that an employee meets the core education, training and experience requirements to be a contracting professional (generally the GS-1102 series).The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and the subsequently Office of  Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 05-01 (found at www.fai.gov ) require the heads of Federal agencies, through their Senior Procurement Executive, to define the education, training and experience necessary for career progression within the acquisition workforce job functions including mandatory coursework and on-the-job training.  Under the current law, individuals in the occupational series GS-1102 and those possessing a contracting officer's warrant regardless of their occupational series are required to meet certain baseline training and education requirements based on their grade.  In addition to the 1102 series, VA has expanded the definition of "acquisition workforce" to include Contracting Officer Technical Representatives (COTRs).  The VAAA's mission is to develop competency-based training programs for the VA's acquisition workforce to ensure acquisition excellence within the agency.  For the past two years, the VA has been coordinating classes for the acquisition workforce.  Based on lessons learned, they are seeking contractors to provide FAI approved or DAU certified acquisition training courses and materials for FAC-C Certification, Contracting Electives and COTR, to better establish consistency, and create a more efficient process for procurement.  A Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract will be awarded in accordance with FAR 12 and 15 for Commercial and Negotiated acquisition procedures.The anticipated period of performance is for a term of five (5) years.10.  Place of Contract Performance:  Performance will be predominantly at the VA Acquisition Academy (VAAA) in Frederick, MD.  There will be no reimbursement for local travel within the Washington, DC metro area.11.  Set Aside:  This acquisition will be negotiated on a total SDVOSB/VOSB small business set-aside basis.12.  Transmittal:    All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by VA.  This solicitation and any subsequent amendments will be posted to the FBO website:  https://www.fbo.gov/.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be posted to the FBO website on or about March 12, 2010 with proposals due by April 12, 2010.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals prior to offer due date.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION: This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars and is awarded under Contract No. HHSN261200800001E with SAIC-Frederick, Inc., the Operations and Technical Support contract for NCI-Frederick. The Contractor's DUNS number is 159990456.
<p>The purpose of this action is to fund the following ARRA project:</p>
<p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a large-scale, collaborative effort to characterize the genomic changes that occur in cancer.</p>
<p>Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Award: This award is priced as an "Other Than Fixed Price" action. Work assigned to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. is pursuant to the terms and conditions of Contract No. HHSN261200800001E, a cost-plus-award-fee prime contract for operations and technical support to the NCI-Frederick. The use of a separate fixed price award to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. is not appropriate because this is Research and Development work issued under an existing cost reimbursement contract.</p>
<p>Justification for Noncompetitive Award: This ARRA funded award is being made as a within scope modification to an existing contract awarded noncompetitively to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. pursuant to a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition signed by the DHHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Management and Policy on January 17, 2007</p>

The works includes development of these models requires capability in fluid dynamics, hydraulics, hydrology, river geomorphology, and computer engineering.  This work will expand and extend recent hydrodynamic modeling work conducted by the University of Iowa Institute for Hydraulic R  esearch (IIHR) utilizing MIKE 21 and FLUENT models.  This project will use newly acquired floodplain elevation and bathymetry data, collected by the Corps Environmental Management Program (EMP), the recently developed seamless digital elevation data layer for Pool 8 developed by USGS-UMESC, and will expand the range of conditions and landscape elements included in previous models.  The model will dynamically simulate movement of water over the landscape (including beyond bank full), based on a sequence of daily discharges and rules for dam operations, and predict the distribution, abundance, and dynamics of habitat features through time.  This modeling framework will be built on standard physical data (land elevation, land cover, daily discharge) such that similar models can be developed at any location within the system where those data are available.

Cost contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  The nature of development work often requires a cost arrangement.  In addition, appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and cost controls are used.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 31 MAR 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 31 MAR 2010. Contact Sheila Midgette at 252-335-6493 or Sheila.G.Midgette@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation. Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5240, or at the following address: <br /><br />USCG Aviation Logistics Center<br />Short Range Recovery Division, Bldg 75<br />Attn: Sheila Midgette<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909</p>

<AWDNBR>DCA200-00-C-5000
<MODNBR>P00035
<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) at Scott Air Force Base, IL intends to issue a sole source modification to Americom Government Services, Inc (AGS), 1101 Opal Court, Hagerstown, MD 21740-5947. The proposed modification is a continuation and extension of the work performed by AGS under contract DCA200-00-C-5000, which was competitively awarded on 31 October 1999.
<p>This modification will extend the period of performance of the contract for the existing telecommunication service for Thule Greenland by one three month base period plus three one month option periods for the period of 01 May 2010 through 31 October 2010. This service consists of the leased service for five (5) continuous, uninterrupted, full duplex, dedicated T1 (1.544Mb) telecommunications circuits between Schriever Air Force Base (SSAFB) and Thule Tracking Station (TTS), Thule Greenland. <br />Service includes full end-to-end (i.e., service demarcation point to service demarcation point) responsibility for the provision, engineering, furnishing, installation, test, performance, and maintenance of facilities and equipment necessary to provide the following symmetrical digital transmission service between TTS and SSAFB.</p>
<p>This service directly supports critical Command, Control, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) Communication mission requirements between SSAFB and TTS and the Government cannot take the risk of loss of service. AGS is currently the only commercial provider of high band-width and/or satellite service into Thule, Greenland. AGS is the only commercial communications company that already has in place all the equipment, facilities, and infrastructure needed to provide, operate and maintain the requested service. They have an operational Satellite Station with 11 meter antennas and currently provide service that supports the required service.<br />Due to adverse weather conditions at Thule a lengthy construction cycle of at least two years is needed to allow completion of any construction by other vendors. The construction season for exterior work at Thule is from 15 Jul to 15 September only. The number of daylight hours per day fluctuates depending on the time of the year and can range from 0-24. Approval of this modification will allow for the lead-time needed for installation of the service by a new vendor.</p>
<p>This leased telecommunication service provided by AGS between Thule, Greenland and Schriever AFB, CO, directly supports DISA's ability to provide real time command and control communications to the War Fighters.</p>
<p>The above contract action will be awarded sole source to AGS, based on their unique ability and capability to maintain the current telecommunication service.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>All inquiries regarding the sole source modification shall be submitted electronically and directed to Deborah A. Benscoter, Contracting Officer, Phone 618-229-9298, email deborah.benscoter@disa.mil, or Cheryl Wilsing, Contract Specialist, Phone 618-229-9145, email cheryl.wilsing@disa.mil. (NAICS) 517410 is applicable to this acquisition.</p>
