<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to awards a service contract for the collection of Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) data and for providing Federal Employees and retirees access to accreditation information.

HEDIS is a tool used to measure and assess health plans' performances by looking at their structures and processes.  HEDIS is also part of an integrated system, to establish accountability in managed care.  

OPM intends to awards a service contract to the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), 2000 L Street, NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC  20036, for the collection of HEDIS data.  HEDIS was developed and maintained by NCQA, an organization committed to assessing, reporting on and improving the quality of care provided by organized delivery systems.  NCQA has developed the measures OPM wishes to collect and are already receiving the data in an established database from many of the health plans OPM wants to participate.  OPM wants this project to be integrative, as much as possible, with NCQA's current data collection activities and information products.  This approach would take maximum advantage of NCQA's existing systems and processes, resulting in substantial savings to the Government, since NCQA will not charge the Government for work they are already performing.  Any other contractor would have to duplicate the effort and charge accordingly.

Any company which believes they can provide an equivalent services should provide complete information regarding their service and representative pricing to OPM within 15 days of the publication of this notice.  This is not a soliciation for offers but rather a notice of OPM's intent to negotiate a sole source award to NCQA.  If OPM determines that competition is possible, a pre-solicitation notice will be issued.

This course represents an important first step for anyone who wishes to become proficient with an object-oriented programming language in general and the Java language in particular.  The goals of this course are to:  
  - Make students comfortable with fundamental object-oriented (OO) terminology and concepts.
  - To serve as the proper grounding for learning an object-oriented programming language (OOPL) such as Java.
  - Provide an introduction to core Java language syntax.
  - Enable students to read and understand simple Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams.
  - Illustrate the basics of how such a UML class diagram is translated into a working software application ? a Java application, to be specific.

  --  Deploying Java Objects:  
This course, intended as a sequel to the Beginning Java Objects course, builds upon the concepts taught in the Beginning Java Objects to illustrate how a command line driven application (such as the banking application built by students through lab exercise in the first course) can be rounded out into an ?industrial strength? application employing a graphical user interface (GUI) front end and a means of persisting data.  Upon completion of this course the participant will be able to accomplish the following:  
  - With respect to data persistence, students will learn how to store and retrieve data from text files, and are introduced conceptually to the use of the JDBC API for accessing relational databases.
  - With respect to GUI technology, the course teaches students how to develop:  a stand-alone Java application using the Swing API and a Web deployed application consisting of a Java servlet back-end generating an HTML front end.
  - Students are also introduced conceptually to the use of applets, Java Server Pages (JSPs), and Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) in deploying web based, Java enabled application.

The vendor will develop and deliver training services for the BLS as follows:  
  --  Developing and providing classroom training and seminars in courses in the BLS IT training curricula, emerging technologies, software management, and other important IT-related topics; 
  --  Developing and delivering superior course content; 
  --  Providing a BLS on-site library of current course materials; descriptions, outlines and prerequisites; 
  --  Ensuring that course materials reflect current BLS standards.  

The vendor will provide all services associated with delivering quality training for system developers, analysts, computer specialists, end-users, managers, and project leaders who require a comprehensive understanding of the subject material.

<DESC>The FY 2002 Congressional Conference Report on the budget, Report 107-308 directed funds .for the General Aviation Propulsion-Compression Ignition Test and Evaluation Program (GAP-CITEP), a joint FAA-NASA effort to evaluate alternative fuels to facilitate the transition away from leaded fuels for general aviation aircraft.  Teledyne Continental Motors, Inc.(TCMI), of Mobile, Alabama had previously participated in the General Aviation Propulsion (GAP) program under the auspices of a NASA Cooperative Agreement, NCC3-515, that produced a prototype compression ignition (diesel) engine with potential application in general aviation. Some areas of the research on that prototype engine remain to be accomplished. Since TCMI is the manufacturer and owner of the prototype engine referenced by Congress, and the NASA Cooperative Agreement has expired, the Federal Aviation Administration now intends to enter into a single source procurement with TCMI, relative to continuing feas! ibility research to determine the cold starting characteristics and alternative fuel performance of the TCMIs general aviation compression ignition engine.  It is estimated that the period of performance for this effort will take 18 months from award of contract, with award anticipated by the end of September 2002. <P>

This course will be offered to FHWA employees and to State DOT's around the country.  The Federal-Aid 101 course is highly specialized, complex, arcane, and is not widely understood outside of the FHWA.

He has a unique understanding of the FHWA culture, work styles and the processes and challenges of the Federal-Aid Program in FHWA Division Offices.  Because of Mr. Nemmers numerous roles in FHWA, he has gained extensive knowledge of all facets of the Federal-Aid Highway Program and has played a significant role in redefining how the FHWA would manage its Federal-Aid Program.  He is also a certified NHI instructor and has successful previous experience teaching for the FHWA/NHI.  Mr. Nemmers brings a level of expertise to this course that has contributed to the overall value of the course content and its successful delivery.  Mr. Nemmers is the only known source available that possess a unique combination of specialized knowledge in the Federal-Aid Program, experience with FHWA, and extensive training background.  All of these unique qualifications are vitally important in satisfying FHWA?s requirements and ensuring the successful delivery of these Federal-Aid 101 courses.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to negotiate a sole source purchase order with The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy to arrange a Training Academy for Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs).  The primary purpose of the Academy will be to train elected officials who sit on Metropolitan Planning Organization Boards.  There are more than 340 MPOs with memberships reaching 30, 40, and sometimes 50 members.  The Training Academy will be primarily for elected officials, with some supplemental activities for MPO directors.  The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy has extensive history with working with senior-level policy makers, from state tax judges, to state transportation planning directors, to the planning directors of the largest US cities, and vice-presidents of urban universities responsible for real estate development.  The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy is uniquely qualified to provide the requested services because it has more than 55 years of history in interacting with and educating local elected officials about transportation and land use issues.  They have performed this work on national and international levels.  Their breadth of knowledge will enable them to bring in case studies and examples from numerous sources.  Their staff also has a proven track record in developing and instructing courses on land use and transportation.  As such, they will require no learning curve to coordinate and arrange these workshops and develop the case studies.  Because Lincoln Institute of Land Policy possess an intimate knowledge of the subject matter, has extensive history in interacting with and educating local elected officials about transportation and land use issues and have performed this work on national and international levels, they are the only known source for this effort.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the threshold is $100,000.  The anticipated award date is September 20, 2002.

<CONTACT>Criss Cullison, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-9057, Fax 301-757-2628, Email cullisoncm@navair.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price contract to purchase Commercial Off The Shelf critical chain multi-project management software, along with installation, training, implementation, and maintenance support.  The primary project categories are aircraft, engines and components. Projects are created to provide for the repair and overhaul of Department of Defense aircraft and the return of these aircraft to the Depots' customers.  Projects consist of and are developed around discrete and well-defined groups of work, and range in duration from a few weeks to just less than a year. The overall goal is to reduce cycle time for major programs at the depot by implementing Theory of Constraints (TOC) methodology.  To do this, a critical chain multi-project management solution to meet management needs in the following areas is required: Project, Resource and Task Scheduling: Set feasible schedules, accounting for material and capacity constraints; hold schedules stable despite the high variability of maintenance, repair and overhaul work; set unambiguous and uniform priorities across projects and resources in real time; Management Control over Schedule Execution and Performance: Make efficient use of capacity and time buffers in execution; establish an effective and efficient process of ongoing improvement; and Optimization: Do what-ifs to optimize project cycle times, capacity utilization and product mix.  The solution must operate successfully within the constraints of the depot operating environment.  At a minimum, NAVAIR intends to purchase one enterprise site license (unlimited use) for its depot at Cherry Point, NC, with the option to purchase up to two additional licenses for its depots at Jacksonville, FL, and North Island, CA, supporting both internal and external users.  This term of the contract is one base year plus four options.  On-site support is required at the Naval Air Depot, Naval Air Station, Cherry Point, NC, with options for the Naval Air Depots at Jacksonville, FL, and North Island, CA. The price of the enterprise license shall include commercial software documentation, installation, and a 12-month warranty.  The Government, as owner of the license, will designate authorized users of the software at the sites and may include Government or Government Contractor Support personnel.  The software shall meet the following Scheduling requirements: Translate buffer status into "effective buffer consumption" for each task, i.e., how much is the net impact of each task on project and milestone buffers; capability to schedule single and multiple projects using critical chain methodology; automatic diagnosis of errors in project networks related to project network construction and resource assignment; establish a project baseline for one aircraft and many in-process aircraft at the same time with capability to re-baseline; critical chain automated buffering that allows the longest chain of dependent activities in a project to be buffered against statistical fluctuations; incorporate material and other supply constraints in critical chain calculations; link events in multiple projects, with automatic synchronization of schedules across projects; model multi-skilled workforce through organization of capacity data in "logical skills" hierarchy, with no limit on the number of levels in hierarchy; constraints-based pipelining that allows multiple projects to be capacity tested, and staggered through the pipeline; constraints based pipelining finds the best possible project due date based on user specified constraining resources and project priorities; provision for variable capacity in constraints-based pipelining, with number of units and calendars varying over time; specify and account for protective capacity for resources in constraints-based pipelining over course of planning horizon; concurrent scheduling of multiple resource constraints (drums) in constraints-based pipelining; automatically calculates and identifies resource contention within a project when calculating buffer consumption; ability to determine tasks that are consuming buffer using bi-directional pegging of buffers (project, feeding, milestone and project-to-project) and tasks?all buffers that are affected by a task, and all tasks that can consume a given buffer; task priorities are set for each resource based on "effective buffer consumption" to ensure global coordination of schedules; when networks are modified to account for additions and/or changes in repair requirements recalculations of critical chain and re-placement of buffers are not required; calculate buffer consumption accurately even if tasks are executed out of sequence; globally set of buffer management flags based on depot business policies; and ability to efficiently handle a minimum of 500 individual unique projects with a minimum of 300 tasks per project across multiple product lines.  The software shall meet the following Management Control requirements:  Project Managers can monitor buffer consumption for their projects; present to Project Managers not only the tasks eating into the buffers, but also a list of downstream tasks with multiple sorting options so that they can analyze buffer consumption and create buffer recovery plans; project Managers can capture and monitor recovery actions in the system, and also track delta in buffer consumption between buffer recovery meetings to improve the effectiveness of buffer recovery plans; Resource Managers can identify emerging bottlenecks before they occur; present to Resource Managers a chart for tasks in their department, clearly highlighting when workload will exceed available capacity; Resource Managers can assign named (people, equipment and resources) with required capabilities from the chart schedule; Task Leads get a prioritized list of current as well as upcoming tasks, along with their "effective buffer consumption"; Task Leads get advance warning about supply constraints and their impact on project and milestone buffers; historical analysis of buffer consumption by resources, by task manager and by projects; output data from the software shall be exportable to and compatible with Microsoft Project 2000. The software shall meet the following Optimization requirements:  Pipeline drill-downs and what-ifs for setting project priorities and sequence based on customer due dates and constraint schedules; project drill-downs and what-ifs for trade-off among scope, resources and cycle time; project planning tools to analyze slack and buffers, and refine/redistribute buffers without causing critical chain to be recomputed; provide resource drill-downs that support the development of what if scenarios and assist in making decisions about hiring, cross-training, adding and reducing capacity, and pooling of resources among product lines.  The software shall meet the following Automation requirements:  Information can be submitted and processed in real time; reports are live (and not static reports that have to be manually published); Project Managers can submit projects to, and check out projects from, the central database over the web without an intermediary; Task Leads can update remaining duration and task status directly into the central database over the web; Task Leads have facility to maintain local checklists over the web without having to interact with project networks; buffer management runs can be set to execute automatically at pre-specified intervals, without locking up the entire database; buffer management results are automatically compiled into management reports across all projects; buffer management reports are available live over the web using an open systems architecture; user privileges can be set centrally, for individuals as well as a class of users, to provide different levels of access to different roles.  The software shall meet the following Technical requirements:  Utilization of Open Systems Architecture; ability to store information on projects, tasks and resources in a single database; utilization of industry standard open web server architecture such as ORACLE, APACHE and/or SQL database servers in an n-tiered environment; e.g., web, application and database servers; ability to access the application via the web through secure socket layer (https); compatibility with MS Internet Explorer 5.5 w/SP1 or higher; ability to fully support LDAP or NT Authentication; ability to support existing server Operating System Windows NT 4.0 or higher,  and existing client Operating System Windows 2000 or the Web; ability to operate within a secure environment from both within and outside firewall applications.  The Contractor shall provide functional and technical on-site support throughout the training and implementation phases.  Contractor support shall take place at the Government site.  While on a Government site, contractor personnel shall observe the same holiday schedule and shall work the same hours as the Government personnel.  The Contractor shall train the NAVAIR Depot enterprise on the installation, configuration, operation and support of the provided TOC software tool.  The training shall occur immediately prior to implementation at each site.  The Contractor shall provide a training plan, outlining their recommended approach.  The training plan will be approved by the Government prior to execution of training.  The Contractor shall provide enough training material for each student. Training will be conducted at a Government provided location (TBD) at or near the Government site.  Class size will vary depending on the training course.  Maximum class size for any given session requiring access to the application is 12 to 15.

Main Base Wastewater System: The wastewater collection system consists of 6,715 feet of gravity sewer piping, 3 lift stations, 14,205 feet of force main, 40 manholes, a 450,000-gallon attenuation tank, and 20 industrial service connections. All wastewater generated, with the exception of the Naval Reserve Complex, is pumped through a 12-inch force main to the City of Everett's wastewater system. All the wastewater transferred from the 16 wastewater ship connections on the pier flows to one of the onshore lift stations.  7. NAVSTA Everett - MWR (Smokey Point) Water Distribution System: The water distribution system supplies water from three connection points. The water distribution system at consists of two sections: the potable water section and the interior fire sprinkler section. The potable water section is a looped system consisting of approximately 7,800 feet of distribution lines and 1,600 feet of service lines to nine service connections. The potable water section provides exterior fire protection by means of fire hydrants located throughout the complex. The system also provides the water source to the interior fire sprinkler section for seven buildings via a pump house, a 100 HP 1,500 gpm fire pump, a small 2 HP 15 gpm jockey pump, and an emergency generator.  8. NAVSTA Everett - Main Base Water Distribution System: The water distribution system supplies water from two metered connections with reduced pressure backflow preventers. The water distribution system consists of approximately 5 miles of piping, fire hydrants, and isolation valves. There is no potable water pumping station or water storage facility. A 16-inch line extends from each of the service connections towards the piers and provides the backbone for the water distribution system. There are approximately 20 industrial connections and 20 pier service connections.  9. NAVSTA Everett - Main Base Steam Generation and Distribution System: The steam generation and distribution system provides steam to ships while they are in port, and also to the Laundromat on the pier. The steam distribution system consists of approximately 7,630 linear feet (LF) of steam distribution piping and 4,250 LF of condensate recovery piping, valves, traps, and expansion loops and joints. The steam plant, Building 2300, has 14,000 square feet of space including a 1,296 square foot mezzanine that houses the control room. All boilers are controlled by   a Bailey Infi 90 package of PLCs interfacing with the displays on the computers in both the local boiler front computer station and the remote second floor control room location. The steam plant houses five Cleaver Brooks boilers: one 30,000 lb, three 20,000 lb, and one 4,949 lb. All boilers operate at 150 psig.  The boiler plant has an operational range from 5,500 lbs/hr when the piers are empty to 50,000 lbs/hr when an aircraft carrier and other ships are at the pier. Primary fuel source for the boilers is natural gas with No. 2 fuel oil as backup.  The plant uses water treated with a softener/dealkalizer system that consists of two dual trains (two tanks each) and three transfer pumps. The treated water is stored in a 25,000-gallon tank before use. Make-up for the steam distribution system is 100% with only minor condensate returns. There are six feed water pumps, an air compressor and single refrigerating unit used to provide air for the boiler controls, a 113,000 gallon above ground fuel oil tank, and a 230 kW diesel generator.  Note: The steam generation and distribution system includes a compressed air system located in the same building. The compressed air distribution system provides compressed air to ships and the corrosion control facility and consists of approximately 7,350 linear feet of compressed air distribution piping and associated valves. The compressed air system provides 4,000 cubic feet per minute (cfm) of dry, medium pressure air (150 psig) to the pier and the corrosion control facility. The compressed air system compressors are housed in a 3,777 square foot partition of Building 2300. There are two 1,000 cfm and one 2,000 cfm compressors. After the three receivers, the air is piped through a 10-inch line to a refrigerated air dryer. After the air dryer, there is an emergency cross connection into the boiler plant instrument air system for boiler plant use in emergencies.  Spray water is returned from the cooling tower and used to cool the compressors. The compressors utilize a four-pass, shallow tube, redundant set of heat exchangers in a closed cooling water system to control temperatures.

<DESC>Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Number N68936-00-G-0001 is for Thin-Pack Parachute Systems, subsystem, components, related assemblies and engineering/logistical support with SEI, Asheville, NC.  Order 0015 is for procurement of a quantity of up to 14 E-2C Thin-Pack Parachute Survival Ensemble (PSE) Systems (P/N 3516AS2000-1), PSE Seat Pan Cushion Assemblies (P/N 3516AS2100-1), PSE Support Pads (P/N 3516AS2400-1), PSE Inertia Reel Strap Assemblies (P/N 3516AS2300-1) and PSE Wear Strip Assemblies (P/N 3516AS2500-1).  Order 0015 is a continuation of the existing production line.  These systems are being procured for NAVICP Philadelphia to be used as spares and replacements in support of the E-2C Program.  The systems being manufactured under this order must be same configuration that SEI is manufacturing to on order 0005 and 0013 of this BOA.  These systems shall be shipped in place at the contractor's facility until notified by the Government of destinations.  This requirement is being negotiated on a sole source basis with SEI as the Thin-Pack drawing packages have proprietary markings making design information unreleaseable.  SEI is the only source currently producing the parachute survival ensembles incorporating the Thin-Pack/Lightweight Environmentally Sealed Parachute Assembly (LESPA) technology. The "Thin-Pack" lightweight systems have a 5 1/2 year repack cycle (versus 240-670 days) with a goal of 27.5 years total life (versus 10 years).  No other source has SEI's unique knowledge and expertise in the Thin-Pack technology for E-2C.  The production of the supplies listed requires a substantial initial investment or an extended period of preparation for manufacture.  Proposed order type: Firm Fixed Price.  FOB Origin.    The PSE are to be delivered to destinations specified by the Thin-Pack Project Office and NAVICP Philadelphia.  Packing, marking and shipping requirements will be covered by separate order under the BOA.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal or quotation, which will be considered by the Agency.  Interested parties other than SEI must respond in writing (via mail, email, or fax) demonstrating the offeror's experience and capabilities in parachutes incorporating the Thin-Pack technology and the level of maintenance support required by the Government. Address: Commander Code 210000D, NAWCWD, Attn: William T. Monckton, 1 Administration Circle, Bldg. 20259, China Lake, CA 93555-6100.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke, MRI Research Facility, proposes to enter into a sole source contract with Bruker Biospin Corp., Manning Park, 15 Fortune Drive, Billerica, MA 01821, for a Gradient Coil Set, 40 Gauss/Centimeter.  The MRI is a shared resource that provides state-of-the art facilities for research in development and application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).  The MRI resources are accessible to all investigators at the NIH and provides technical and material support for research activities conducted within the In Vivo NMR Research Center.  The gradient coil presently in the 4.7T MRI is unable to provide the gradient strengths necessary for high resolution imaging and diffusion tensor imaging.  A new gradient coil is required in order for the MRI to yield better spatial and temporal resolution in studies being performed.  This project deals with performance enhancement of an existing MRI/MRS system manufactured by Bruker-Biospin which will extend the capabilities of the existing instrument.  Acquisition of the proposed component from a source other than Bruker-Biospin, Inc., would require additional modifications to the existing MRI System.  Mandatory requirements of the gradient coil: 1) have a peak gradient strength of at least 35 gauss/cm on all three axes; 2) have an inner diameter of 120mm, outer diameter of less than 285mm; 4) should be actively shielded; 5) capable of operating with the hardware and software currently in the 4.7T scanner; 6) must be compatible with existing equipment.  Bruker Biospin Corp. is the only source known to the Government that can provide the above item with required features and compatibility requirements.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the Governments requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than 1:30 PM EDT on Septermber 11, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This requirement will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The NAICS Code: 334510 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with for format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Firm fixed-price offers are requested under Request for Quotes (RFQ) Solicitation #RAQ024024.  This document incorporates provisions and clauses which are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-08.  This solicitation is set-aside 100% for small business, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services, the Standard Insutrial Classification (SIC) code is 7371 - Computer Programming Services, and the business size standard is $21.0 million. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), Incident Communications Division has a requirement for an open-ended, "Radio Testing Software" that can "expand" and "adapt" to new hardware and tests.  BLM, NIFC is building an Automated Testing Station to perform quick tests on individual hand-held 2-way radios, consisting of FM, AM, and "Project 25 digital" radios.  BLM, NIFC has over 6000 radios that on average are tested about 7 times a year.  Our new system shall have the ability to pass over 500 radios in a single day during our busy season.  Our requirement is for a single, "Project 25" compliant, "Service Monitor" along with a variable DC power supply" to perform all the test functions necessary to be preformed on the radios.  The Service monitor and power shall have functional GPIB (IEEE-488) interfaces to communicate with the computer. The software shall be compatible with a current version of MS Windows Operating System.  The software shall be setup to be user friendly with "Instruction Screens", "Data Entry Screens", and "Help Screens" allowing untrained individual to easily operate the system.  The software shall be capable of accepting new tests and parameters for new radios as our inventories change as well as removing tests no longer required or equipment from the system that is no longer in service.  The software shall employ operator loaded "Macro" programs or "Templates" to adapt our system to the different makes and models of radios that are serviced by the Incident Communications Division. The Government shall own all rights to the software and the rights to modify the program as required.  The software shall be  written in a "Industry Standard" programming language and then to couple it to our LAN and database (MS Access). The programming coding shall be "Modularized" and structured into "Sub-programs" and "Sub-routines" and well "Annotated" for editing purposes.  After the programming is complete the contractor shall provide training classes and training manuals on software use and modification. RADIO TESTING OPERATING PROCEDURES 1st - The radio kits are taken to an Automatic Testing Station, where the radios will be re-programmed by the Automated Test Station Operator using the "Radio Testing Software" and existing software with our test frequencies and parameters. 2nd - Using the "Radio Testing Software" the Operators will load the station's testing parameters by entering the kit number, the software shall check the database, and determine the correct parameters to load; the software shall re-load these parameters with each new kit number. 3rd - The software shall automatically retrieve Incident information from the database via the NIFC LAN or Internet connection.  The software shall automatically update the Incident number and the issue number on each radio kit for every radio.  4th - The operators shall verify radio information from the database with the radio.  5th - The operators shall attach the radio to the test harness to interface the radio to the test station and the operator shall follow the instructions the given by the computer. 6th - The Automated Testing Station shall provide the actual tested values along with a judgement of "pass" or "fail".  This information shall be downloaded to a multidimensional database on the NIFC LAN to be archived and accessed in an easy to read format or recorded in an "on board" database, allowing the information to be printed in an easy to read format for the technicians to use and the data downloaded later to the LAN and stored with additional data input from the technicians for archival purposes. This procedure is repeated for each radio kit. TEST OPTIONS REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED RX  (FM)  - RX  Audio Distortion - This test requires the testing station to generate the radios RX frequency at -77 dBm (or more) RF, modulated with a 1 Khz sine-wave, deviating at 3 Khz Modulation.  Then the testing station has to collect and analyze the speaker audio; help the operator set the radio to "rated audio"; read and record the percentage of distortion to signal; and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test.   - RX  12 dB SINAD - The test station run this test backwards to save time.  This test requires the testing station to generate the radios RX frequency at an RF level of -119 dBm (for example) RF, modulated with a 1 Khz sine-wave, deviating at 3 Khz Modulation.  Then the testing station has to collect and analyze the speaker audio; help the operator set the radio to an adequate audio (unless the audio hasn't been changed since the 1st setting); read and record the percentage (in dB) of signal to noise + distortion (SINAD); and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test.  NOTE:  Because of this backwards method of running "RX 12 dB SINAD" we have to estimate one of the parameters of "RX M.A.B.".  - RX  M.A.B. - The test station both estimates a critical variable input, and runs this test backwards in order to save time.  This test requires the testing station to generate the radios RX frequency at twice the (estimated) level of RF necessary to achieve 12 dB SINAD (-113 dBm, for example), modulated with a 1 Khz sine-wave, deviating at 7 Khz (for example) Modulation.  Then the testing station has to collect and analyze the speaker audio; help the operator set the radio to an adequate audio (unless the audio hasn't been changed since the 1st setting); read and record the percentage (in dB) of signal to noise + distortion (SINAD); and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test.  - RX  Squelch Break - This test may need to have the operator's cooperation to run.  If the radio has an external (user accessible) squelch; the test will need to show him how to set-up the squelch for testing.  Adversely, if the radio has an internal (fixed) squelch; the test station only needs to run the squelch test without bothering the operator.  After that, this test requires the testing station to generate the radios RX frequency at an RF level of -130 dBm (for example) RF, modulated with a 1 Khz sine-wave, deviating at 3 Khz Modulation.  Then the testing station has to collect and register the speaker audio (there shouldn't be any from a squelched radio).  Increase the RF by 2/10ths of a dB every 1/6 second (monitoring the audio).  When any RX audio appears; read and record the RF level (in dBm or  Vrf) generated (at that 1/6th of a second); and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test.  - RX  Standby Current Drain - This test may need to have the operator's cooperation to run.  If the radio has an external (user accessible) squelch; the test will need to show him how to set-up the squelch for testing "Standby Current".  Adversely, if the radio has an internal (fixed) squelch; the test station only needs to run the "Standby Current" test without bothering the operator.  Either have the operator set the radio to "tight squelch" or rely on the internal squelch of the radio.  The Test Station will then turn off your generated RF so the radio completely squelches; read and record the current of the battery eliminator (running off the DC Power Supply); and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test. TX  (FM)  - TX  Audio Distortion - This test requires the testing station to generate a 1 Khz sine-wave, at a level (35 mVrms, typically) that would modulate an FM radio to about 3Khz deviation.  Then the testing station has to output a ripple-free ground to transmit the radio; collect the RF output and demodulate it; analyze the demodulated audio; read and record the percentage of distortion to signal; and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test.  - TX  Modulation Limiting - This test requires the testing station to generate a 1 Khz sine-wave, at a level (250 mVrms, typically) that would modulate an FM radio to it's full deviation.  Then the testing station has to output a ripple-free ground to transmit the radio; collect the RF output and measure the modulation (+positive & -negative); read and record the modulation in "Khz of deviation" (+positive & -negative); and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test.  - TX  CTCSS Modulation - Running this test will require the testing station to shut off it's TX audio. Then the testing station will have to output a ripple-free ground to transmit the radio; collect the RF output and measure the level of the filtered sub-audible tone under 300 hz (+positive & -negative); read and record the modulation in "Hz of deviation" (+positive & -negative); and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test.  - TX  CTCSS Frequency Error - Running this test will require the testing station to shut off it's TX audio.  Then the testing station will have to output a ripple-free ground to transmit the radio; collect the RF output and measure the frequency of the filtered sub-audible tone under 300 hz; subtract it's frequency from the expected tone frequency; read and record the difference in "Hz of Frequency Error" (+positive or -negative); and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test.  - TX  Wattage Out - This test requires testing station to output a ripple-free ground to transmit the radio; collect the RF output; read and record the wattage of the transmitted RF; and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test.  - TX  Current Drain - This test requires testing station to output a ripple-free ground to transmit the radio; read and record the current of the battery eliminator (running off the DC Power Supply); and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test.  - TX  Frequency Error - This test requires the testing station to generate a 1 Khz sine-wave, at a level (100 mVrms, typically) that would modulate an FM radio.  Then the testing station has to output a ripple-free ground to transmit the radio; collect the RF output; read the frequency of the carrier, mathematically compare the measured frequency of the carrier to the actual frequency assigned to the radio; record the difference between the 2 figures; and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test. RX  (Digital)  - RX Digital B.E.R. (Bit Error Rate) - This test will require the testing station to generate the radios RX frequency at an RF level of -119 dBm (for example) RF, modulated with an APCO Project 25 compliant digital test signal.  Then either the radio or the testing station will have to collect and analyze the decoded digital information from the radio; then either the operator or the testing station must read and record the percentage (in dB) of signal to noise + distortion (SINAD); and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test. TX  (Digital)  - TX Digital B.E.R. (Bit Error Rate) - This test will require the testing station to tell the operator to activate the APCO Project 25 compliant digital test signal.  Then either the radio or the testing station will have to collect and analyze the decoded digital information from the radio; then either the operator or the testing station must read and record the percentage (in dB) of signal to noise + distortion (SINAD); and finally record a judgment of "pass" or "fail" on the test. Software shall be delivered FOB Destination to the the National Interagency Fire Center, Bureau of Land Management, 3833 South Development Avenue, Boise, ID  83705 no later than December 6, 2002.  "FOB Destination" means that all costs for transportation or freight from the shipping point shall be paid by the Contractor and included in the unit price.

<DESC>The U.S.  Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) for renewal of membership services.  The membership provides the NRC with full participation in all North American Technical Center (NATC) and Information System on Occupational Exposure (ISOE) activities, technical reports, and software only available to member regulatory agencies in accordance with ISOE/NEA terms and conditions. The NRC received occupational exposure data from NRC licensees based on the reporting requirement of 10 CFR 20.2206.  These data are maintained in the Radiation Exposure Information and Reporting System (REIRS).  REIRS does not include international occupational exposure data or techniques and experiences by licensees and other regulators on occupational exposure reduction.  The NRC uses this information to 1) compare and contrast U.S. and foreign nuclear power plant initiatives, 2) identify and adopt best-practices during common maintenance and operation procedures, 3) provide exposure trends by country, by reactor type, or by other criteria such as sister-unit grouping, 4) perform cost-benefit analysis, and 5) optimize ALARA objectives.  Since the NRC an other foreign regulators use the techniques and experiences in occupational exposure reduction there is a need to establish a system for the collection and maintenance of such information.  NEA is uniquely capable of providing this information. The base period of performance is one year with one (1) one option year.   The proposed contract action is for membership services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 13.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, all capability statements received by September 23, 2002 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 813920.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Dr. Brent Boyack to complete an ongoing effort started previously at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  This effort involves employing the Phenomena Identification and Ranking Tables (PIRT) process to obtain a draft pre-PIRT and final PIRT reports on TRISO coated fuel particles for gas-cooled reactors.  Dr. Boyack successfully facilitated and conducted the first pre-PIRT meeting as part of the NRC project.  He is uniquely qualified to complete this work because he possesses the expertise on employing the PIRT process.  In 1987, he led the pioneering PIRT effort as part of the Code Scaling, Applicability and Uncertainty (CSAU) project.  Since then he has continued to be involved in the PIRT efforts.  The PIRT process is unique to NRC and no one, other than Dr. Boyack, possesses the expertise to perform this task.  The PIRT process requires facilitation of continuous interaction between expert participants in order to reach a common understanding and identification of the phenomena, process and issue using the standards, such as success criteria, established for that particular project.  Common understanding and identification of the phenomena are very important since the ranking of importance depend on this understanding.  Quality of results strongly depend on the expertise of the facilitator who leads the process.  The second task part of this proposed purchase order is for development of research recommendations for the TRAC-M code to calculate system transients in CANDU reactors.  Dr. Boyack has extensive experience both on the TRAC-M code and CANDU reactors.  He has been the Principal Investigator directing the TRAC-M code development effort at LANL for many years and he has also been the Principal Investigator on a project concerning the thermal hydraulic aspects of CANDU reactors. Dr. Boyack is uniquely qualified also for this part of the work as evidenced by his CANDU and TRAC-M activities over the past 10 years. The period of performance for this effort is estimated to be 7 months. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 13. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all capability statements received by August 15, 2002 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Evangela  Kunene, Procument Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@tda.gov
<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Jordan:  Fixed Line Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance related to the planned liberalization of fixed-line telecommunications services in Jordan.

The Government of Jordan has taken key steps to commercialize and privatize its telecommunications sector.  In 1995, a new telecommunications law created the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission responsible for regulating the sector, and corporatized the state-owned telecommunications provider, creating the public shareholding company Jordan Telecommunications (JT).  The decision to license other operator(s) of fixed-line services presents several difficulties to the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (MoICT).  The economic and demographic characteristics of Jordan will influence the economic viability of further providers of the service.  At the same time, technological developments elsewhere in the world suggest that traditional fixed-line service, and measures such as traditional fixed-line teledensity, may no longer apply, or apply with less force than they did in the past.  The increasing popularity of mobile, GSM telephony is, in some cases, seen as a substitute for the fixed-line.  Its ease of deployment and popularity, combined with its potential means of access to data services, suggest that mobile telephony may be a means to more effectively spread telecommunications services to a wider population in developing economies. 

Recent experience elsewhere in the developed world suggests that the business plan for the provision of traditional fixed-line telephony is under threat.  Typically high international tariffs are being reduced, and even long-distance (or toll) revenues are shrinking for providers of those services.  In the developing world, tariff rebalancing has meant that the tariffs for local calls must increase to offset the loss of international revenues, which is the case in Jordan.  Recent adjustments in the basket of services that represent the obligations of JT show that the fixed cost of a line (monthly subscription) has increased, the number of free calls has decreased slightly, and metered, per-minute charges for local calls have marginally decreased.  The overall effect has been to increase slightly the cost of local service, to offset the decrease in international revenue due to reduction in international tariffs.  The picture is further clouded by the widespread use of voice over internet protocol, which is believed to result in a significant loss of international revenues to JT.  Simultaneously, experience has shown that unmetered access to a telephone line is the key to greatly increased internet access, while the business plan for unmetered access is unproven.  The challenge for providers of these services in Jordan will be considerable, as will the challenge for MoICT to ensure that subscribers enjoy the benefits of competition in their provision.    



The objective of the Technical Assistance is to examine the planned liberalization of fixed-line telecommunications services in Jordan.  The tasks for the Technical Assistance are summarized as follows:  1) legal and regulatory assessment, 2) technical/technology assessment, 3) economic and market assessment, 4) financial analysis, 5) environmental assessment, 6) risk assessment, and 7) final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $417,252 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 3:00 P.M., Monday, October 21, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<SUBJECT>B -- Coastal Environmental and Natural Resource Economics
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-AMD-0002-dh
<RESPDATE>091902
<ARCHDATE>09192002
<CONTACT>Diane Husereau, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-713-0839 x102, Fax (301) 713-0809, Email diane.c.husereau@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOAA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Resources for the Future, an independent non-profit research institute located in Washington, DC. using simplified acquisition procedures.  The purchase order is to augment work already underway in the areas of coastal environmental and natural
resource economics to support policy, management, and operational
decision making with respect to: 1) NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) Habitat Protection program; and 2) NOAA's Chesapeake Bay economics program.

In 2001, NOAA initiated an effort to determine how the NMFS Habitat Conservation program can best utilize economic information and analyses in order to ensure that the greatest benefits are achieved from their programs.  A team of top environmental and natural resource economists was formed to undertake a comprehensive review of the functions and activities of the program to determine the appropriate role for economic
analysis.  This included matching economic analytical methods such as cost/benefit and cost/effectiveness analysis to program objectives and legal authorities.  Case studies of actual decisions were developed covering program activities in areas such as harbor dredging, dam operations, and wetlands fill permitting.
A major policy and research issue emerging from this effort is the role of risk, uncertainty, and cumulative effects in individual habitat planning and response decision making. The work proposed for RFF is to develop a policy relevant model within which risk, uncertainty, and cumulative impacts can be brought to bear on individual, serial, projects.  Factors to be considered within the model are ecosystem services as an underlying framework, fisheries management and the analysis of natural capital and the institutional context of the planning and regulatory decision making. In 2001, NOAA undertook an ambitious education-outreach program with state, local, and Federal planners and managers, NGOs, and industry concerned with Chesapeake Bay environmental and natural resources management.  The purpose is to better understand the principles of economics, economic valuation, economic incentives, economic tools, and economic aspects of natural resource management, particularly in the context of the Chesapeake Bay restoration initiative. The objective is to demonstrate to non-economists how economics can be used to improve policy choices and management tools related to issues such as commercial and recreational fishing, dredging, habitat and fisheries restoration,
recreational boating,. etc.  A team of top environmental and resource economists in the region was formed to develop individual sections dealing with one or more policy actions or management tools.  Given the amount of funding to the effort, original research is not called for. Rather, the effort is to assess and synthesize exisiting research, with a premium on clarity of presentation and expertise.

The work proposed for RFF in this effort is to extend these individual sections to three additional areas: 1) costs and benefits of fish consumption advisories; 2) market-based land use policies for improving water quality; and 3) using price instruments to improve water qualityin the Bay.  RFF is also to use its institutional presence in the region as a top natural resource research institution to help in the outreach to the Bay management and user community.
Resources for the Future (RFF) is Uniquely Qualified.
RFF is the nation's premier independent nonprofit institute addressing natural resource and environmental issues.
The mission of Resources for the Future is to improve environmental and
natural resource policy making worldwide through objective science
studies of the highest caliber. For over 50 years, RFF has pioneered the application of economics as a tool to develop more effective policies for solving environmental, energy, and natural resources problems. RFF's work frequently focuses on harnessing the power of market-like incentives to change behavior, often
in tandem with government regulations, to correct what economists view as the failure of
markets to fully address environmental externalities.  RFF research has been instrumental in the identification and adoption of innovative techniques for pollution control, such as pollution taxes, marketable discharge permits, and deposit-refund schemes.  RFF researchers pioneered the idea of market-based and basin-wide approaches to water quality regulation.   RFF
also has a decades-long history of analyzing innovative trading schemes involving SO2, fisheries, water quantity, land use, wetlands, and carbon and other greenhouse gases, and has been extensively involved in the design, analysis, and evaluation of air quality trading under the Clean Air Act.  RFF researchers are active in many issues, including the development
of instruments and analyses for improving water quality, whether
directly though water trading, or indirectly by affecting land use. Some of these analyses are specific to the Chesapeake Bay as well as Habitat protection and habitat economics.

RFF is an independent, nonpartisan institution, addressing real-worldissues; committed to rigorous technical and research standards; and the ability to communicate results and policy analysis in a timely and understandable manner; and the
researchers themselves, who are highly respected in their fields.
RFF researchers routinely adopt interdisciplinary approaches to
problems, developing and applying sophisticated tools for the analysis of environmental and natural resource issues. RFF researchers have been leaders in evaluating and identifying policy options as well as methodologies to measure benefits and costs.   RFF's emphasis on the development of rigorous
analytical methods characterizes its studies, as has its perception of the systemic nature of problems.  SEE NOTE 22

<DESC>NOAA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Stratus Consulting, Boulder., using simplified acquisition procedures for the next phase of a corroborative study of US
household demand for and benefits derived from improvements in hurricane
weather forecasting. The proposed contractor, 
will build on Phase I work involving background work, literature review,
focus groups, and preliminary survey design. The
proposed Phase II work will include final survey design and preparation
of materials for and submission for OMB review. This will include (1)
survey instrument revision and external expert review based on results
from the Phase I pre-test, (2) one-on-one debriefings and subsequent
survey revision, and (3) preparation of materials for and submission for
OMB review as per the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (5 CFR 1320).   The proposed contractor has unique
qualifications and has specific past experience developing benefit
estimates for weather forecasting services, including conducting the
only known study of households' values for improved day-to-day weather
forecasts. They have undertaken considerable work on
the development of a survey instrument
to elicit households' values for improved hurricane forecasts and has
ongoing work to further refine and develop this survey instrument.
The above provides them with unique qualifications in having the requisite
background on eliciting households' values for and perceptions of
hurricane forecasts in order to continue development of the survey
design.  Further their experience with
implementation
of nonmarket valuation techniques using methods from cognitive survey
design including focus groups, one-on-one verbal protocols and
retrospective analyses, content analysis and factor analysis along with integrated with developing methodologies of stated
preference benefit
estimation including proprietary data analysis programs used in the
weather forecast valuation analysis. The qualifications of Stratus
Consulting have been demonstrated in work for NOAA, USFWS, and EPA in
developing benefit
estimation for air and water quality, reducing environmental health
risks, reducing acid deposition impacts on public monuments, reducing
environmental impacts at Superfund sites, as well as valuation of
ecosystem services and functions.  They conducted the only non-market valuation study of
households' preferences for current and improved day-to-day weather
forecasts. In order to do this work Stratus Consulting has reviewed the
extant literature on weather forecast values and developed the only
economically valid and reliable survey instrument for eliciting these
values
for day-to-day forecasts. Stratus Consulting will continue building on
this work for development of valuation methods for hurricane forecasts.  SEE NOTE 22

The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror?s ability to perform the effort described in this RFQ, based on the offeror?s demonstrated present and past performance.  The assessment process will result in an overall risk rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, neutral, marginal, or unsatisfactory.  Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating ?neutral? meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.  (D) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFQ.  (E) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have an exceptional performance risk rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.  Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.  (F) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of ?very good? or lower.  In that event, the contracting officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) has a requirement for a Resident Research Associateship Program.  The purpose of this program is to provide Post-Doctoral students and engineers of unusual promise and ability opportunities for research on problems t hat are compatible with the interests of ARL.  ARL intends to negotiate with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)/National Research Counsil (NRC) 2101 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20418, under the authority of 10 USC 2304, only one responsib le source.  NAS is uniquely qualified to perform this work by virtue of their Congressional charter, which was established in 1863 to act as an official, yet independent, advisor to the Federal Government in matters of science and technology.  NAS is the o nly organization with sufficient scientific status that leading U.S. and foreign scientists would seek to become affiliated as research associates under its name.  Under this proposed contract, NAS will establish and oversee a multidisciplinary advisory co mmittee, to analyze and make recommendations on ARL research efforts in such diverse areas as computational and information sciences, human research and engineering, sensors and electron devices, night vision and electronic sensors, photonic research, and weapons and material.  The period of performance is expected to be sixty months.  All responsible sources may submit a bid or proposal which will be considered by the agency.  No telephone requests will be honored.  (SEE NOTE 22).

Cygnus lead personnel have over 6 years experience with MDL ISIS and ChemScape software, over two years supporting the NLM ChemIDplus database, and over 6 years with the chemical information and literature scanning part of the anti-HIV program at NIAID.  Cygnus personnel have had previous experience in this product and the software used to support it. Cygnus personnel also have experience in the NIAID chemical biological systems, including HIV/AIDS data of interest to NLM. Cygnus has previously doubled the number of chemical structures in ChemIDplus, as well as provided quality control on the data previously added. SIS needs upgrades to handle the more complex user chemical structure query capabilities that are planned by SIS. Cygnus has a combination of Chemical Structure and Biomedical Information and Chemscape, ISISHost, ISISDirect, Oracle, and Unix/NT expertise that is not available in the other SIS contractors, and continuation will allow this work to be done collaboratively in an expeditious manner to enhance the public ChemIDplus System. The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner that will be considered by NLM.

Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information.

<DESC>NA The Defense Contracting Command-Washington (DCCW) Health Affairs Division, on behalf of the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), currently intends to acquire technical, analytical, and database maintenance and management support for a base year plus four opt ions years to update and maintain MIL-STD-1691 database and the CD-RMS. Military Standard 1691, Construction and Material Schedule for Military Medial and Dental Facilities, provides a schedule of equipment for medial and dental facilities.  The information contained in the standard applies to military construction budgets and  is used to identify equipment requirements for construction and renovation planning.  We contemplate this to be a Firm-Fixed-Price contract. This update and maintenance contract will ensure the currency of the standard with the prevailing standard of practice in both medicine and dentistry.  All information for items contained in the MIL-STD-1691 is to be updated every four (4) years and in the  case of high dollar items every two (2) years.  The contract will require the review of price, model, utility, description and nomenclature of defined equipment.  The contract will identify obsolete items and recommend their replacement or deletion and wi ll include the addition of new items to the standard. The output of the contract will be a quarterly database to the Government that will reflect changes and allow for inclusion of said changes in the Space and Equipment Planning Systems (SEPS).  This is the primary tool used in the planning of new and renova ted medical and dental facilities.  The second output requirement is a set of MIL-STD-1691 catalog cut sheets for all items contained in the standard.  These cut sheets are to be provided biannually. The solicitation number is RFP# DASW01-02-R-0035 at web sites http://www.tricare.osd.mil/contracting/tmamenu.cfm and http://www.dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil.  The solicitation web posting date is expected to be on or about 10 September 2002.  Work is anticipated  to begin on or about 30 September 2002.  Work is currently being performed by SRA International Inc.

STATEMENT OF WORK
IN SUPPORT OF THE 
820th Security Forces Group (820 SFG)

1.0	INTRODUCTION

1.1.  Purpose.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain and sustain a service contract in order to maintain and repair our assigned ATVs (48 each) for worldwide deployments and deployment training.

1.2.  Background.  ATV?s are authorized equipment items on all our Unit Type Codes (UTC) supporting three Force Protection Squadrons with a worldwide mobility mission.  In executing the unit mission of providing a secure operating environment at forward airfields, the 820 SFG must deploy operational ATVs to austere locations.  These vehicles are used daily for installation patrols, security missions, supply runs, rations deliveries, ammunitions re-supply, water re-supply, transporting casualties and enemy prisoners, and numerous other functions during a deployment.  In addition, during in-garrison training these assets must be operational for certification training, which is mandated by Federal Statutes.  The serviceability of the assigned ATVs is critical for mission success.         

1.3.  Scope.  This SOW addresses the service provided to the 820 SFG whom ever is selected to support this SOW.

This includes but is not limited to tires, wheels, spark plugs, spark plug wires, carburetor parts, brake parts and pads, brake cables, brake levers, shift levers, throttle cables, choke cables, headlamp assemblies, ignitions, oil filters, air filters and YTX 14 BS batteries.

2.3.  Contractor will perform work in a reasonable amount of time.  Although the 820th SFG attempts to keep ATVs in a high state of readiness, said contractor must be prepared to support short notice maintenance requirements.  

2.4.  Contractor shall have the capability to perform general/specialized maintenance on multiple ATV simultaneously.

2.5.  Contractor shall assume responsibility for any loss or damage to ATVs while on contractor premises (this includes loading/unloading of ATVs, fire, theft, dents and cuts).

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  A SOLICITATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The C/KC-135 Aircraft Division is conducting market research to determine the existence of potential business sources to overhaul and install TF33-PW102 engine struts on the KC-135E aircraft. The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source (The Boeing Company) under the authority of FAR 6.302. A determination by the Government whether or not to compete this proposed contract based on the responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A firm fixed price requirements type contract is contemplated.  The contract period is anticipated to be one year with three priced one-year options (Oct 02 through Sep 06).  The estimated quantity of struts to be overhauled is 500.  The annual fiscal year options are anticipated to be based on quantity per year with a quantity range per month.  
The intent of the requirement is to remove existing struts from the aircraft, overhaul to a single configuration, and re-install the on the aircraft.  Differences in configurations exist in the KC-135E fleet today due to the variety of commercial airline sources of donor struts. Contractor must possess experience in both KC-135 and commercial 707 heavy sheet metal/structural technology in order to remove, repair and reinstall the struts.  The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has recently developed material changes for major structural components that must be incorporated into the overhaul, inspection, repair, overhaul and install struts.  The contractor shall provide all necessary engineering/technical and maintenance expertise.  Potential contractors will be responsible for all parts, tooling/support equipment, and technical data. Access to valid OEM?s engineering design data for both the KC-135 and commercial 707 must be documented.  Contractors may be required to obtain an Associate Contractor?s Agreement (ACA) with the Boeing Company to obtain access to original design data.  Stress analysis, durability analysis and damage tolerance assessment is required to ensure overhauled struts meet structural requirements. Contractors will be responsible for (2-4) prototypes and establishment of a government controlled rotable pool (estimated 2 months supply) of both inboard and outboard struts. The contractor will repair any discrepancies with all structural elements or system components disturbed during the overhaul and installation.  Contractors will provide all facilities and equipment (airfield, facilities, hangars, maintenance stands, test equipment, paint/depaint facility, and manufacturing back shop). The contractor must have qualified personnel to configure the aircraft and operate aircraft systems required to conduct operational/flight checks.

<SUBJECT>B--FISH VOUCHERING SERVICES
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with The Smithsonian Institute, Office of Sponsored Projects, 750 9th Street N.W., Suite 9200, Washington, DC 20560 to perform careful and detailed fish vouchering services to verify and validate the taxonomic identification of aquatic vertebrates from samples collected in U.S. western streams and rivers and to preserve portions of the samples as permanent archival records for future reference and use in a scientific/fish museum (assuming 5 voucher samples per site and a maximum of 117 sites or 585 samples)) for the current period ending 09/30/02 and two remaining 12 month option periods.  The Smithsonian currently provides these samples under a valid purchase order and the additional samples would allow for a uniform presentation of data to complete on-going tasks.  The Smithsonian has historical experience in providing this service and continued support will ensure consistency and comparability of samples. EPA believes that the Smithsonian is the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirements stated above.    The circumstance permitting "Other than Full and Open Competition" is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".   All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  Interested parties shall: 1) include information on the proposed services which clearly supports the requirements outlined above; 2) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Submit response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105-02),  Attn: Robin S. Harris, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.  Email address: harris.robin@epa.gov. Any information must be received by 12:00 PM on September 20, 2002. If no affirmative responses are received by the deadline  to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, the current purchase order with the Smithsonian will be modified.

TECHNICAL PROVISIONS

GROWING SEASON BURN SEED HARVESTING CONTRACT


TP-01.  SCOPE OF WORK: The contractor shall furnish all labor and materials to remove approximately 300,000 lbs of native-plant-material seed and 600 lbs of Lopsided Indiangrass seed.  The native-plant-material area encompasses approximately 928 acres and the lopsided Indiangrass area consists of 182 acres.

TP-02.  LOCATION OF PROPERTY: The areas to be harvested are located throughout the Avon Park Air Force Range, Florida.  Detailed maps will be provided to prospective bidders and the selected contractor will receive delineated aerial photos of harvest sites..


TP-03.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:

The contractor will be allowed to harvest approximately 300,000 pounds of native vegetation and seed on the growing-season-burn tract and 600 lbs of Lopsided Indiangrass on the other tract.

	1. Growing-season-burn harvest.  The contractor will use a mower to harvest all vegetation down to a 16-inch height above the ground on the specified tracts.  Harvesting will be done in a pattern that alternates between mowed rows and unmowed rows, ensuring that approximately one-half of the site is harvested.  Cut material will be collected either by hand or with mechanized hay-making equipment.

	2.  Lopsided Indiangrass.  The contractor will collect seed either by hand, utilize a Flayal Vac or Combine, cutting material at 30? or higher.  Harvest of the Indiangrass will start 1 October and end 1 November.

b.  The contract will start 1 October 2002 and end on 30 December 2002. 

d.  Harvesting can begin within 10 working days after advance payment is made.  

e. 	The area shall be cleaned and then inspected by the Rangeland Specialist before moving to a new location.  Areas which are determined to be excessively wet by the Rangeland Specialist shall be worked at a later period of time.

f.   Areas not designated for harvest may not be entered by the contractor.  If sites not in the contract are harvested or otherwise damaged through negligence by the contractor's operations, damages will be assessed at rate of $100.00 per acre of land impacted.  Damaged acreage determinations will be done with Global Positioning System equipment by the Rangeland Specialist.

TP-04.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

a.  The Installation Supervisory Rangeland Specialist shall be contacted either in person or by telephone (863-452-4119, extension 305) prior to performing work under this contract.

b.  To avoid any conflicts with other natural resources programs, endangered species, wetlands, or the flying mission of the Air Force, the Rangeland Specialist will approve all haul roads and trailer locations.  The Rangeland Specialist will also determine which stand will be harvested first and the harvesting order of the other stands.  Harvesting or starting of work may be restricted to certain periods time to coincide with the natural resources management program or the military mission of the Air Force Range.  Harvesting can only be conducted Monday through Thursday.  Work may temporarily be halted or the contract terminated if a conflict, deemed serious by the Base Rangeland Specialist, occurs or was unforeseen.   If the contract is terminated through no fault of the contractor, the complete bid deposit submitted by the contractor shall be refunded.

c.  All environmentally sensitive areas shall be avoided by all of the contractor's operations.  No activity of any sort shall be allowed by the contractor within the areas as designated on the attached map.  The Base Rangeland Specialist will identify the boundaries of these sensitive areas prior to initiation of work.

d.  All work shall be accomplished by the contractor's personnel and with the contractor's equipment and materials.  All equipment needed for native seed harvesting operations shall be furnished, transported, and maintained by the contractor.

e.  At all times when operations are in progress, the contractor shall have a representative readily available in the area who will be authorized to receive, on behalf of the contractor, any notices or instructions given by the Air Force in regard to performance under this contract.  He shall also have a copy of the map and technical provisions on the site at all times.

TP-05.  INSPECTION: All work is subject to inspection by the Air Force both during and after the contractor's operation.  Unsatisfactory work shall be corrected promptly.

TP-06.  DAMAGE TO AIR FORCE PROPERTY: Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid damaging trees, shrubs, roads, bridges, culverts, fences, utility lines, buildings, or other structures.  Any associated debris accumulated  from the harvest operations shall not be left in roads, trails, ditches, disc lines, or fire breaks.  Air Force property damaged beyond normal wear and tear shall be replaced at the original condition as directed, at no expense to the Air Force. All repairs will be inspected and accepted or rejected by the Air Force. The damage to haul roads while standing water is present or road surfaces are soft from moisture will not be considered as normal wear and tear.

TP-07.  NEW CONSTRUCTION: All new construction by the contractor or subcontractor must be approved by the Air Force before construction begins.

TP-08.  FOREST FIRE SUPPRESSION: The contractor shall exercise due diligence both independently and in cooperation with the Air Force and will take all reasonable and practical action to prevent and suppress forest fires on the contract area or vicinity.  The contractor agrees to reimburse the Air Force for the cost of fire suppression incurred as a result of his negligence and/or willful acts.  All fires shall be reported immediately to the Base Rangeland Specialist.

TP-09.  EXAMINATION OF PREMISES: Bidders are expected to satisfy themselves as to the general location that may affect the cost of performance under this contract.  It is considered impractical to determine by other means the exact nature of the work, site conditions under which the work is to be performed, product breakdown and total quantity to be harvested.  The submission of a bid will be considered as certification that the site has been inspected and the nature of work and the effects of existing and/or adjacent work has been determined.  Inspection of the sites is invited between 8:00 AM. and 3:00 P.M., Monday through Friday (legal holidays excluded), by arrangements with the Base Rangeland Specialist, telephone  (863-452-4119, extension 305).

TP-10.  TRASH AND REFUSE: Trash and refuse resulting from the contractor's operations shall either be removed daily and disposed of on the installation at locations and in a manner as directed by the Base Rangeland Specialist or be carried out by the contractor.  No trash of any sort (tires, oil buckets, etc.) shall be left on the ground at the end of the day.

TP-11.  PAYMENT AND BIDDING:

a.  The basis for payment is pounds of native seed material. Payment shall be made weekly.  A check made payable to the "Treasury of the United States" along with invoice tickets shall be submitted to 347 RQW, DET 1, OL A/CEVN, 29 South Boulevard, Avon Park Air Force Range, Florida 33825-5700, Attention: R. Scott Penfield.

b.  Each truckload of material that leaves the Avon Park Air Force Range may be required by the Air Force to leave a load ticket at a designated location.  If this option is required, the  Rangeland Specialist will inform the contractor of the proper procedure and information needed to meet this requirement.

TP-12.  UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE: The contractor is cautioned that unexploded
ordnance and unburned flares may exist within the contract areas.  The contractor shall assume full responsibility for such property and shall discharge the Government from any and all damages directly and indirectly resulting from such property.  The contractor also agrees to hold the Government harmless from any and all claims arising therefrom or incident thereto.  When found, these objects shall not be tampered with or removed.  The contractor shall immediately report these findings to the Base Rangeland Specialist so proper identification and disposal can be made by the Government.

TP-13.  COMPLETION:

a.  The Base Rangeland Specialist shall notify the Contracting Officer when all operations required under this contract are satisfactorily completed.  In the event that the contractor is unable to complete removal of all native seed material designated for removal under this contract, the Rangeland Specialist may, if in his opinion the contractor made diligent effort to complete harvesting, recommend an extension of the contact as specified in Paragraph TP-03c.

b.  All equipment, supplies, etc., belonging to or used by the contractor or subcontractor shall be removed from the Avon Park Air Force Range within 10 days after completion of work.  Rent will be charged at the rate of $20.00 per day per piece of equipment after the 10-day period has expired.

To avoid any conflicts with other natural resources programs, endangered species, wetlands, or the flying mission of the Air Force, the Rangeland Specialist will approve all haul roads and trailer locations.  The Rangeland Specialist will also determine which stand will be harvested first and the harvesting order of the other stands.  Harvesting or starting of work may be restricted to certain periods time to coincide with the natural resources management program or the military mission of the Air Force Range.  Harvesting can only be conducted Monday through Thursday.  Work may temporarily be halted or the contract terminated if a conflict, deemed serious by the Base Rangeland Specialist, occurs or was unforeseen.   If the contract is terminated through no fault of the contractor, the complete bid deposit submitted by the contractor shall be refunded.

c.  All environmentally sensitive areas shall be avoided by all of the contractor's operations.  No activity of any sort shall be allowed by the contractor within the areas as designated on the attached map.

TP-11.  PAYMENT AND BIDDING:

a.  The basis for payment is pounds of native seed material. Payment shall be made weekly.  A check made payable to the "Treasury of the United States" along with invoice tickets shall be submitted to 347 RQW, DET 1, OL A/CEVN, 29 South Boulevard, Avon Park Air Force Range, Florida 33825-5700, Attention: R.

ordnance and unburned flares may exist within the contract areas.

The contractor also agrees to hold the Government harmless from any and all claims arising therefrom or incident thereto.  When found, these objects shall not be tampered with or removed.  The contractor shall immediately report these findings to the Base Rangeland Specialist so proper identification and disposal can be made by the Government.

 

TP-13.  COMPLETION:
a.  The Base Rangeland Specialist shall notify the Contracting Officer when all operations required under this contract are satisfactorily completed.  In the event that the contractor is unable to complete removal of all native seed material designated for removal under this contract, the Rangeland Specialist may, if in his opinion the contractor made diligent effort to complete harvesting, recommend an extension of the contact as specified in Paragraph TP-03c.
