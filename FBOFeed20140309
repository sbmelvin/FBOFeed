<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is contemplating the award of a contract on an "Other than Full &amp; Open Competition" basis to Medgate, Inc. in accordance with FAR part 6.302-1(b). The basis for this contemplation is that only one responsible source and no other supplies/services will satisfy agency requirements. The requirement is as follows:
<p>This contract is intended to provide the necessary "licensing" support in the use of a comprehensive electronic occupational medicine and preventive healthcare service "software" system installed several years ago and upgraded over the past couple of years. This system provides a mechanism to track services including, but not limited to in-service physical examinations, preventive programs, injury/illness investigations, occupational health surveillance programs, employee counseling services, and exposure monitoring activities primarily for employees in the Atlanta area. In FY 2008 14,000 visits were made to CDC's Occupational Health clinics, and during these visits, approximately 19,000 services were provided. Comprehensive occupational healthcare services are provided to a wide array of laboratorians, international travelers, engineering services employees, and animal care workers. While the majority of clinic patient visits are for immunizations, work-related injury and illness care, and compliance exams in support of worker protection programs, and a large number of services are provided to prepare deployable teams of public health emergency responders. This system will also track all exposure monitoring of work spaces on Atlanta CDC campuses as well. The continued support and access to this system is crucial to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The Medgate system assists CDC with health and safety regulatory compliance. More importantly, the system supports Environment, Safety and Health Compliance Office (ESHCO) in identifying risk, preventing injury and illness, and ensuring the health, safety and wellness of the workforce. Medgate GX is an Occupational Health and Safety System. The system uses the Microsoft .NET Framework for the GUI. The database will reside on the consolidated Microsoft SQL Server. Medgate would provide CDC the following Suites in support of the system; an Occupational Health package, a Safety package, an Industrial Hygiene package, Training Package, as well as an Ergonomic Package.</p>
<p>The initial version of Medgate software was purchased through CEW, Inc. in 2004; subscription, implementation and upgrades were purchased through CSC, the prime Occupational Health Clinic contractor. Following the initial purchase of the system, Medgate subscription costs were covered within the scope of the prime Occupational Health Clinic contract. The period of performance was August 1, 2004 through October 31, 2011; following October 31, 2011 contracts between CDC and Medgate were established for continued subscription, technical guidance and training support on the established system. The system has completed the extensive Certification and Accreditation process through CDC's Office of the Chief Information Officer and is authorized for use in production. The "licensing" and subsequent support to this proprietary system can only be provided by Medgate, Inc.</p>
<p>The anticipated performance period of the contract contemplated will not exceed two years from the date of contract award. It is believed that Medgate, Inc. possesses the capability and is uniquely qualified to perform this requirement as stated above. All responsible sources that believe they should be considered qualified to provide the services may submit a response by no later than 2:00pm EST, on March 24, 2014 by e-mail to Lisa Lombard at LPL0@CDC.GOV (that is LPL ZERO).</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840

If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the HQ AMC-Level Protest Procedures. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>Term is mandatory for lodging and hotel requirements. 
This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.
