<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract to contribute to the knowledge base that is needed for public officials to pursue balanced decision making in the management and development of Federal sand borrow areas identified for use in nearby beach nourishment coastal restoration projects and HEREBY SOLICITS REQUESTS FOR REQUESTS  FOR PROPOSALS from interested parties to propose on this requirement. INTRODUCTION: The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement-type contract.  The Solicitation Number for this requirement is 1435-01-04-RP-34396 and must be referenced on your written documents.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  All offerors must be able to qualify under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990 (Professional, Scientific and Technical Studies) size standard $6.0M.  The United States (U. S.) Government, and specifically, the Minerals Management Service (MMS), a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Federal OCS.  Public Law 103-426, enacted October 31, 1994, gave the MMS the authority to convey, on a noncompetitive basis, the rights to OCS sand, gravel, or shell resources for shore protection, beach or wetlands restoration projects, or for use in construction projects funded in whole or part or authorized by the Federal Government.   MMS has been actively cooperating with coastal states in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico during the conduct of geologic and geophysical studies to identify potential offshore sand sites with sufficient quantity and the required quality of sand needed for planned and future beach and coastal restoration projects. Since enactment of PL 103-426, MMS has provided Federal sand for beach nourishment projects in New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana.  The prospect of developing OCS areas as sand borrow sites for beach and coastal restoration presents some potential for conflict with local commercial and sport fishermen. In addition to potentially disturbing the habitats of the fish present in an area during the dredging process to remove the sand from the borrow site, the presence of operating dredges and the associated transit to and from the sand discharge points could create navigational obstacles where fishermen typically conduct their activities. This may well result in diminished access to favorable fishing areas and a loss of harvest. The MMS, as the administrative agency created to manage and regulate OCS resources has a responsibility to monitor and mitigate impacts that might be associated with resource development.  The intent of this study is to explore and define specific ways to mitigate these potential conflicts and to analyze the significant tradeoffs of reasonable alternative proposals. It will also place the analysis within the broader social context of key dynamic variables, such as recent changes in fishing markets, fishing regulations, fishing technology, navigational safety, beach and coastal restoration activities, offshore dredging technology, and the history of relations and linkages between commercial and recreational fishing and the dredging industry. This study will contribute to the knowledge base that is needed for public officials to pursue balanced decision-making in the management and development of Federal sand borrow areas identified for use in nearby beach nourishment and coastal restoration projects. The study will establish a background that can facilitate in assessing the environmental impacts of offshore dredging on resident commercial and recreational fisheries. The study will provide a comprehensive list of detailed mitigation measures that can be applied to avoid adverse impacts to fisheries that may be present in outer continental shelf (OCS) sand resource areas, regardless of geographic location.  It will identify, develop, and evaluate specific proposals to mitigate or resolve potential spatial conflicts between the commercial and recreational fishing industries and the development of OCS sites as long-term sand borrow areas. It will also explore the possibilities for creating or revising institutional linkages that might facilitate communication and cooperation between the various fishing components, the Minerals Management Service (MMS), and the dredging industry in the future.  SCOPE OF WORK: Specific study tasks will include a world-wide literature search to identify literature sources describing actual conflicts that have occurred, identification and analysis of governmental regulations, guidelines, and procedures enacted by State and local entities within the U.S., and foreign governments that have sought to mitigate adverse conflicts and effects between dredging activities and commercial and recreational fishing interests, identification of offshore areas at risk of spatial conflicts, site visits to fishing, industry, and governmental interests, the conduct of ethnographic fieldwork among commercial and recreational fishery interests and the dredging industry and onboard dredging vessels, and the subsequent production of maps and various reports. The period of performance of the resultant contract will be twenty-four (24) months with a cost range of $200,000 to $250,000.  FOR A COMPLETE SOW FOR THIS RFP, PLEASE CONTACT Sharon Teger at Sharon.Teger@mms.gov by COB April 20, 2004.   Requests should include the name of your organization, point of contact, complete address and phone number.  Please verify receipt with this office.  We are not responsible for transmission not received and verified.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Resources Division, Great Lakes Science Center, has a requirement to make a non- competitive award via written request for quotation No. 04ER08-No Solicitation number for a Contract with Northstar Technical to provide a system to accurately measure trawl geometry during fishing exercises and provide data for analysis of trawl performance is needed to maintain continuity of long term data sets with changes in vessels and trawls. Experience with earlier versions of this type of gear revealed significant shortcomings in products from other manufactures as well as desirable features of the Netmind system. Specifications have been developed from this experience. Northstar Technical is on the cutting edge of creating advanced sonar systems and produces equipment for use in disciplines including defense, oil and gas exploration, and both committed to continually offering users improvements. Northstar Technical is the only company making trawl mensuration gear with a North American Service and Support Center. Gear purchased in the past had to be shipped to Norway for any service at all. This can result in loss of data in the event of equipment failure. Shipment within North America can be accomplished rapidly, and would allow repair of any malfunction in time to complete a survey. The U.S. Geological Survey anticipates awarding this to Northstar Technical.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The anticipated award date is 04/08/2004.  NAICS is 334513 and SIC is 3823.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notice must be submitted via e-mail to: abenton@usgs.gov by 04/08/2004.  No additional synopsis will be published.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for an upgrade of our existing 7300 VSM to a 735 controller based VSM(Vibrating Sample Magnetometer) with new hardware, computer and software including a 2 day installation and training by a Lake Shore engineer.  NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Lake Shore Cryotronics, Inc. at 575 McCorkle Blvd., Westerville, Ohio 43082 only.  Since Lake Shore Cryotronics built our original 7300 VSM controller, they are the best qualified people to know exactly how to build an upgrade VSM controller that interacts smoothly with our existing VSM hardware in the shortest amount of time for the least amount of money.  While VSMs of different makes and models operate on the same general physical principals and even share common components to some extent, each model is unique.  In fact, individual instruments often exhibit unique idiosyncratic behavior.  This is the case with our current 7300 VSM.  This company would be uniquely familiar with all aspects of the equipment being serviced, speeding repair/maintenance time thus reducing overall down time of the instrument.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 23, 2004. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<SUBJECT>A--Minature Digital Data Link for the Dragon Eye UAV System
<SOLNBR>N0001404R0009

<ARCHDATE>06222004
<CONTACT>Mark Chadwick, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-2599, Email chadwim@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research, Expeditionary Warfare Operations Technology Division (ONR 353) will be soliciting proposals for a miniture digital data link for the Dragon Eye UAV System.  The Dragon Eye currently employs an analog data link for sending commands from the Ground Control Station (GCS) to the Air Vehicle (AV), and for sending telemetry and video back from the AV to the GCS.  This link has shortcomings including using a frequency band with poor worldwide availability, short range, and easy interception and exploitation by opposing forces.  The effort that will be described in the Statement of Work (SOW) will be to develop a prototype miniature digital data link for application to the Dragon Eye UAV that will address the shortcomings of the current analog link, build two examples of the prototype system, and confirm its functionality by test and demonstration.  The prototype system is intended to closely resemble a production-ready item: the prototype will be designed to provide not only the functionality of a production item, but also the interfaces required for integration into the Dragon Eye system, including form factor, mass properties, and environmental compatibility.  However, actual integration of the data link into the Dragon Eye system is not within the scope of this effort, nor is qualification testing to verify environmental requirements. In accordance with FAR 5.203, the request for proposals (RFP) will be attached to this presolicitation notice on 20 April 2004.  The RFP will also be available on ONR's web site, www.onr.navy.mil/02/rfps.asp on 20 April 2004.   Once the solicitation is made available, all questions MUST be submitted via e-mail to the point of contact identified in this announcement.

<DESC>The Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) is one of the Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) Facilities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA/AOML is a part of the US Department of Commerce (DOC) and has a requirement to purchase three (3) INVERTED ECHO SOUNDERS for a scientific research cruise to study the Deep Western Boundary current in the Atlantic Ocean east of the Bahama Islands. An Inverted Echo Sounder is an oceanographic instrument system that is moored to the bottom of the ocean and very accurately measures the time it takes for an acoustic pulse to travel from the ocean bottom to the surface and back to the bottom. The instrument is very similar to a ship’s depth sounder that measures the water depth beneath the ship by bouncing acoustic pulses off the ocean bottom, measuring their travel time, and then converting the travel time to an equivalent depth using the speed of sound in water. The inverted echo sounder must have the following operating characteristics:1.Primary Measurements: a. The instrument shall measure the time required for an acoustic pulse to travel from the ocean bottom to the surface and back to the bottom, b. The travel time measurement resolution must be 0.00005 seconds or less, etc. 2:Additonal measurements: a. The instrument must have the ability to measure the ocean water pressure for water depths ranging from 500 meters to 6700 meters, b. Pressure measurement resolution shall be 0.005 decibar or less, etc. 3: Optional measurements: a. The instrument shall be capable of measuring the horizontal water velocity at a single point located within 75 meters of the bottom of the ocean, b. The water velocity measurement shall include the magnitude and azimuth, or equivalently the two horizontal components of the current vector, etc. 4. Data Storage: a. All data storage must be in semiconductor reusable memory such as compact flash card or equivalent, b. All travel time measurements, pressure measurements, temperature measurements, and current velocity measurements if included must be stored such that they can be recovered to full resolution, etc. 5: Data Telemetry: The instrument shall include an acoustic telemetry capability such that anytime following the deployment of the instrument, it may be ascertained if it is collecting valid data, and the data collected to that time can be collected by a surface ship without recovering the instrument, etc. The instrument must be capable of operating in water depths over the range 500 of 6700 meters. The instrument must be capable of operating unattended on the ocean bottom for up to 4 years. This is not a small business set-aside. The NAICS Code is 334514. All interested parties may request a copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP) within fifteen (15) days of its publication. Request must be in writing and faxed to 816-426-7530, Attn: Sharon Walker.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   In accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 Commercial and Simplified procedures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Perkin Elmer  to procure one each of the following Perkin Elmer products: Autosampler-AS-93 PLUS for MAS (Part Number B3140810); Dell GX270 Windows XP, SP1 (Part Number 09403918); 19" Flat Panel Multimedia Monitor (P/N 09404759); Laserjet 4200 (P/N 09421038);  Centronics Cable, PC to Printer (P/N 09410001); Heat Exchanger - 120V 60Hz (P/N N8122248); Sensor Accymultiwave 3000 IR TEMP(5696) (P/N  N3141006);  Sensor Accymultiwave 3000 PRESS/TEMP (P/N N3141005);  Keyboard-USA (6265); (P/N N3141010); Kit-Oxygen Gas MFC (P/N WE028428); Peltier-Cooled Cyclonic Spray Chamber (Special Mas); Plasma Torch (P/N N8122006); Corrosion Resistant Sample Introduction  (P/N WE024782); KIT-SEC DRC2 MFC with  VCR; KIT-E6100 Test Solution (P/N N8125022); Solution E6100 DRC Wash (P/N N8125033); Solution-10ppb Selenium (P/N N8125039) and eight (8) Vessel-Rotors 16HF100 MW3000 (5711) (P/N N3141012).   This equipment is needed to complete a system (Perkin Elmer Elan DRC-II and Multiwave 3000) system that EPA  already possesses.  The completed Perkin Elmer Elan DRC-II ICP-MS will provide EPA with the capability for reducing background interference from specific molecules by introducing a reaction gas into a specially designed chamber (reaction cell) before identification of the mass spectra for the  metals of interest.  This unique feature allows the ultra-low detection limits for some of the specific metals in which EPA is interested (such as arsenic, chromium, and iron).  The components will also allow the Perkin Elmer Elan DRC-II ICP-MS to run unattended overnight in order to analyze large  numbers of samples to the system.  The applicable NAIAS code is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to add functionality to the Perkin Elmer Elan DRC-II  and Multiwave 3000 EPA currently possesses and respond to the office identified above. Documentation must be received by April 19th, 2004 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice  is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to Tammy Adams by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail  adams.tammy@epa.gov to receive consideration for this purchase order. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Dr. Anita Coulter Flowe, Roxboro, NC for professional services supporting the evaluation of the FLUENT CFD software in support of the EPA National Exposure Research Laboratory's (NERL) human exposure modeling program.  The program is to develop and apply human exposure models, and recent technological advances in computing capacities and software developments have made the application of Computation Fluent Dynamics (CFD) simulations practical for supporting  EPA's human exposure modeling program. While CFD software is routinely applied in aerospace and automotive industries, its potential application for human exposure modeling presents additional challenges.  There is a need to develop best practice for the set up and applications of CFD software in  support of human exposure modeling, and also to evaluate the performance of CFD software by comparing model output to appropriate measurements from field and wind tunnel studies.  NERL has a program for developing and evaluating applications of CFD software for a range of human exposure modeling  scales from isolated buildings to a larger urban neighborhood.  This program uses PC's running the LINUX operating system, an SGI Onyx2 workstation, and an IBM  multiprocessor supercomputer with licensed FLUENT CFD Software installed.  The FLUENT CFD software is very specialized with regard to  numerical simulation and graphical presentation, and extensive knowledge of this software and experience in its use are required for performance of these professional services .  This prospective order is for work that is a continuation of work performed by Dr. Flowe under EPA Purchase Order  3D-5097-WTTX. The EPA believes that only Dr. Flowe can complete the work that was initiated under the prior order due to her expertise and the on-going nature of the tasks under the prospective order.  It would be a formidable task for any other person to achieve the level of understanding Dr.  Flowe possesses of research completed under the prior contract.  The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.301-2, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The period of performance is expected to  be from May 2004 until May 2005. This is a non-commercial purchase to be made under full and open competition.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this  announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist and, therefore, no RFQ is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.   Submit your response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105-02), Attn: Rebecca Clausen, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 or e-mail clausen.rebecca@epa.gov.

<DESC>This solicitation is a 100% small business set-aside.  The Defense Supply Center Columbus is soliciting qualified parties to participate in this commercial Part 12 solicitation, for spare parts to be used on A M General Weapons Systems.  The scope of the contract will include DLA managed items, for which AM General is an approved source, or that they have supplied in the past. Items within the scope may be added to the solicitation, or any resulting contract(s) at a later date.  

This solicitation will result in Firm-Fixed-Price, Indefinite-Quantity Contracts for delivery to stock only.  The initial contract period will be two years with one three-year, fixed-price option period.  The estimated two-year base period value is $17,690,247.52, totaling $44,225,618.80 with option. 

FSCs include the following:

FSC	FSC	FSC	FSC	FSC	FSC
1005	2815	3110	4720	5930	5995
1010	2910	3120	4730	5935	5999
1095	2920	3130	4820	5945	6150
2510	2930	3950	4910	5961	6620
2520	2940	4010	5120	5962	6625

2540	3010	4320	5365	5977	
2590	3020	4330	5895	5980	
2805	3040	4710	5905	5985	

Submission of solicitation pricing will be phased – 100 NSNs every 30 days, prioritized by demand and whether or not the NSN is identified for Reset*.  Phased pricing will allow all vendors the opportunity to offer on as many NSNs as possible.  The Government may make multiple awards by NSN where high-density items cannot be supported by a single source of supply.  However, this will ultimately be determined by the competition received.  An all or none clause is not included.  

For NSNs resulting in a single award, the managing activity will issue delivery orders by means of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), using the conventions and formats prescribed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI X12) and the Department of Defense (DoD) Implementation Guidelines.  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will be using a Distribution Point with connections to several Value Added Networks (VANs) for passing transactions to vendors in ANSI X12 format.  Supplies will be ordered using the following EDI Transaction Sets:  

(1)	Transaction Set 850 – Call/Order
(2)	 Transaction Set 810 - Invoice

To determine the offeror(s) that provide the best value to the Government, the Agency will use the trade-off process (instead of the lowest priced technically acceptable source selection process).  

Access to a complete list of NSNs and P/Ns included on this solicitation can be downloaded from: http://www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/corporate_contracts/cc.asp on the date of issue.  It is impracticable to distribute the applicable drawings with the solicitation, however, they will be available at <http://dibbs.dscccols.com/rfp>.   If the drawings are not posted at this web site, see Clause L11D02Availability of Drawings for information on how to obtain the drawings.  FEDERAL, MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS CANNOT BE PROVIDED BY DSCC.

In order to receive drawings for this solicitation you must be JCP certified.  If you do not have a JCP certification number, go to the following web address and download the application, “Military Critical Technical Data Agreement” DD FORM 2345.

Fill out the form following all instructions and mail form to address shown in Battle Creek MI.

*Reset is a major effort to "repair and refit" Army and Marine Corps units that have recently returned from deployment. It involves bringing more than 20,000 wheeled and 3,000 tracked vehicles, every aviation system in Southwest Asia and 300 different command and control systems to a condition where they can be reissued for use by units replacing soldiers redeploying from Iraq or be used to fight another conflict anywhere in the world. The Marine Corps Reconstitution effort, while smaller in scale, is equally important.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Department of the Army in conjunction with the Marine Corps plans to enter into a four year multi-year contract with BAE SYSTEMS of Barrow-in-Furness U.K. for the purchase of a quantity between 456-519 Lightweight 155mm Howitzers (LW155), to be known as the M777.  The LW155 will meet or exceed all M198 requirements while having a substantially lighter weight.  It will be compatible with all current 155mm munitions and be capable of being towed by  the current and future family of 5 ton trucks, being secured aboard naval amphibious vehicles, and being transported by medium lift helicopters, as well as the V-22.  In addition, a single C-130 aircraft will be able to transport two LW155's versus one for the M198.  The reduced weight, emplacement/displacement times and improved mobility of the LW155 result in vastly improved survivability and lethality characteristics over the M198. Each howitzer will be equipped with a digital fire control system, known as Towed Artillery Digitization (TAD).  In addition, the contract will include 94 additional TAD systems for the retrofit of howitzers previously purchased by the Marine Corps.   Parties interested in responding to this announcement may contact John W. Tangalos, Contract Specialist, US ARMY- TACOM, AMSTA-AQ-APG, Bldg. 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000; voice 973-724-3558 or at tangalos@pica.army.mil  Any such responses shall be submitted no later than May 6th, 2004.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source contract. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price type contract to IndaSea, Inc., for a follow on to a research and development effort entitled "Cultural Simulation Model (CMS)" which allows multiple cultural agents to interact to real time data streams which reflect actions of terrorists and non-terrorists.   The CMS evolved from unique capabilities resident within IndaSea regarding the use of autonomous (software) data handlers, and the creation of a technologically revolutionary logic web that allows the same data to be applied simultaneously to modeling interactions on multiple scales ranging from very small (simulation of multiple competing interests with an individual person) to very large (global State interactions).  The logic webs also have the capability to integrate large amounts of live (incoming) data quickly into the simulation itself, affecting the behavior of the computer agents in real time.  Phase I of the CMS resulted in the development of the computer architectural requirements and a working prototype computer model.   Phase II of the project incorporated new data into the model, integrated methods to acquire subject matter expert data, developed system-scaling requirements, continued development of display method, and demonstrated the model.  Phase II devised methods of distributing cultural elements throughout the CSM structures thereby forming an open system allowing inclusion of data from the multiple perspective of various disciplines.  CSM development effectively balanced technical and contextual needs of threat anticipation with the ease of use and understand of the end user.   Phase III of the CMS will expand the successful prototype, expand software, increase input from subject matter experts, and expand live data feeds.  Phase III will result in a computer simulation model capable of receiving live electronic data, modeling cultural interactions between multiple individuals, and displaying the results of the computations to analysts.  Phase III will provide a CSM capable of calculating interactions with the intent of anticipating threats.  IndaSea is the originator, developer, designer and sole user of the autonomous data handler and logic web tools necessary for the continued development of the CMS.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO SUPPLEMENT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY:     

The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to issue a sole source firm fixed price contract to ORBCOMM to obtain Contractor technical and management support services to develop the capability to receive, process and forward the Automatic Identification System (AIS) signal via spacecraft and their associated ground systems in accordance with an International Maritime Organization (IMO) mandated signal. The USCG requires this capability within the next two years. Under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), ORBCOMM is considered to be the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Rev iew all field and laboratory data including undisturbed samples, SPT, CPT, Geophysical Testing and Field Vane Shear Tests to characterize the soil conditions including stratification of material type, and soil strength of the embankment and foundation of E nid Dam considering previous studies of these materials.  The material type that exists in the foundation of the dam and is potentially liquefiable is a silty clay that meets the Chinese criteria for liquefaction of fine-grained soils. The nature and confi guration of these materials are unique in the Mississippi alluvial valley.  Develop and/or update the presentation of this data including figures, plates and tables for final documentation of the field and laboratory data.  These figures, tables and plates  will be utilized in the final Seismic Safety Study Report.  This project is estimated to be below simplified acquisition threshold.  Complete Scope of Work is outlined in Request for Quotations W912EE-04-T-0029, available at: http://www.mvk.usace.army.mil/contract/AdvertisedSolicitations.asp .

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is soliciting information from air particle collector, biological sensor, and taggant technology firms and other interested parties on technology available for providing an affordable approach to use these technologies in the detection and tracking of biological aerosol agents.  Air particle collectors, biosensors, and taggants will become integral parts of a Biological Combat Assessment System (BCAS) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) planned to begin in FY04.  The ACTD schedule and milestones will be to integrate, test, and demonstrate a remote, point-sample collection system in the second quarter of FY05, and a remote, point-sample collection and identification system in second quarter of FY07.  This ACTD will culminate in FY07 in a technology demonstration of a near real-time collection, detection, identification, tracking and characterization system for biological aerosol agents released during counterforce strikes against Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) targets.  Sustainment of the residual assets produced during the ACTD and requisite training for operational personnel will follow in FY08 and FY09.  


Government sponsorship of the BCAS ACTD includes the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and the U. S. Pacific Command (PACOM).  The objective of this Sources Sought is to identify air particle collector, biological sensor, and taggant technological concepts and performance potentials for the BCAS ACTD, which may also be used as the basis for developing the BCAS ACTD performance specification.  This specification may subsequently be provided to industry as part of the anticipated BCAS ACTD solicitation. 

The BCAS ACTD will demonstrate the capability for combat assessment of counterforce strikes against biological weapon production and storage facilities.  The desired combat assessment system will utilize air particle collectors to concentrate samples, and biological sensors for detection and identification of biological agents that are released in a counterforce strike.  The anticipated maximum payload weight threshold for the combination of an air particle collector and biological sensor is less than 20 pounds.  Taggants will be used to facilitate standoff post-strike plume tracking and plume characterization.  The taggants will be incorporated in the strike weapon, to be released upon detonation.  Once released, the taggant must co-migrate with the post-strike plume to facilitate standoff post-strike tracking and characterization.

<SUBJECT>A -- Biological Combat Assessment System Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration for mini Unmanned Air Vehicle
<SOLNBR>DTRA01-03-SS-BCASUAV
<RESPDATE>101703
<CONTACT>Cynthia Sanders, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 325-9210, Fax (703) 325-9294, Email cynthia.sanders@dtra.mil
<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is soliciting information from unmanned air vehicle (UAV) manufacturers, aviation technology firms and other interested parties on aeronautical technology available for providing an affordable approach to use expendable and non-expendable, mini-UAVs to carry sensor payloads for the detection and tracking of aerosolized chemical and biological warfare agents and radiological particles resulting from a Counterproliferation (CP) counterforce weapon strike.  The expendable and non-expendable, mini-UAVs will become integral parts of a Biological Combat Assessment System (BCAS) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) planned to begin in FY04 and end in FY09. 

The BCAS ATD integrates, tests, and demonstrates a remote, point-sample collection sensor system in the second quarter of FY06 (2QFY06), and a remote, point-sample collection, detection, and identification system in the fourth quarter of FY07 (4QFY07). Included in the integration, test, and demonstration capabilities will be satellite and line of sight communication systems; Global Positioning Systems (GPS); optical/infrared real-time video systems; communication collection and relay; and laser designators.  

This ATD will culminate in a technology demonstration of a near real-time sample collection, detection, identification, tracking, characterization, and communication system for Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) aerosolized agents released during counterforce strikes against a simulated WMD target, and performance of battle damage assessment.  In addition, the system will demonstrate the capabilities to perform real-time imagery, signal intelligence (SIGINT), and target designation function during ingress to the target area, loitering over the target area, and egress from the target area to a designated recovery point.

Sustainment of the residual assets produced during the ATD and requisite training for operational military personnel will follow in FY08 and FY09 while the developed capabilities are transitioned into an acquisition program. 
BCAS ATD Concept and System Description

<RESPDATE>060404
<ARCHDATE>08032004
<CONTACT>Tera Sinclair, 586-574-8901
<DESC>Introduction:  The Army has a requirement to repair 3(or possibly 4)LP-12 Well Drilling Rigs and bring them up to acceptable condition so they can be issued to units.  The Army calls this type of program a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).  The standard for repair and refurbishing equipment in a SLEP program is called 10/20 standards.  These 10/20 standards are contained in the Army technical manual for the LP-12 system and can be found in TM5-3820-256-10, pages 2-26 through 2-44.  Copies of the applicable TM pages can be faxed to any interested contractor if they call Bill Down at (586) 574-7893 or Pete Motzenbecker at (586) 574-4299.  The purpose of this market survey is to identify contractors who can perform this type of work and obtain rough estimates as to the cost and time required for this effort. These 3 well drilling rigs were built in the late 1980s and were used by the Navy until recently when the Army acquired them.  For the purpose of this market survey, the contractor should assume normal wear and tear for equipment that is 15 to 17 years old , except as specified. Additional information about the well drilling rigs are posted on TACOM's web site at http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/sources.htm  under the Open Notice and Surveys section.  The title is 'SLEP of LP 12s'  Click on 'Pictures of the rigs and copies of  the Technical Inspection Sheets' to view.  This information consists of Technical Inspection sheets and pictures of the well drill rigs. The contractors should provide the following information: 1.  What is the estimated cost to SLEP the rigs to 10/20 condition?  This should be just a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate and will be used by the Army for budgeting purposes only.  This ROM should include the cost of all replacement parts required  for the SLEP effort, which would be provided by the contractor. 2.  What is the estimated time required for the contractor to complete the modifications, starting with the contract award date.  This should include lead time needed for the contractor to procure all required replacement parts.  3.  Where is the facility that would perform the SLEP work? 4.  What type of warranty would  the contractor be willing to provide? 5.  Can the contractor operate the well drilling rig in order to verify that the equipment is in operating condition following the SLEP?    Any comments, recommendations or questions should be directed to Tera Sinclair at sinclait@tacom.army.mil, no phone calls please.

<DESC>SUBJECT: Potential Airborne Remote Sensing Data Sources Sought for Suborbital Research Programs   THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. This document is for information and planning purposes only and will allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement and to submit a capability statement. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract. The intent is to create a database of suitable systems that may be included in future NASA Research solicitations, and to identify commercial capabilities that duplicate those currently in use by this agency. NASA reserves the right to determine the suitability of such sensors, based on their ability to fulfill its research requirements. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review. It is not known at this time if a solicitation will result from this request for information (RFI). If a solicitation is issued, it will be posted on the NASA Ames Business Opportunities website. Capability Statements, System description and source qualifications should be submitted in electronic format to Audrey.A.Guerra@nasa.gov, by the response date specified above. In responding, reference RFI NNA04L059125.  NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) is hereby soliciting information from industry to identify commercial remote sensing instruments that may be of use to NASA in furthering its research objectives, and to determine how they may apply to the specific science focus areas in its Earth Science Enterprise (ESE.) The mission of the NASA Earth Science Enterprise is to understand and protect our home planet. Using the unique vantage points of both space and suborbital platforms (aircraft, UAVs, and others,) the NASA ESE collects global and regional measurements that assist in answering questions about how the earth functions as a system. The Suborbital Science Program is undergoing significant change in content and nature. Traditionally the NASA ESE has maintained a set of platforms and sensors as in-house assets, but in order to increase innovation in ESE’s suborbital-based research, the Suborbital Science Program is beginning a transition away from a small core of NASA assets towards a catalog approach of NASA, federal and commercial sources. For those capabilities, which have become operational or commercially available, non-NASA assets will be used while NASA concentrates its resources on introducing innovative suborbital platforms and investigating new sensor technologies. Because we are at the beginning of the transition period, procedures to establish, maintain and exploit the catalog of sources are not yet finalized.  It is the intent of the Earth Science Enterprise however to satisfy its requirements for remote sensing data through commercial data providers wherever it is both cost-effective and appropriate for the ongoing scientific investigations. NASA recognizes that not all commercial systems conform to the precise requirements and specifications for scientific measurement. Based on responses received from this RFI, some instruments may be invited to participate in an assessment exercise involving field and/or laboratory calibrations, designed to objectively determine their suitability for specific science missions.  Proprietary information (including information the contractor does not wish to share openly) should either not be included in the response, or should be conspicuously highlighted so it is not included in the summary the government intends to provide to field personnel. Respondents are encouraged to answer as many of the specific items as possible with their fullest disclosure.  In addition, this request will serve to inform the commercial remote sensing community as to how they can better serve the larger earth science community through research and development in new sensing technologies. Interested and qualified sources are requested to provide a statement of capability and past performance information. Sources must demonstrate management and technical experience on similar acquisitions specifically addressing the requirements specified in this synopsis and demonstrate the ability to successfully compete for this requirement. The following information should be provided:  1. General: company name, address, point of contact, web address, telephone and facsimile numbers, type and business size.  AGAIN, this synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  2. A description of the respondent's past experience in successfully performing this type of contract, including a description of the contract and name and phone number of the point of contact for the purchasing organization.  3. Instruments submitted for consideration: provide sensor description, make/model/manufacturer, brief description of technology, and specifications (spectral bands, bandwidths, FOV/IFOV, radiometric and geopositional accuracies, size and weight, etc.).  4. Operating Parameters: types of platforms used (note type restrictions, or if a dedicated platform is required). Altitude & airspeed operating envelopes, other limitations (e.g. cryogen durations).  5. Data Products: description of deliverable products, data formats, metadata data (e.g. platform navigation data, geo-location, etc.)  6. Calibration: brief description of calibration methods and frequency of measurements, data precision and accuracy (if known).  7. Experience: provide a brief description of uses and applications.  8. Sensor Requirements Matrix: The sensor matrix describes the airborne science measurements that the Earth Science Enterprise wants to conduct to further their research objectives. Please be aware that most of these science investigations require quantitative, traceable measurements; and as such, most data are required to be easily convertible to physical units, or to preferably be delivered as such. The intent is to learn which of the measurements described in the sensor matrix can be made by instruments currently in the commercial sector. (See attachment) Questions 1 through 7 is the vehicle for your company to explain exactly what the capabilities of your instrument are and how it has been used and calibrated. Please provide specific answers to these questions and in a standardized format, to make the resulting data easy to analyze and compare.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments or questions to: [Audrey Guerra at (650) 604-6474)], no later than April 15, 2004. When responding reference the RFI number.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  B. An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with any ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the installation ombudsman. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at the installation may be referred to the NASA ombudsman. Please do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the contracting officer or as specified elsewhere in this document.  The Ombudsmen for each of the NASA installations and for the agency and their phone numbers are available at the following URL:      http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/hq/library/Omb.html

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP).  The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection has a need for a lower cost version of handheld (portable) Land Mobile Radios (LMR).  BACKGROUND:  The Department of Homeland Security has several LMR networks that are national in extent and scope.  These networks operate in the VHF range of 162 to 174 MHz.  These systems function with repeaters mounted on towers, thus providing extended coverage within a particular geographic area.  Each radio can communicate with other users either by way of the nearest repeater or directly with other radios. The current LMR is similar in appearance and performance to many public safety handheld radios, and is approximately 6.5” X 2.5” X 1.5” with an 8.5” monopole antenna attached. The Government is seeking alternative solutions that can provide the following minimum sub-set of the performance capabilities of current LMR, but at a significantly lower cost.  The following parameters are needed:  (1) Frequency: 162 – 174 MHz, (2) a minimum of 4 Channels, (3) Current DES FIPS-140 certified encryption with potential for upgrade to AES capability by December 2004, (4) Current or potential for upgrade to OTAR capability by December 2004, (5) 5W transmit power, (6) 8 hour battery charge (80-10-10 duty cycle), (7) Commercial Ruggedized (not required to meet military specifications).  Any alternatives (regardless of dimension) that can meet the above capabilities and provide effective communications via a handheld device will be evaluated.  Internal functions such as processing methods, schemes, etc. will be left to the vendor’s discretion. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.  The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as the result of the submission of the contractor’s information.  The Government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Firms that wish to respond to this RFI shall provide a technical proposal/approach and an estimated cost to the Contracting Officer (Aaron Ford) via e-mail at Aaron.H.Ford@dhs.gov or at Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20229, (202) 344 – 1404.  The estimated cost is for budgetary/planning purposes.  Firms should also include their business size, CAGE code, Dun & Bradstreet number and GSA Schedule should they possess one.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection is seeking sources that are capable of providing for covert, low profile antennas.  Currently, Customs and Border Protection agents’ vehicles are easily identifiable as law enforcement vehicles due to the presence of the radio antennas.  Consequently, a need exists for disguised antennas making agents’ vehicles should be as unnoticeable as possible.  The disguised antenna schemes should provide the same performance level in the VHF range (162–174 MHz) as the existing antennas.  All designs and proposed strategies for accomplishing this goal will be reviewed/evaluated.  There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection is seeking sources that are capable of providing for a lower profile version of Land Mobile Radios (LMR).  Currently, The Department of Homeland Security has cognizance over several LMR networks that are national in extent and scope.  These operate in the VHF range of 162 to 174 MHz.  These systems function much like existing commercial cellular phone service with repeaters mounted on towers, thus providing coverage in a particular area.  Each radio can communicate with other users’ radios either by way of the nearest repeater or directly with other radios.  A need exists for a compact, smaller volume, more covert version of the existing LMRs in use. The current packaging completely reveals the users’ identity as law enforcement and allows for no stealth.  The LMR appear similar to state and local police radios and is approximately 6.5" X 2.5" X 1.5" with an 8.5" monopole antenna attached. The radios come in 2 variants: (1) mobile radios that are installed in automobiles and (2) handheld portable radios. Repackaged solutions that appear like a cell phone with approximately equivalent effective range performance are desired.  Any creative or innovative approaches to provide communications via handheld devices will be considered.  Internal functions such as processing methods, schemes, etc. will be left to the vendor’s discretion.  Emphasis will be placed on external appearance and equivalent functionality with the CBP existing radio equipment/infrastructure.  All designs and proposed strategies for accomplishing this will be reviewed/evaluated.  There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.  The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as the result of the submission of the contractor’s information.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer from any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Firms who wish to respond to this RFI shall provide a technical proposal/approach and a cost estimate to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at Aaron.H.Ford@dhs.gov.  The cost estimate is for budgetary/planning purposes.  Firms who wish to respond to this RFI should also include their business size, CAGE Code, Dun and Bradstreet number, GSA Schedule, should they possess one.  Interested persons should contact Aaron H. Ford, Contracting Officer Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20229.

The IPS should have experience with a variety of sensors and Intrusion Detection Systems to include Netranger, Realsecure, NFR, Tivoli Cross-Site, Netprowler and other Scanning Tools.  The sophisticated abilities of Internet hacker activity will require at least the above knowledge.; b) 24x7 monitoring   a fully redundant operations center staffed with security experts dedicated to monitoring and reacting to security alarms; c) Incident Control and Recovery   provides the containment and eradication of a security breach, the restoration of normal system operation, and the investigation into the cause of the breach.  IPS will provide a solution to prevent this type of breach from occurring in the future; d) Investigation Services   A team of experts trained in investigating security incidents, gathering and analyzing evidence, and developing a report of investigation; 7) IPS should work closely with a variety of security organizations around the world, both within the government community and outside.  Two examples are:  a)Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)   A global organization established to foster cooperation and response coordination among computer security teams worldwide; b) Global Security Analysis laboratory (GSAL)   A team of scientists and researchers in the United States and Europe devoted to identifying computer and network vulnerabilities and creating solutions to overcome security risks.  In the response, vendors should identify the security organizations with which they associate on a regular basis.  Vendors having the capability to meet the above requirements are invited to submit complete details.  The responses must clearly state the ability to meet the above requirements.  Interested parties must respond to this notice within  15  calendar days from date of this publication.  Vendors should provide the names and contact information of customers.

<CONTACT>Richard Wheelwright, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3941
<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC EOD Directorate has a requirement to develop a laser target aiming and stand-off measurement device. The device shall be easily  mountable on all standard service disrupters (PAN, 0.50 CAL, J-ROD, RE-70, and  RE-1212) without special attachment and tools. The device must be able to give  an indication of the disrupter slug aim point on the target and the standoff  distance between the disrupter barrel and the target. The device shall be  designed for both manual operation (device mounted on stand alone disrupter and  operated manually) and remote robotic operation (device mounted on disrupter  which in turn is mounted on a Talon robot and remotely operated). For manual operation, a numeric indicator would give stand-off distance between  disrupter and target. A laser or other illuminated device would give the  disrupter slug impact point on the target. For robotic operation, the device must have a RS232 connection to send data  back to the robot operator control unit using robot existing communication  link. A read out or display of disrupter stand-off and aim point must be  visible through the robot cameras or displayed on the operator control unit. In addition, the device must conform to the following requirements: 1. Stand-off distance error less than 1 mm at a distance of 10 feet. 2. Compact and light weight 3. Corrosion resistant and weather-proofed. 4. Must be able to withstand repeated disrupter firings without failure. Interested contractors/manufacturers are requested to submit descriptive  design/product for evaluation to the government. This is a market survey. Development of this device will be accomplished  through a solicitation to be issued in due course. Respond to Donald Chin, AMSRD-AAR-AEX,  Picatinny, NJ., E-Mail:  echin@pica.army.mil.

Alternate A, (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code-means (1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or (2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an NCAGE code. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. Data Universal Numbering System +4 (Duns+4) number, means the Duns number assigned by (D&B) plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see Subpart 32.11 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database, means that-(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the Duns +4 number, into the CCR database; (2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the CCR database; and (3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the records-Active. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation, (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS+4, followed by the DUNS or DUNS+4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number-(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnd.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. (iv)Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from Physical). (v) Company Telephone Number. (vi)Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<CONTACT>Kelly Rima, Purchasing Agent, Phone 303-497-3779, Fax 303-497-3163, Email Kelly.Rima@noaa.gov
<DESC>The Materials Reliability Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for double vacuum melted (VIM/VAR) 18 Ni maraging steel bars, to be used to produce precisely machined, heat treated Charpy V-notch specimens. These specimens shall be sold by NIST as standard reference materials to certify the calibration of Charpy V-notch machines, so the specimens (and the steel) must be of the highest quality possible. The American Society for Testing and Materials specification E23 describes this test and these specimens. The steel shall be of a single heat and the ingot(s) shall be adequately forged prior to rolling to minimize compositional and microstructural variation in the final products. Because steel plants produce steel in different heat sizes (inherent to their facilities) we have tried to add some flexibility to this contract by bracketing the quantity of the steel to be purchased: 4,000 to 5,000 pounds.  
Compositional Requirements: The steel shall be produced using a double vacuum melting procedure (vacuum induction melt-vacuum arc remelt). The steel shall meet the following nominal compositional requirements:
Ni=18.5
Mo=3.0
Ti=0.7
Al=0.1
Si=0.1 max
Mn=0.1 max
C=0.01 max
Sulfur=0.01 max
Co=0.5 max
P=0.01max
The composition shall be certified using standard analysis procedures (such as optical emission spectroscopy or x-ray fluorescence), and the equipment shall be calibrated by standards traceable to NIST. The composition shall be measured at the top and bottom of the vacuum arc remelted ingot before it is processed. These two measurements shall be included in the documentation with the order, and shall meet the compositional requirements given above within reasonable tolerances for 18 Ni maraging steel. Deviations between the two measurements (in wt. % between the top and bottom of VAR ingot) shall not exceed those expected for high quality VIM/VAR 18 Ni ingots (by current steel making standards).
Product Form: The heat shall be processed to 0.50 inch (+0.10, -0.00) square bar. The corner radius of the finished bars shall not exceed 0.03 inches. The maximum average grain size shall be ASTM number 10. In other attributes (surface condition, etc) the steel shall be suitable for use as 0.394 inch square Charpy V-notch specimens. The bar can be delivered in the as-rolled condition. The bar shall be machine straightened (for twist and bow) and shipped in lengths no less than 6 ft and not more the 12 ft. (11 to 12 ft. lengths are ideal). 
Packaging: The bar shall be packaged in bundles identified with reference to which portion of the ingot (or ingots) it was processed from. If possible, we would like the bundles to consist of bar rolled from individual billets or feed stock used for the rolling operation. The bundles shall weigh less than 4,000 pounds, which is the capacity of our fork truck. We consider 1000 lb. bundles to be an ideal size. This material shall be stored outside at the Boulder, Colorado facility for up to a year. The packaging shall be suitable for this type of storage without degradation of the box or markings. Since the surfaces will be ground, a small amount of surface rust can be tolerated.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K) as a combined notice/solicitation.  No separate solicitation is available. This procurement is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. FAR Clauses in full text are available at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/. Any contractors doing business with the Government must now be registered with the Central Contractor Registry. The web site is http://www.ccr.gov/. Agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/reflib/alp1296.htm. Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.

8. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below 
I.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

The Narcotics Affairs Section in Port Au Prince Police Liaison Officer (PLO) will work collectively with INL Washington, the Haitian National Police (HNP), the OAS Special Mission (SM) in Haiti and the UN to develop, implement, and initially advise the HNP and the Ministry of Interior on matters related to standing up a successful criminal justice system in Haiti, and to coordinate U.S. foreign policy initiatives regarding the successful training, equipping and continued development of the HNP.  The PLO frequently meets with members of the international community, including police and non-police assigned to the Multinational Interim Force (MIF), OAS SM, UN Mission, and various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for the purpose of gathering and disseminating information pertinent to HNP development, integration into a possible future CIVPOL mission and the overall international effort directed at Haitian law enforcement development.  The PLO is frequently required to attend emergency action committee and law enforcement working group meetings at the Embassy and render opinions of overall police project progress based on sources such as reporting by relevant U.S. advisors, MIF commanders, and OAS and HNP police authorities.  The PLO will be in charge of the US law enforcement development team in Haiti.

Background

INL and the Bureau for Western Hemisphere Affairs plan to send a total of up to 6 police advisors to work with the HNP and SM to advise, set up the police academy, work within the Ministry of the Interior, and work with the HNP Director General to start vetting, develop a strategic plan and management structures, and set up a command and control structure.  The coordination of a complex program of this scope and importance to U.S. foreign policy goals requires a full-time person with significant police expertise to monitor and troubleshoot the day-to-day aspects of the police and administration of justice program.  This PLO will have the responsibility to coordinate the work of up to 6 other police advisors in Haiti working with various elements of the police and justice institutions.

Level of Effort

--  The position is full-time, with a minimum of 40 hours per week.       
--  The PLO will report to the INL program manager in Washington and the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) at the Embassy in Port-au-Prince.
--	Frequent travel to all areas of Haiti is required.  Infrequent travel within the geographical region and internationally may also be required.

Position Elements

-- Provide expert police advice to the MOI and DG of police regarding the establishment of a functioning, accountable police force.

-- Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the HNP in Haiti, with special emphasis on HNP development, and any U.S. CIVPOL activities and the unique policy matters related to law enforcement development and U.S. CIVPOL.

-- Coordinate activities of U.S. police advisors assigned to the Haitian Police Academy, prison system, Ministry of the Interior, and HNP Director General¡¦s office. 

--Liaise with the MIF and Police Officers assigned to the OAS Special Mission and their contract program managers to ensure that acceptable OAS and U.S. standards of police assistance and performance are being met throughout the project.

The government intends to solicit and negotiate on an other than full and open competitive basis with a small business distributor of Hoffman Cabinets, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The Hoffman datacom/networking cabinets are to be modified to conform to specific environmental requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.

The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on a sole source basis based upon responses received.   The Government will not pay for any information received.

<DESC>Amendment 0002:  The due date for this combination solicitation/synopsis hs been extended from 3:00 PM EST April 5, 2004 to Thursday, April 8, 2004 at 3:00 PM EST.  This synopsis/solicitation is for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.603, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement requests a detailed capabilities statement (technical quote) in addition to a price quote and constitutes the only solicitation; a paper solicitation will not be issued. Request for Quotation number SECHQ1-04-Q-0028 shall be referenced on any capabilities statement (technical quote) and price quote.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC-20 for full and open competition (this competition is unrestricted). All future information about this acquisition including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This contract action may result in multiple awards, or one single award.  Contracts shall be Firm Fixed Price commercial item Purchase Orders, and may be awarded as a Base Year plus 4 option years.  The Government's requirement is for the following commercially available services:  C.1  Background  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is creating and staffing a new Office of Risk Assessment.  One responsibility of this office is providing means and mechanisms for early and focused identification of companies engaged in fraudulent, illegal or inappropriate (including misleading, opaque, or incomplete) financial reporting.  A companion interest in this objective will be to use risk assessment services or products to identify anomalies in disclosure or financial reporting by public companies subject to the SEC’s disclosure program.  For this purpose, the SEC is seeking computer-based products, services, or software.  Offerors are requested to provide a detailed Capabilities Statement for a commercial product capable of achieving some or all of these objectives. C.2 Scope Commercial products shall be used to identify companies requiring additional inquiry and investigation.  These products shall assist the SEC in identifying changes in financial position or operational results in financial statement presentations not evident in a routine reading of disclosure that may represent material deficiencies in the documents filed by public companies.  C.2.1  The initial focus of this analysis will initially be Forms 10-K (annual reports), 10-Q (quarterly reports), and possibly Form 20-F (foreign private issuers).  C.2.2  Offerors’ commercial products shall provide features such as historic coverage of data related to accounting and audit reports for publicly traded companies.  The commercial products shall have analytical capabilities that signal risk factors.  These tools may provide pre-selected criteria for risk analysis and/or allow for customized measures.  C.3  Objectives  Offerors shall provide commercial products having a flexible user interface and/or reporting capability.  An important performance objective is a high ratio of positive signals (problem companies or reports) to false signals (indications of problems that turn out to be incorrect).  More details in databases and computational platforms are provided in the next section.  C.3.1  Desired characteristics of commercial risk assessment products include the following kinds of evaluations and/or comparisons:  1)Evaluation of a company’s present and past financial data  2)Evaluation of a company’s financial ratios against parameters that may suggest inappropriate financial reporting exists  3)Evaluation of other performance measures that may suggest misleading, opaque or incomplete financial reporting  4)Comparison of a company with peers in an industry group  5)Comparison of a company’s risk evaluation with audit opinions  6)Comparison of a company’s accounting reports with other publicly available SEC information (e.g. litigation releases, accounting and auditing releases, EDGAR filings)  C.3.2  Offerors should address the extent to which financial statements conform to accounting standards, generally accepted industry practices, and the requirements of the federal securities laws and regulations.  C.4  Background and Current Environment  It is anticipated that specific risk assessment requirements and resulting objectives will evolve over time.  Consequently, the commercial products will also evolve in sophistication and complexity over time, especially at a point where there are data content tags for the reports filed with the Commission.  C.4.1 The commercial products shall initially provide for interoperability with respect to the SEC’s enterprise architecture.  The SEC’s current development environment includes 1) reporting tools such as Business Objects, Actuate, Crystal, and Brio; 2) databases such as Sybase ASE and Sybase IQ; 3) the Microsoft suite of tools (Access, Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Project, Visio); 4) development languages such as C, TCL, Java, J2EE, HTML, UML, XML, XSLT, JSP, Struts, and Servlets (used with TomCat as the JSP server for web development); 5) PureEdge to display internet forms; 6) web services technologies such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI; 7) Project Version Control System (PVCS) Tracker and PVCS Version Manager for configuration management of automated information systems; 8) Test Director for independent testing; 9) the search engine Autonomy; and 10) firewall and intrusion detection software.  The SEC’s current Technical Infrastructure standards include  A.  Application Servers such as Enterprise Systems:  Sun (Enterprise Servers 4000 series, 4500 series, V880 series, 280 series, E450 series)  Operating Environment:  Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u  Departmental Systems:  Sun (Ultra Sparc series, V120 series, 280 series) Operating Environment:  Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u   Workgroup Systems:  Compaq (File Servers - Proliant ML530, Other Compaq Special purpose servers).  (Migration):  Dell PowerEdge 2550/6450 (Dual Pentium III Processors)  Operating Environment: Microsoft NT Server 4.0  (Migration):  Microsoft Windows 2000 Server (Active Directory)  B.  Web Servers such as  Dell (Various Models), Sun (Enterprise Servers), Dell PowerEdge  Operating Environment:  Windows 2000, Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u  Software:  Netscape Suitespot 3.x, Apache, Microsoft IIS, Tomcat  C.  File Servers such as  Systems:  Dell 1650/2550/2650/6450/6650 (Dual Pentium III Processors)  (Migration):  Compliant Proliant ML360/560/580  Operating Environment: Microsoft NTS 4.0 Server/2000 (Migration):  Microsoft Windows 2003  C.4.2  Vendors shall be required to ensure confidentiality with respect to SEC queries of risk assessment services and the nature of the information derived from such queries and services.  Vendors shall ensure that no details of SEC usage are disclosed to the public, including possibly a prohibition against their disclosing that the SEC is a user of their product, service, or software.  Period of performance shall be for the period of 12 months.  Award is anticipated in May 2004.  The Government intends to issue one or more commercial item purchase orders for the above items to the responsible vendor whose Capabilities Statement /quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors which are in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate quotes: (1) technical acceptability (i.e., reliability and effectiveness of the product being proposed and its compatibility and interoperability with the SEC’s enterprise architecture),  (2) user training, (3) past performance for requirements that are similar to the SEC’s Statement of Objectives (offerors shall provide complete client contact information so that reference checks may be conducted), and (4)price.    If options are awarded, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price of all options to the total price of the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  This evaluation will be based on information provided by the contractor.  The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the Capabilities Statement or quotation, but may do so at its discretion. Only authorized representatives shall submit quotes. Please carefully review the commercial item clauses for information about requirements and instructions for submitting a quotation. Capabilities Statements that do not include prices for all items will not be considered. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.212.1, Instructions to Offeror- Commercial Items (OCT 2000); FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) - Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer is considered to be most advantageous to the Government, considering technical acceptability, user training, past performance, and price.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions, therefore, it is critical that each quote be fully responsive.  However, the SEC also reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined to be necessary, with offerors making the competitive range (i.e., the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for the purposes of efficiency).  Only those offerors determined to be within the competitive range will be invited to present a demonstration of their product to the SEC and will be asked to provide 30 day access to their commercial item product, free of charge, for evaluation purposes.  FAR provision 52-212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) - all offerors shall include a completed copy of this provision with their quote; FAR clause 52-212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items (FEB 2002); FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (APR 2003) - in paragraph (b) the following clauses apply; 52.203-6 Alternate I, 52.222-3, 52.222-19,52.222.21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37,52.232-33,52.232-36, 52.239-1, 52.222-41,52.222-43, 52.222-44. 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) also applies.  Clauses incorporated by reference may be accessed in full text at www.arnet.gov. All Capabilities Statements (technical quotes)and price quotes from responsible sources will be considered. Questions may be submitted on or before 2:00 PM EST April 1, 2004.  The price quote shall be submitted as a completely separate document from the Capabilities Statement (technical quote).  Two (2) copies of each Capabilities Statement (technical quote) and two (2) copies of each price quote shall be submitted to Debra E. Chapman, clearly marked RFQ no. SECHQ1-04-Q-0028 either via hand delivery or U.S. Mail to Securities and Exchange Commission, MS-020, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria VA 22312, or to chapmand@sec.gov, or faxed to (703) 914-9226 no later than 12:00 Noon EST, April 5, 2004.

6 Project Descriptions and Profile

The Definitional Mission will investigate potential telecom projects in Kosovo recommended and identified by USTDA.  The principal projects to be reviewed include business planning assistance to the Post and Telecom of Kosovo (PTK) and possible assistance to a local Internet service provider.  

The Post and Telecom Enterprise of Kosovo (PTK) was established by the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in 1999.  This was done in order to provide basic telephone services to the population of Kosovo.  At the end of 1999, UNMIK (via PTK) signed a contract with Monaco Telecom, establishing a mobile service that provides coverage throughout most of the Kosovo territory.  At the beginning of 2002, PTK began providing Internet access services as well.  

Though ostensibly profitable, the company is not properly organized and managed in a manner that is consistent with the Kosovo company law. The company does not maintain a proper balance sheet, and there is significant cross-subsidization among its various business units. With intent to privatize in the long-term and more effective management in the short term, PTK is taking measures now to introduce commercially-oriented reforms. 

One result of PTK’s poor management is that the company has accumulated significant cash reserves, which it has not been able to invest. These reserves, which are reported to amount to tens of millions of dollars, could be invested in new infrastructure that would both serve the citizens of Kosovo and create opportunities for U.S. suppliers. 

It is envisioned that the DM would likely recommend projects related to commercialization activities, including the development of a corporate business plan, investment strategy, or management and infrastructure plan.  

The DM consultant will be required to have expertise in the telecommunications sector, including knowledge of legal and regulatory issues, information technology, and development aspects of the telecommunications market.  It will also be important for the consultant to have a strong corporate background in order to recommend a business model appropriate to the economics of this DM.  

The DM consultant will travel to Kosovo to assess the telecom sector according to USTDA criteria, paying special attention to developmental impact and trade capacity building.  In addition to the proposed evaluation of PTK, the DM consultant will look for other potential USTDA opportunities.  If the projects warrant USTDA consideration, the consultant will write terms of reference and budgets for each recommendation.

Project Profile

Jordan is a main crossing point for major regional interconnection projects including EIJLLST, which aims to connect the electrical networks in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Syria and Turkey, as well as MEDRING, a Mediterranean-wide interconnection project.  Given the serious deficiency in the installed power capacity in Iraq, anticipated to extend into ongoing and future reconstruction efforts, the Iraqi Minister of Energy has requested an interconnection to Jordan’s electrical grid to supply much needed power.  In response to this request, Jordan NEPCO conducted a preliminary study to ascertain the best approach to establishing an electrical interconnection between the two countries.  The study found that the interconnection could be achieved in three stages:

o	Constructing a 400 kilovolt (kV) overhead transmission line from the Risha, Jordan substation to the Al-Qaim substation in Iraq; 

o	Constructing a 400/132 kV substation in Risha and upgrading the interconnection line between the countries to be operated on 400 kV; and

o	Reinforcing the 400 kV network in Jordan by connecting the Risha 400 kV substation with the Amman North 400 kV substation or the Al-Samra 400 kV substation, in order to synchronize the Jordanian and Iraqi networks after the year 2007.

NEPCO (which is supervised by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR)) is a Jordanian state-owned power company.  It is responsible for electrical energy planning, transmission, interconnection and power exchange with neighboring countries, and bulk sales either directly to bulk consumers or to distribution companies which supply electricity to individual consumers throughout the country.  NEPCO has provided USTDA a proposed scope of work and seeks USTDA support for a comprehensive feasibility study to investigate alternative schemes for the Jordan-Iraq interconnection.  NEPCO has also specified that such a study should take into account the required reinforcement of the national electrical grid and existing electrical interconnection lines with Egypt and Syria.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The definitional mission will evaluate two separate multi-modal port projects in Northwest Mexico.  The first project involves a request for a feasibility study on the proposed Tijuana Inter-modal Terminal (TIT), and the second a multi-modal transport system located at the border in Nogales, Sonora.

As the U.S., Canada and Mexico move into the 2nd decade of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), one of the most pressing concerns facing the three countries, in particular Mexico, is the strength and competitiveness of the trading block.  Mexico has recently suffered from lost manufacturing jobs to Asia and is searching for methods to regain its competitiveness (in 2003, Mexico lost approximately 250,000 manufacturing jobs to China).  One of the best solutions is for Mexico to capitalize on its geographical proximity to the U.S. – offering more secure and efficient trade networks to the U.S.  Mexican authorities are trying to address USG desires of creating a more secure trading environment, promoting physical and institutional infrastructure which will enhance the level of safety and security for all goods entering the U.S.

The preliminary estimate of the cost of implementing the Tijuana Inter-modal Terminal is $12 million.  While USTDA has not received an official proposal for the Nogales multi-modal transportation system, the project scope and implementation costs appear similar to those for the TIT.  Potential financing sources include both federal and state governments, Mexican development banks, and a list of private investors.  The projects are expected to generate export opportunities for U.S. suppliers of handling and electronic control equipment, logistical networks, and IT services.  The development of multi-modal terminals on the U.S./Mexican border will have a positive developmental impact, as they will promote the competitiveness of Mexico together with the NAFTA trading block.

This definitional mission will refine the Scope of Work and Terms of Reference presented by the City of Tijuana for the Tijuana Intermodal Terminal, and assist the Sinaloa investor group in defining the best SOW and TOR for reaching the needs of the region.  The DM will evaluate the probability of project implementation and make recommendations to USTDA for funding.

The DM consultant will work with USTDA to evaluate the technical, economic, and financial feasibility of the proposed projects, confirming that the projects meet USTDA criteria regarding U.S. export potential, foreign competition, U.S. labor, and environment.

·	Confirm the proposal’s projections of possible U.S. exports, and confirm, or indicate, potential sources of exports, especially in terms of possible procurements for transportation and logistical equipment and services.
·	Review the proposed terms of reference from the CT and determine if they are appropriate for the project, with an emphasis on evaluating the implementation financing plan.  In addition, the DM consultant shall investigate the financing options for implementing the short to long-term goals of the CT to determine possible participation by Ex-Im Bank.  The analysis will include an evaluation of CT’s political and financial power and abilities to successfully develop the project from a financial point of view.
·	Work with the Sinaloa investor group to determine an appropriate grantee, as well as develop an appropriate SOW, TOR and budget.
·	Work with the other key stakeholders for both projects to determine their interest and dedication to the proposed project.
·	Work with the CT officials to prepare a budget appropriate for the requested scope of work and terms of reference.
·	Address the host country development indicators and provide appropriate order of magnitude forecasts of potential benefits.  Even more importantly, the DM consultant will be tasked with including an assessment of the development objective in the Scope of Work of the feasibility studies: the results of which will be reported in the feasibility study final reports.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

Tijuana is a dynamic border city and together with San Diego, California, forms one of the busiest bi-national regions in the world.  However, unlike its neighbor to the north, the city of Tijuana is unable to provide appropriate water and waste services to its growing population.  This lack of water/waste infrastructure results in an inability to provide adequate sewerage treatment as well as efficient and low cost potable water.  Tijuana’s population of 2 million demands a modern and effective water and waste system to provide environmentally safe and healthy sources of municipal water.
 
In 2003, Tijuana embarked on a vision to reform its water and waste system infrastructure.  This master plan is focused on providing an integrated strategy of ensuring public health, quality of life, and environmental protection.  This master plan was financed through grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the North American Development Bank and is now in the stage of specific project development.  CESPT is seeking funding for feasibility studies to engage three pressing needs: 1) utilization of residual waste, 2) expansion and rehabilitation of the Rosarito treatment plant, and 3) development of the Popotla treatment plant. 

1. Residual Waste:  The objective of this project is to develop uses and a market for residual waste produced in the four major wastewater treatment plants in Tijuana.  This type of activity is commonly practiced in the U.S. and elsewhere, utilizing residual waste for fertilizers, organic and industrial farming, and the like.

2. Expansion and Rehabilitation of the Rosarito Treatment Plant: The objective of this project is to augment the current treatment capacity from 35 liters/second (lps) to 60 lps (1st stage) and eventually 120 lps (2nd stage).  In addition, this project would look at adopting new methods of waste treatment.

3. Development of the Popotla treatment plant: The objective of this project is to establish a new water and waste treatment plant to cover the growing treatment needs of the Popotla region.  In addition, this plant will focus on reducing untreated discharges into the Pacific Ocean.

This definitional mission will assist CESPT in developing an appropriate scope of work and terms of reference for each of these projects, as well as explore other related projects in the Tijuana region.  In addition, the DM will evaluate and prioritize the projects and recommend to USTDA a funding package for CESPT.

The DM consultant will work with USTDA to evaluate the technical, economic, and financial feasibility of the proposed project, confirming that the project meets USTDA criteria regarding U.S. export potential, foreign competition, U.S. labor, and environment.

·	Confirm the proposal’s projections of possible U.S. exports, and confirm, or indicate, potential sources of exports, especially in terms of possible procurements for water and waste treatment facility equipment and services.
·	Review the proposed terms of reference and determine if they are appropriate for the project, with an emphasis on evaluating the implementation financing plan.  In addition, the DM consultant shall investigate the financing options for implementing the short to long-term goals of CESPT to determine possible participation by Ex-Im Bank.  The analysis will include an evaluation of CESPT’s political and financial power and abilities to successfully develop the project from a financial point of view.
·	Work with the other key stakeholders (principally industry/manufacturing, agriculturalists, and City government officials) to determine their interest and dedication to the proposed project.  
·	Work with the CESPT officials to prepare a budget appropriate for the requested scope of work and terms of reference.
·	Address the host country development indicators and provide appropriate order of magnitude forecasts of potential benefits.  Even more importantly, the DM consultant will be tasked with including an assessment of the development objective in the Scope of Work of the feasibility study: the results of which will be reported in the feasibility study final report.

Questions and Answers

1)  Specs state "Description and minimum specification requirements are........." and further state "Length shall not exceed twenty feet."  This statement is contradictory in nature.  Kindly clarify this point and advise if you will only accept a 20-foot boat or, in the alternative, if you will accept a 24-foot boat.
ANSWER  We are looking for a 16 to 20 foot skiff with a 12-person payload that meets the specified requirements.

2)  A steering console is not indicated in your specifications.  We plan to include an aft steering console.  Is this acceptable?
ANSWER  Yes, as long as the 12-person payload is not comprised.

3)  Specs do not call for any safety equipment, i.e. life 
jackets, ring buoy, flares, first aid kit, fire extinguisher, etc.  Are safety items such as these to be included?
ANSWER  No.

4)  Regarding the speed requirement, is 25 knots required with a full load or light load?  Please comment on this point.
ANSWER  25 knot speed is required with a full load.

5)  Specs make no mention of seating, however, with passengers aboard, it would appear that seating will be desirable.  We propose to put in seat bench/storage boxes.  Is this acceptable?
ANSWER  By the nature of the boat’s planned use, it would be preferable to seat along the sides, leaving the center open.

6)  Specs do not mention whether the bow door should be manually or electrically operated.  Kindly advise which is required.     
ANSWER  Manual.

7)  Specs do not call for an outboard protection bar encircling the engine.  Kindly advise if this item is required.
ANSWER  An outboard protection bar is not required.

8)  For shipping purposes, the boat must be shipped on either a trailer or shipping cradle.  Kindly advise which is preferred.
ANSWER Shipping on a trailer is preferred.

9)  Regarding passenger capacity, would like you to reconfirm what the desired number of passengers is.  Please keep in mind that if you use 200 lbs. per person, 12 people will equal 2,400 lbs.  In addition to this weight, there is also the weight of the engine, fuel and gear that must be calculated and taken into consideration, especially in terms of boat performance, stability and freeboard.
ANSWER Our requirement is for a 12-person skiff.

10. We have a clarification regarding the  "Aluminum rigid hull" means Rigid Inflatable with air filled tube collar around the vessel. Or,  just an all welded hull with a bow door for going ashore on the beach etc.

ANSWER "Aluminum rigid hull" means an all welded ALUMINUM hull with a bow gate.
