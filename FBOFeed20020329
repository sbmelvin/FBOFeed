This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  NASA/GRC intends to procure the items from Modern Technology Corp. (MTC), Dayton, OH  45432.  The statutory basis for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The rationale for the selection of this statutory basis is that under an existing contract MTC created and exercised the current verification and validation test plans on CIAPP releases aswell as coded engine objects adhering to the CIAPP programming standards. Additionally MTC has developed expertise in the sensibility and probabilistic frameworks using CIAPP.  Changing to a new contractor at this time would cause the requiring office to miss  FY 2002 Level One milestones while the new contractor acquired the requisite background knowledge. This notice is being issued as a Request for Offer for the following statement of work.

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION: 
The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Space Vehicle Components Branch (VSSV), as part of the Space Vehicle Directorate (VS) at Kirtland AFB NM is interested in receiving proposals in lightweight mirror technology for space-deployable imaging telescopes.  The total program budget for these efforts is approximately $800K over 8 to 15 months. AFRL will make one award. This Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) will remain open 30 days after date of publication.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC) is encouraged until proposals are received. AFRL Evaluators may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the evaluation. 
The Government will provide a site visit on 10 April 2002.  Offerors should contact the Technical POC, Dr. R. Scott Erwin, (505) 846-9816, to make arrangements to participate in the site visit.
B. TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA: 
This technical effort is focused on the development of lightweight mirror systems technology for space-deployable imaging telescope applications. The contractor should consider innovative approaches for the design of stiff, lightweight, space-traceable mirrors that meet the performance requirements of visible imaging applications.   Development of prototype mirrors based on the proposed technology is desired.  AFRL is specifically interested in approaches that addresses the following goals (in order of importance):  ultra-lightweight, high-stiffness mirror structures (technology goals of < 15 kg/m2 areal density, which must factor in any required mechanisms and control electronics, and first natural frequency in test mounting configuration > 80 Hz), applicability to large apertures (technology goal of 0.6 meters diameter circular), ability to achieve desired radius of curvature in mirror structures (technology goal of 5 meters ?b .2% for spherical optics), ability to achieve stringent radius-of-curvature matching between segments (technology goal of < 40 microns differential ROC between 3 segments), ability to provide stringent mirror surface figure error (technology goal relative to a best fit reference sphere ?T ??/4 peak to valley and < ??/40 rms at 633 nm over central 95% clear aperture), visible-quality, space-qualifiable coatings (technology goal is reflectivity of R ?d 90% from 450 - 850 nm at normal incidence, with no visible pinholes or defects in surfaces when viewed without magnification over central 95% clear aperture, with durability performance equivalent or greater to that of standard aluminum coatings),  low surface roughness (technology goal ?T 20 angstroms rms over central 95% clear aperture), stringent mirror surface quality (technology goal better than 40-20 scratch ?V dig over central 95% clear aperture), low complexity approaches (i.e. non-actuated), low thermal gradient sensitivity mirror structures (i.e. low thermal expansion or high conductivity), and approaches that offer significant improvements in manufacturing time to current commercial mirror fabrication techniques.
Offerors must propose development, design, fabrication, and test three (3) prototype mirrors that address all of the above technology goals to be acceptable for award.  These mirrors must be compatible with a 3 point mechanical mounting interface, to be provided by AFRL, that will allow further test and evaluation by the Government.  Offerors should contact the Technical POC Dr. R. Scott Erwin, AFRL/VSSV, 505-846-9816, fax 505-846-7877, email: richard.erwin@kirtland.af.mil to obtain a description of the mounting interface and planned AFRL testing configuration.  
All measurement units presented to the Air Force should use the meter-kilogram-second (MKS) system.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for two (2) burst disk assemblies for use on the X-ray Spectrometer on the Astro-E2 spacecraft.  The units are used on a superfluid helium tank/dewar and are used to provide overpressurization protection of the vessel containing the cryogen or its vacuum enclosure. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Hydrodyne, Burbank, CA.  The authority for other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A).  The burst disk assemblies are the same for previously built items for the ASTRO-E spacecraft which was lost due to a launch vehicle failure.  These items were designed and manufactured by Hydrodyne for the first mission, therefore, no reoccuring engineering time and costs will be incurred thereby making it possible to meet budget and schedule. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 4/8/02.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer (RFO) for the Test Control Center (TCC) on Stennis Space Center Mississippi. The work for this requirement consists of, but is not limited to the following: Provide all labor, equipment, tools and materials to construct the E4 Test Control Center, prep building, solvent storage shed and parking lot.  This effort will include, but not limited to, site preparation, concrete foundation, building utilities, wall/roof panels, interior/exterior windows and doors, flooring, wall covering, mechanical and electrical equipment, parking lot and sodding/seeding. Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, and relevant experience) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government.  BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts).  However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.  Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so. The order of magnitude for this procurement is $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, and the effort shall be completed within (365) calendar days after receipt of the notice to proceed.  This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  As a result, all qualified responsible sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the agency. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 233310 and $28.5 million, respectively.  The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about April 19, 2002, with an anticipated bid closing date of on or about May 20, 2002. The firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the RFO.   An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  Specifications and Drawings will only be made available on CDROM. Requests for copies shall be made by email to the Bid Distribution Office: jason.edge@ssc.nasa.gov or you may fax your request to (228) 688-1141.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement [with the exception of the specifications and drawings] will be available over the Internet. These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or  URL, for the NASA/SSC Business Opportunities page is: http://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=64  Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). A CDROM containing the specifications and drawings may be obtained from the Bid Distribution office; however, the closing date for the hard copy received shall be the same as the solicitation, inclusive of any amendments, released on the Internet.

<SUBJECT>A--TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR A LONGITUDINAL COHORT STUDY -- ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH
<SOLNBR>PR-NC-02-10074
<CONTACT>FRANCES B. LEGG, Contract Specialist, Phone: 919-541-3567, E-Mail: legg.frances@epa.gov
<DESC>This publication serves as a Notice of Intent for the Environmental  Protection Agency to acquire contractor services to provide technical support to the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), Office of Research and Development (ORD) for a Longitudinal Cohort Study Concerning Environmental Factors in Children's Health.  The Environmental Protection Agency is interested in planning, developing, designing, implementing and conducting a longitudinal cohort study which would be a multi-phase project addressing environmental risks to children's health.  Air, drinking water, pesticide residuals and other environmental exposures will be evaluated for their potential association with adverse health effects.  In the first few years of this contract, pilot studies, including methods development and validation studies, will be conducted that will fill data gaps and build capacity to conduct a large cohort study.  Following appropriate pilot work, pregnant women and/or women planning pregnancies, and their husbands or partners, who reside in a defined area of Central North Carolina may be recruited for a large scale study.  Pregnant women and their husbands or partners will be screened, followed through pregnancy and birth, and the ensuing children's cohort will be followed for a variety of health outcomes.  Intensive follow-up is planned for children who are at increased risk for certain health outcomes such as  asthma.  We are also interested in following children who have exposure to environmental chemicals and physical agents, including pesticides (residential and agricultural).  Children in the cohort will be followed for multiple years after birth.  The objective of the contract shall be to provide the EPA with professional and  technical support for a longitudinal birth cohort designed to identify parental and child health-related endpoints associated with pesticides and other environmental exposures. This longitudinal study is composed of methods development, study design, pilot studies, core activities to recruit and maintain the cohort and related research activities which investigate specific hypotheses.  The scope of the work shall include all technical aspects of preparing for and conducting a longitudinal cohort study and culminate with the potential implementation of a full study for a defined geographic area, such as Central North Carolina.  The full scale study may include identifying and coordinating health care providers and health clinics in Central North Carolina with a potential focus on  Durham, Wake, and Johnston Counties as a population basis for the study.  Work shall include  procuring, managing, and analyzing human data, and the collection, preparation, shipping, and analyzing of human biologic specimens and environmental samples.  Options in the contract shall include long term maintenance and follow-up of the cohort.  Other aspects of the contract may cover the development of issue papers or background reviews, conducting professional workshops and convening expert panels to discuss pertinent environmental or health issues. The Government anticipates a cost plus fixed fee, level-of- effort type-contract with a 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods for a total contract performance of 60 months.  The base contract period and each option period will consist of 3,800 hours with an option for up to 12,250 additional hours per period for a maximum potential of 80,250 hours.  The anticipated contract effective date for this  procurement is 09/01/02.  This is a full and open procurement.  This is a new procurement and does not represent a follow on to an existing contract.  Large business offerors will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan; all inquires regarding subcontracting opportunities shall be directed to Jerry Dodson, EPA Small Business Specialist at 919-541-2249 or email dodson.jerry@epa.gov.  The applicable NAICS is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees. The anticipated release date of the Request for Proposals (RFP) is on or about April 15, 2002.  The EPA anticipates a preproposal conference to be held in Chapel Hill, NC, 7-10 days after release of the RFP.  Proposals will be due approximately 30 days later. The RFP and any subsequent amendments will be available ONLY via the Internet World Wide Web at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  No telephone or facsimile requests will be honored.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Developmental Neural Plasticity Unit (DNP) plans to procure an Mira 900F Ti:S infrared (two-photon) laser with a 10-watt Verdi pump (Mira/Verdi system) from Coherent Laser Group, 5100 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95054.  The DNP is currently engaged in the study of fundamental mechanisms that underlie the development and remodeling of neuronal circuits in the mammalian olfactory system.  These studies use expressed fluorescent proteins (GFP, YFP, CFP, dsRed) in the olfactory system and will focus on imaging primary afferents as they converge and form synapses onto the olfactory bulbs.  This imaging system will be used to determine the precise organization of the circuitry that surrounds olfactory bulb glomeruli and by simultaneously imaging pre- and postsynaptic components to specific glomerulus detect any remodeling of that circuitry.  This will be accomplished by fluorescent labeling of individual olfactory cell types with different fluorophores that will then be distinguished in vivo (using a Zeiss 510 META scan head that will be combined with this laser system) and followed through glomerular development.  To detect the full spectral range of fluorophores that will be used for these experiments and to access neural cell types throughout the layers of the olfactory bulbs (500 um thick) it is necessary to use a high power 2-photon laser system with wide tuning range.  The tunibility (700nm and 1000nm) is essential for the wide variety of in vivo fluorescent markers that must be detected using this system which include the molecularly encodable GFP variants (CFP, GFP, YEP), dsRed as well as fluorescent tracers such as dextran-Rhodamine.  The infrared laser is required to induce two-photon excitation of fluorophores in living brain tissue.  Two-photon microscopy uses infared light that has half the energy required to elicit fluorescence: excitation only occurs where the beam is intense enough that two photons strike the same fluorophore molecule at the same time.  To elicit sufficient fluorescence deep into living tissue, a high-power (10W) laser source is required; to reduce phototoxicity, that power is confined to intense, ultrafast (100 MHz) pulses of light (each pulse is <100 fs in duration). This system is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  Coherent Laser Group is the only organization known to the NINDS researcher that has all the aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NINDS research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EST, on April 5, 2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendors responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.   NAICS 334516

<SUBJECT>99--11 MONTH EXTENSION OF RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AND LOGISTICS SERVICES
<SOLNBR>9-BG-79-2-70P
<RESPDATE>051302
<ARCHDATE>03292003

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an 11 Month Extension to the NASA Contract NAS9-19549 for Russian Language and Logistics Servcies (RLLS). The contractor will continue to provide services for an additional eleven months from February 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003.  The services provided by TTI include interpreting, translation, language training, Russian Segment Support, and Logistics.    Interpretation services include interpreting the Russian spoken language for English speaking individuals and interpreting English for Russian speaking individuals.  Interpretation services are used during face-to-face meetings, telecons, from Houston Mission Control Center (MCC) to the International Space Station (ISS), and from the Russian TsUP to the ISS.  The last two items combined require 24 hours a day, 7 days a week services.      Translation services include translation of documents of which many are extremely complex engineering and medical documents.  From time to time, schematics are translated from Russian to English. The contractor provides language training for English speaking individuals expected to travel to Russia on a short term or long term basis.  Intensive courses are provided to astronauts who will live and train in Russia for future missions.   The contractor also provides transportation services in Russia and in the U.S.  The program has determined that it is both safer for travelers and more cost effective to provide transportation for all U.S. travelers in Russia and all Russian travelers in the U. S.  Typically travelers are not familiar enough with Russian laws and driving customs to be safe drivers in Russia.  Economically, based on the expected number of travelers per year, it is cheaper for the Government to provide vans and drivers for travelers.  Also, logistics  provides labor for scheduling.  Every meeting requiring an interpreter and every document requiring translation is processed through the contractor's scheduling department.  Scheduling is essential to ensuring that the interpreter's are properly matched to meetings that may require a particular expertise.  In addition, documents requiring immediate turnarounds must be scheduled around existing efforts.                A fairly large percentage of the contract is a fixed price subcontract with a Russian formed company Space Flight Computer Support Center.  The subcontract provides Russian engineers from the TsUP to man flight consoles and support training and simulations to support Russian Segment hardware on orbit.  The Russian subcontractors are brought to Houston on three month rotation periods.  Any contractor providing these highly specialized services in Russia must be legally registered to do business in Russia.   NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from TechTrans International, Inc.  The authority cited permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1); Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.     The Government does not believe that competing this effort at this time is to its advantage.  Any cost savings achieved through competition would be diminished and overshadowed by costs and time delays needed to build relationships with both the ISS Program Office and the Russian partners including building an infrastructure within the Russian community.   However, NASA does intend to compete this effort in the near future.  The RLLS effort will be combined and competed as part of the ISS Mission Integration effort resulting in a contract to be awarded by 12/31/03.  To that end, NASA has issued a Request for Information Synopsis (9-BG-12-2-69P) which idicates the ISS Program's Contract Consolidation Strategy.  This synopsis discusses the strategy developed to consolidate contracts and offer competition opportunities to those interested.  To obtain a copy of the strategy, please view website    http://jsc-web-pub.jsc.nasa.gov/bd01/excellent-strategy/    The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. See note 22.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 13, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<CONTACT>Katherine Kearney, 7578785703
<DESC>NA The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of 6.2 Research & Development as described below.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  This Re search Announcement (RA) constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no formal Request For Proposals (RFPs), other solicitation requests, or other information regarding these requirements.  INTRODUCTION: An advanced engine is needed in the 500 shaft  horsepower class to support future UAV/Objective Force Systems (i.e., A160, Future Combat System). The Army anticipates developing a 500 shaft horsepower class engine under the DoD/NASA/DOE Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) initiative. The 500 horsepower class demonstrator engine program, entitled 'Small Heavy Fuel Engine,' is anticipated for award in the FY04 timeframe.  It is anticipated that this will involve of a new centerline engine with a 20% reduction in Specific Fuel Consumption  (SFC), a 50 % improvement in Shaft Horsepower to Weight (shp/wt), and a 35% reduction in production.  Key component areas that require early 6.2 development in support of this demonstrator are the compressor and turbine. Thus, the intent of this BAA is to  develop critical compressor and turbine technologies required for the Small Heavy Fuel Engine.  The offeror must substantiate how the proposed technology efforts are critical to their planned Small Heavy Fuel Engine configuration.   TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Technical Description:  The purpose of the Advanced Compressor and Turbine Programs are to develop and demonstrate compressor and  turbine technologies considered critical to the aforementioned Small Heavy Fuel Engine Program.  More specifically the technology must support an engine configuration that can achieve approximately: *0.45 specific fuel consumption (based on an assumed 500 SHP engine) *4.0 Horsepower to Weight ratio (without gearbox) *$120k per engine production cost (including basic HMU or FADEC control system) The Army does not have a definite application and production rate planned for this class of engine.  However, for the purposes of this solicitation, a referee assumed production rate of 1,000 engines over a 7 year period for Army UAV application should be used.   Similarly, a referee design life of 5,000 hours should be utilized.  The engine should be designed for minimal Operation & Support (O&S) cost.  The offeror should provide discussion of the O&S benefits of their selected engine configuration and sub sequent compressor or turbine technologies. The relative weighting of each of the above engine level goals is an equal weighting between specific fuel consumption and production cost with these being weighted slightly higher than horsepower to weight.  A separate proposal shall be prepared for each component area, compressor or turbine.  The offeror shall define the anticipated compressor or turbine configuration and performance characteristics consistent with their Small Heavy Fuel Engine design.  The offeror shall then substantiate how the selected  technologies to be validated in their proposed efforts will roll-up to the performance characteristics of their engine configuration.  The offeror shall design, fabricate and perform validation testing of those compressor or turbine technologies considere d critical to the offerors envisioned Small Heavy Fuel Engine goal achievement.  Validation testing shall be conducted in an environment that simulates engine operational conditions and shall be performed to validate aerodynamic, thermal, and/or mechanica l performance.  Upon completion of technical effort, a final briefing shall be conducted at Fort Eustis, VA.  ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  Anticipated period of performance is 43 months total with 40 months for the technical effort an d an additional 3 months for completion of the final report. Government Estimate: Compressor Total Program = $2.4 million   Government Share = $1.218 million Funding Profile: FY02- 15 %, FY03- 30 %, FY04- 30 %, FY05- 25 %. Turbine Total Program = $1.85 million. Government Share = $ 0.936 million Funding Profile: FY02- 5 %, FY03- 25 %, FY 04- 25 %, FY05- 35 %, FY06- 10 %.  Proposals must follow the guidelines described in this solicitation.  TYPE OF CONTRACT:  The Government contemplates award of a Technology Investment Agreement with 50  50 cost share.  DELIVERABLES: (1)  Letter Progress Report:  Submit in recipients format a quarterly letter progress report.  The first report shall be submitted 90 days after Agreement initiation and quarterly thereafter.  The report shall contain technical progress during reporting period and identify an y problems, technical issues or concerns that may have developed during the reporting period.  The report shall also contain cost incurred under the Agreement during the reporting period.  This cost shall identify both recipients cost and Government cost.   (2) Test Plan: The Recipient shall submit a test plan. The test plan shall be submitted 30 calendar days prior to the initiation of the validation testing.   This plan explains the philosophy, test logic, test sequence, test schedules and test procedures  to be utilized to obtain a successful demonstration of the technology.  The test plan shall include but not be limited to a discussion of test philosophy and the method of test, schedules of performance, procedures for checkout, acceptance limits for perf ormance capabilities, requirements and characteristics, and a description of the test equipment and instrumentation (type and location) to be used.  (3)  Final Report:  Submit three copies of draft final report, in recipients format, within 45 days of com pletion of technical effort under this Agreement.  Approval or recommended changes in one annotated copy will be returned within 30 days to the Recipient.

The report shall contain a detailed description of all technical effort performed under this Agreement and results to include conclusions drawn and recommendations.  (4)  Final Briefing @ Ft. Eustis, VA.  EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD:  The se lection of one or more sources for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section.  Proposals will be eval uated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  These evaluations will result in narrative ratings, which will be used to develop an order of merit listing for proposals submitted under this announcement.  Pro posed cost will be evaluated as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness.  The evaluation criteria are:  (1)  The extent to which the proposed work satisfies the Armys research need by use of innovative, creative, efficient, and affordable approaches t o the technical objectives.

Due to the highly technical nature of the research of the Surveillance Research Program(SRP),  coupled with the geographic distances and organizational heterogeneity complex communication issues arise. A centralized web-based collaborative application (known as the CISNET Collaborative Knowledge Database) is utilized.   This web-based tool allows participants to share knowledge within and between organizations in a persistent manner compatible with existing hardware and software installed at each site.  A model profiler, i.e. a framework of template documents for model description, was developed and software to support it was put into production and tested by sub-set of the CISNET members.  This project representation a novel interface between simulation modeling discourse and informatics.   Special tools and expertise are needed which include knowledge of systematic building and integration of stochastic simulation models for population based trends in cancer screening and incidence, as well as emerging Internet technologies and the associated skills and abilities to develop and support an interactive internet system for comparing simulation model structures and designs.  The current system is implemented as an ISAPI extension running under Windows 2000 Advanced Server, built with MS Visual Studio tools.  Cornerstone Systems, Northwest Inc., is uniquely qualified to perform due to their previous participation on the CISNET program since conception in year 2000.  Cornerstone Systems  as developed a prototype system for CISNET and has worked extensively with models of prostate, breast and cervical cancer with research in a joint effort between the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the NCI Cancer Surveillance Research Program involving the systematic building and integration of stochastic simulation models for population based trends in cancer screening and incidence.    This work requires an intimate knowledge of a number of separate simulation programs as well as extensive research in the general field of population modeling.  This experience and knowledge gives Cornerstone Systems the perspective to document and compare key aspects of models developed by researchers participating in the CISNET cooperative agreement, as well as a broad perspective of developing and programming a wide array of models.  Cornerstone Systems Northwest Inc. is the only known source to NCI researchers that has significant experience and expertise that is essential for continuity of this requirement.  A fixed price contract is anticipated with a period of performance of 1 year.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, including specific knowledge and expertise, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:00 PM EDT(local Washington, D.C. time) on April 15, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  If you have any questions please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  NAICS Code 541512.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division intends to purchase the following item on a Sole Source Basis from the manufacturer, TSI Inc., 500 Cardigan Road, P.O. Box 64394, St. Paul, MN 55164:  Automated Filter Tester, 115 VAC, (with universal filter holder for flat-sheet media), Model No. 3160 (1 Each).  The Automated Filter Tester supports the 6.2 research effort to develop toxic industrial chemically resistant particulate filter media.  The TSI CertiTest Model 3160 Automated Filter Tester (AFT) measures filter efficiency, as a function of particle size (fractional efficiency) in the size range of the filter's most penetrating particle size (MPPS).  A filter's MPPS is the particle size where a filter has its lowest efficiency (highest penetration).  Typical MPPS values are from 0.5 to 0.3 micrometers.  There are no other manufacturers of stand-alone automated filter te ster systems that measure filter efficiency as a function of particle size of air filters other than TSI Inc.  Other manufacturers of automated filter testing systems use photometers or optical particle counters.  Those systems either do not give any information about the particle size dependence on filter efficiency or do not go down to the size range where filters are the least efficient.  Delivery will be FOB Destination. If delivery is other than FOB Destination, then state delivery cost in offer.  Standard Commercial Warranty is Required.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Ocean Services, Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, Bryan, Texas, intends to contract for research specialist support services.  Background: The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) encompasses three separate topographic highs covering approximately 43 square nautical miles, approximately 107 miles south of the Texas/Louisiana border in the Gulf of Mexico.  Historically, the majority of scientific investigations have focused on the more accessible, shallower portions of the Sanctuary (within SCUBA diving range ? above about 130 feet).  This area represents less than 1% of the area encompassed by the Sanctuary boundaries.  Recent efforts using Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and submersibles have expanded our investigations into the deeper portions of the Sanctuary.  Many hours of data analysis including direct survey observations and post-processing are required to gain the full benefit of the submersible operations (including ROV).  Analysis includes identification and assessment of abundance of deep reef fish population, characterization of the benthic habitat, and identification of benthic components.  During the upcoming field season, the FGBNMS is planning at least three four-day dedicated ROV cruises to continue investigation of the deeper regions within the Sanctuary.  A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) initiative, Islands in the Stream, along with Dr. Sylvia Earle and a team form National Geographic's Sustainable Seas Expedition, will be joining together with Sanctuary personnel to explore these areas with Nuytco's Deep Worker 2000 and within the FGBNMS boundaries, but also several other topographic features on the continental shelf in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.   PAGIS (Protected Area Geographic Information System) is a joint initiative between the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), and the Coastal Services Center (CSC).  The development of this program provided for the integration of GIS into the National Marine Sanctuary program.  In 1998 CSC provided each Sanctuary with the hardware and software to implement GIS.  This position will allow FGBNMS to expand their capabilities utilizing this powerful science/management tool, and to integrate the data in systematic and useful components.  SCOPE OF WORK: During ROV and submersible activities, the contractor will be required to work on-site.  Some travel will be involved.  FGBNMS will provide the necessary monies to cover reimbursable travel.   Pre-approved equipment purchases will be reimbursed.  The following tasks will be completed by the Research Specialist: TASK 1: Participate on-site during Sanctuary sponsored ROV and submersible operations, as well as several SCUBA investigations on reef cap. Analyze tapes obtained from ROB and submersible investigations during Sanctuary operations as well as NOAA's Islands in the Stream initiative, in conjunction with National Geographic's Sustainable Seas Expedition.  Analysis to include fish identification and abundance, benthic habitat description, and benthic component identification.  ROV Operations: 12 days at sea, tape annotations ? up to six hours of tape per day, cruise summaries, integration of data into GIS.  Islands in the Stream: Up to 30 days at sea, tape annotations ? up to six hours of tape per day, cruise summary, integration of data into GIS.  TASK 2: Work with available data for pre-selected northwestern Gulf of Mexico topographic features to develop (GIS) bathymetric maps to use as a base to overlay submersible and ROV tracks during Islands in the Stream/Sustainable Seas Expedition 2002.  Integrate bathymetry into Winfrog tracking system.  REQUIREMENTS: The contractor must have a biological background, with experience in application or comparable class work of GIS.  He/she must have specialized skills and experience in deep reef habitat analysis, including thorough knowledge of Gulf ofMexico deep reef fishes and associated habitat, and trophic ecology.  He/she must have the ability to describe the above from videotape images.  He/she must be capable of self-direction after initial instruction on specific tasks, have computer skills (both Mac and PC preferred), experience in field work at a marine setting (therefore, SCUBA skills).  Additional skills in taxonomy, working knowledge of digital videotape editing, analysis, still frame capture, and benthic habitat assessment via photoquadrat analysis.  He/she must have experience with GIS (ArcView software, including Spatial and 3D Analyst) and ability to integrate bathymetric data into Winfrog tracking system.  Prior experience with oceanographic data collection and knowledge and experience with marine resources will greatly enhance productivity.  DELIVERABLES: Bi-weekly progress reports shall be submitted to the Sanctuary Manager and Research Coordinator for inclusion in the Sanctuary wide site reports.  Quick-look cruise reports after each cruise (contribute to Sanctuary research team effort).   GIS based CD showing ROV and submersible tracks overlaid on bathymetry and data analysis ? one CD per cruise.  At completion of contract, a single GIS based CD summarizing cruise data to date will be produced. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Anticipated award date (April 18, 2002) - December 31, 2002.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This notice is to amend the initial announcement on March 12, 2002 on combined Synopsis/Solicitation # F33DOL20560100. The following changes are to be made: (1) Change the Requirements by replacing it with the following: The application of this instrument is primarily to analyze metal alloy samples of varying sizes with elemental concentrations from 1 part per million to 100%. The instrument should be capable of direct analysis of solid samples, with minimal sample preparation, using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AA) coupled with a Glow Discharge (GD) type sampler/atomizer. The instrument must be capable of direct sample analysis of solids without acid digestion. The instrument should have a large sample compartment capable of accommodating samples of different sizes. Typical sample size may vary from 1 quarter inch in diameter to approximately 1 square foot. The instrument shall be capable of detecting and measuring 71 elements including carbon. Sodium, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, chromium and nickel are primary matrix interference elements and the instrument must be able to analyze and measure alloys containing high levels of these species. The AA/GD shall be a turnkey instrument capable of analyzing conductive and non-conductive solid samples of varying sizes. The GD sampler must not be of the Spark Ablation type since tungsten is a primary species of interest and since most spark ablation samplers contain tungsten electrodes.

<DESC>NA The USA Robert Morris Acquisition Center-Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, in support of the U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command, Natick Soldier Center is conducting a market investigation to identify alternate materials for the patien t wrap.  Design of the patient wrap will remain essentially the same as the current patient wrap with only minor modifications to update port areas and closures.  The program will leverage mature fabric technologies suitable for the three components of the  patient wrap system.  The Chemical Protective, Patient Wrap describes a chemical agent protective system to protect uncontaminated/decontaminated litter patients from chemical agent exposure during movement through a contaminated area from a treatment sta tion to more definitive care.  Three main material components make up the current patient wrap system.  The ground cloth is a three layer laminate described by MIL-C-44304 (Cloth, Coated:  Cloth, Laminated, Chemical Protective).    The top layer of materia l is a breathable laminate described by MIL-C-44303 (Cloth, Porous, Laminated System) and the window material is described by MIL-C-44305 (Plastic Film, Flexible, Polyamide and Polyethylene).   Material Qualification Requirements:  Each type of candidate material (ground cloth, window, or permeable top sheet) will be tested by the methods below and must pass the requirements in tables below.   All candidate materials must pass a skin toxicity ev aluation by the Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM).   GROUND SHEET:  Material must be totally impervious to moisture of any kind including liquid chemical agents and must meet the requirements in the table below.  For use in the patient wrap the color on both sides of the material will be required to approxim ate Camouflage Green 483 (color chip #34094 of FED-STD-595). To receive a package containing the appropriate material requirements for the Ground Sheet, please e-mail a request to: Rita.Devarakonda@natick.army.mil. PERMEABLE TOP LAYER:  A laminated fabric system is preferred for this layer of the patient wrap but fabric systems consisting of separate shell and liner will also be considered.  Upper surface material of wrap must be water repellent so that the protectiv e characteristics will not be degraded by exposure to moisture such as mist, rain, snow, or saltwater spray.  It is preferred that the shell of the fabric system shall conform to Class 2 of MIL-C-44031. Color shall be Woodland Camouflage pattern.  If submi tting a laminate whose upper surface material is not the Woodland camouflage 50/50 nylon/cotton twill fabric of MIL-C-44031, manufacturer must supply all information for the submitted fabric and a comparison of its properties to the nylon/cotton twill.  It  must be Woodland camouflage printed and be water and oil repellent.  This will also apply for the outer shell layer of a non-laminated fabric system.  The fabric system shall meet all the requirements in the table below. To receive a package containing the appropriate material requirements for the  Permeable Top Layer, please e-mail a request to: Rita.Devarakonda@natick.army.mil.   Spectral Reflectance Requirements   (Woodland Camouflage Pattern)* To receive a package containing the appropriate material requirements for the  Spectral Reflectance Requirements please e-mail a request to: Rita.Devarakonda@natick.army.mil. WINDOW MATERIAL:  Window material must be transparent to allow full visibility of patient. To receive a package containing the appropriate material requirements for the  Window Material, please e-mail a request to: Rita.Devarakonda@natick.army.mil. Interested sources must respond within 30 days of the date of this notice and shall include information detailed in Note 25 regarding a firm's experience, personnel, facilities and relevant company background/experience.  Product information should include  product cost, technical information (e.g.  technical literature, data and illustrations), performance capabilities, independent laboratory test results, and a small swatch of material for visual observation. Since all materials will be required to pass an evaluation for skin toxicity, Material Saf ety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all substances used in the manufacture of the materials should also be submitted.   Information on use of the submitted materials in similar applications would also be advantageous.  Sources should also indicate which material re quirement their product is expected to meet.  Firms responding shall indicate whether or not they are a small business and the appropriate North American Industry Classification (NAIC) Code for the company.  Any information/samples submitted will not be re turned.  If a firm chooses to submit samples, the Government will make no payment for those samples.   Responses to this notice are to be sent to:  Rita Devarakonda, U. S. Army Soldier Biological & Chemical Command, Natick Soldier Center, Chemical Technology Team,  Room D311, Kansas Street, Natick, MA  01760-5019.   E-mail:  Rita.Devarakonda@natick.army.mil .

<DESC>A&E services to develop a design that restores lower Beaver Creek and its floodplain to proper functioning conditions that allow the riparian area to move towards its potential natural community. Trout habitat conditions would be optimum when the riparian area reaches late seral or potential natural conditions.  The specific objective of the contract is to collect and analyze data from the existing impaired reach and two reference reaches from which to model a design that restores lower Beaver Creek.   Since, the Montana Power Company relies on a service road that intersects the impaired reach near its upper end, the design will also incorporate provisions for a new improved crossing.  Additionally, dispersed campsites adjacent the existing channel will be eliminated according to design needs for a restored channel.  Design will include construction drawings, plans and specifications sufficient to solicit bids from construction contractors for project implementation.  The design firm will perform construction oversight and guidance to ensure the desired outcome.  Estimated construction cost range is between $250,000-500,000. Qualified firms desiring consideration shall submit SF 255, including organizational chart of key personnel to be assigned to this project, current SF 254 and consultant's current SF 255s not later than the close of business (4 p.m.) on the due date.

<DESC>This modification changes only the total quantity of units being procured.                                                     

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Metalite Aviation Lighting on a sole source basis for an Expeditionary Airfield Lighting Cable Kit (CABKIT), which will be a means of distributing power to all edge lights installed at an Expeditionary Airfield, allowing continuous support of both runway and taxiway operations.  A maximum quantity of 58 CABKITS will be procured under an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity type contract.  The USMC Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Program provides airfield lighting support to a myriad of airfield scenarios, such as remote landing zones, minimum operating strips, bi-directional runways with or without taxiways, and emergency back-up to permanently installed systems.  Currently, the USMC is utilizing the Expeditionary Airfield Minimum Operating Strip Lighting System (MOSLS).  MOSLS is a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) system designed, manufactured and supplied by Metalite Aviation Lighting located in Birmingham, United Kingdom.  The two prime subsystems of MOSLS, the Minimum Operating Strip Lighting Kit (MOSKIT), Metalite PN S1N105017, and the Supplemental Airfield Lighting Kit, (SALKIT), Metalite PN S1N105016 both utilize the Omni-directional Runway Edge Light (OREL), Metalite PN S1N105168, as a core sub-element.  Each OREL is capable of operating from either its self-contained batteries or an external alternating current (AC) power source.  The CABKIT shall not contain its own power supply (e.g. generator), but shall be capable of distributing the proper AC power to the ORELs when connected to a variety of external power sources, to include the onboard MOSKIT generators.  The CABKIT must be completely compatible with the MOSKIT and SALKIT.  The Government does not own any engineering drawings or data rights for the MOSKIT, SALKIT, or their sub-components to include the OREL, and therefore cannot provide sufficient interface information to competitively procure the CABKIT.  Metalite Aviation Lighting, as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), is the only company capable of providing the CABKIT.  A single CABKIT system shall be capable of supporting 356 ORELs, and consist of the smallest quantity possible of similar packages, each configured within an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Quadruple Container (QUADCON) shipping container.  Any single CABKIT package must possess, at a minimum, all of the capabilities to support 36 ORELs, each located 500 feet apart.  The remaining support shall be for 320 ORELs spaced 250 feet apart.  Each individual CABKIT package shall be self-sufficient for the number of ORELs it is to support.  For example, if a CABKIT is to support 100 ORELs, it must contain at a minimum, 100 interconnecting cables, 100 mating connectors (if applicable), 100 junction boxes (as applicable) etc.  An additional 500 feet of cable shall be provided with each CABKIT system in order to connect the first light to the circuit.  Cable reels shall be stowed within the CABKIT containers with the capacity of being removed or stowed by no more than two Marines.  In addition, the CABKIT shall contain a minimum of one portable cable reel stand to aid in the deployment and recovery of cables.  The CABKIT will be inspected and accepted at Source, and shipped F.O.B. origin (shipping arranged by the Government) to  Lakehurst, NJ.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals no later than 10 April 2002. Responses should reference N68335-02-R-3047.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<DESC>SUICIDE INTERVENTION AND TRAINING CERTIFICATION:  The government intends to negotiate a non-competitive, sole-source, commercial purchase order with Living Works Education for training of the ASIST program.  These nonpersonal services will provide training, certification, caregiver knowledge, and confidence to intervene at risk suicide situations.  For the purpose of uniformity, Living Works Education is the only source that can satisfy the Government requirements of inter-Air Force and inter-U.S. Services operability, because Living Works ASIST program is already used for suicide intervention certification among professional and non-professional caregivers within the Air Force Air Mobility Command, the U.S. Navy, and the U.S. Army.  Living Works is the sole proprietor and certifier of trainers of the ASIST program.  This procurement is authorized in accordance with 10 USC 2304(C)(1).  The proposed solicitation is for nonpersonal services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. and is a follow-on to Education Training previously conducted by Living Works. No solicitation document exists.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals via email to Darla.Clifton@Langley.af.mil.or Lois.Nicholson@Langley.af.mil.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination by the Government to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>DESC: The US EPA Office of Science Coordination and Policy (OSCP) is in the process of implementing the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) mandated by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA).  Under this program, EPA is standardizing and validating a Tier 1 Battery of in vitro and in vivo mammalian and non-mammalian (i.e., fish) toxicity screening assays and a Tier 2 Battery of longer term mammalian and non-mammalian (i.e., fish, birds, and amphibians) toxicity tests.  The Tier 1 Battery will enable the Agency to determine whether a chemical substance may interact with certain endocrine systems (i.e., estrogen, androgen, and thyroid endpoints).  The Tier 2 Battery will enable the Agency to determine whether the substance causes an adverse effect, identify the adverse effect, and establish a quantitative relationship between the dose and the adverse effect.  Detailed information on the specific assays being standardized and validated for possible inclusion in the two batteries can be obtained from the EPA website for the EDSP: http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/oscpendo/index.htm.  Due to the rapid evolution of endocrine disruptor research, EPA is interested in new screening assays that have been developed or are currently being developed (i.e., developed beyond the research stage).  Specifically, EPA is interested in assays that may offer distinct advantages (i.e., reduced animal use, more cost-effective, and/or shorter in duration) over the Tier 1 assays currently being standardized and validated under the EDSP.  Through this Request for Information (RFI), EPA aims to provide an opportunity for Federal, State, and local jurisdiction laboratories, commercial laboratories, academia, and other interested parties to furnish EPA with information on new screening assays.  These new assays may be appropriate for inclusion in a future second version of the Tier 1 Battery.  Responses to this RFI should be brief (15 pages or less) and should include the scientific basis and strengths/weaknesses of the assay, the developmental status of the assay, a summary of any supporting data (including data on intra-laboratory reproducibility of the assay), additional work considered necessary for assay standardization, and the relevant experience of the key investigator(s).  If any response contains proprietary information, the responder should clearly identify which portions of the response are considered to be confidential business information.  EPA will use the information provided in the responses to this RFI to assess the number and status of potentially relevant assays.  Based on that assessment, EPA will decide whether to issue a solicitation for the demonstration and optimization of potentially promising assays. This RFI is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Responses to this RFI will not be considered as proposals or offers which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Address responses to: Dr. Jan Tan, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW (7201M), Washington, DC 20460, Courier or FedEx to: US EPA, OPPTS/OSCP, Attn: Dr. Jan Tan, 1201 Constitution Ave., NW, Room 4106, Washington, DC 22004, or submit your response electronically to tan.jan@epa.gov.  All final written responses to this RFI should be received by May 30, 2002.

Anticipated performance period is one year with a one-year option to support the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS)-10/Defense Support Program (DS)-22 launch and early orbit mission, and other 21 SOPS operational missions.  The effort is for management and labor to conduct operations, operations support, level-1 software and database maintenance, and training and simulation support for 21 SOPS operational missions.  It will include highly specialized support for IUS/DSP operations.  The IUS is an unmanned, two stage solid rocket motor booster launched from either a Titan IV rocket or from the Space Shuttle payload bay, and can deliver a spacecraft of over 5,000 pounds to a near-geosynchronous orbit.  This effort also encompasses support to the following missions, directly related to the IUS mission proficiency: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) programs including the Space Transportation System (STS - a.k.a. Space Shuttle), the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite (NOAA), the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TRDSS), and the Propulsive Small Expendable Deployer System (ProSEDS).  Booster programs include Athena I, Athena II, Delta II, Delta III, Titan II, and Atlas. Support for these operations is multifaceted, with each part integral to the others.  It requires console operators to configure AFSCN resources and provide telemetry, tracking, and commanding connectivity to the IUS vehicle during launch.  Launch preparation activities include pre-launch testing, IUS vehicle and system training to Air Force flight Directors, simulation support to the entire IUS Flight Team, procedural planning for launch operations, and Level 1 software and database maintenance support to configure and optimize the software and databases of the Common User Equipment and Mission Unique Equipment used to conduct IUS missions.  NASA and Booster Operations require telemetry, tracking and commanding to support launch and early orbit of the Space Shuttle, NOAA, and TDRSS satellites.  This includes emergency telemetry support through the AFSCN for NOAA and TDRSS as well as operational planning, execution, and evaluation for the Athena I, Athena II, Delta II, Delta III, Titan II, and Atlas booster programs.  Other requirements include routing and recording of telemetry data from AFSCN resources to either the Eastern or Western Ranges, bent-pipe telemetry throughput at various phases of a booster mission, such as during vehicle separation, booster evasive maneuvers, and depletion burns.
