<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information. The applicable NAICS is 611430: Professional Development Training. The responses to this market survey will be used for information purposes only. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. BACKGROUND: The FAA released a Request for Information (RFI) on August 1, 2007 to solicit industry comments on a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). On September 10, 2007, the FAA hosted an Industry Day to address the agency's ATCOTS program, requirements, the changing air traffic control training environment, and other program directives.  The FAA used the knowledge gained from both information exchanges to develop a draft Screening Information Request (SIR) in preparation for the future ATCOTS competition.  GENERAL DESCRIPTION: While the FAA is currently engaged in the development of a solicitation for ATCOTS, we are at a point where we seek industry comment on key sections of the draft SIR. The attached draft PWS, draft Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) and corresponding data items descriptions (DIDs), and draft Sections L &M are provided for Industry comment. The attached documents describe the goals and requirements of the FAA, and give interested vendors an idea of what the final solicitation may look like. Additionally, the FAA requests responses to questions that appear as an attachment to this announcement. The FAA may release other draft sections of the SIR for industry comment as well in future public announcements. Note: This acquisition will be conducted on a full and open competitive basis in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS). Currently, draft sections do not contain specific language that addresses the FAA's Small Business goals. However, all interested vendors should be aware that all offerors that are not Small Businesses will be expected to provide a subcontracting plan that describes the offeror's subcontracting goals and commitment to assuring that small, small disadvantaged and women-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns are provided the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in ATCOTS. In addition to the attachments provided in this announcement, the following links to the FAA's Air Traffic Technical Training Order 3120.4L and the FAA's Workplan for the Air Traffic Controller Workforce is provided for information purposes only.  3120.4L http://www.faa.gov/airports_airtraffic/air_traffic/publications/at_orders/media/TRN.pdf Workplan http://www.faa.gov/airports_airtraffic/air_traffic/controller_staffing/media/CWFP_final2007.pdf The FAA requests all responses (i.e. questions and comments) be provided in Word 2002 format. Interested vendors should respond to this announcement by providing the items listed below: 1.	Questions and/or comments regarding the draft documents provided in this announcement.  2.	Responses to FAA Questions.  3.	Complete FAA Business Declaration form. All responses should be submitted electronically not later than 4:00PM (EDT), November 8, 2007 to darryl.anderson@faa.gov.  Hardcopies can be sent to the following address: Federal Aviation Administration  ATTN: Darryl Anderson, AJA-48, Room 406 800 Independence Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20591 Please appropriately mark any proprietary information accordingly.  All responses received by the FAA will be treated as Proprietary Information unless otherwise requested by the individual submitter. The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this announcement.  This is not a request for proposals. INDUSTRY DAY In an effort to provide interested vendors the opportunity to learn more about the ATCOTS program, the FAA intends to host another Industry Day in the 3rd Floor Auditorium of the FAA Headquarters building in Washington, DC on Wednesday, November 14, 2007, from 2-4pm. This event will provide a forum for open discussion on the ATCOTS program and give vendors an opportunity to ask questions about requirements, acquisition strategy, and the current air traffic controller training environment. Additionally, the FAA is willing to conduct one-on-one information meetings with interested vendors only on November 15. These meetings will be limited to 60 minutes and no more than five (5) representatives from each vendor can participate in the session with the ATCOTS Team.  Note: The one-on-one meetings are not mandatory, and are not being requested by the FAA. The meetings are being offered because some offerors are reluctant to ask questions or express their acquisition ideas in a public forum. The FAA will not reveal or discuss information that hasn't been made available to all interested vendors. No vendors should expect to gain a competitive advantage as a result of this alternative information exchange. Vendors should request a one-on-one meeting only if absolutely necessary.  All vendors interested in attending the industry day should submit a list of the names and titles of its company representatives to the FAA Contracting Officer not later than 12:00 noon Eastern Time on November 2, 2007. Vendors with foreign national employees attending the industry day should complete the FAA form 1600-78, and include with the list of names. The list can be sent via email to Darryl Anderson at darryl.anderson@faa.gov. Included with the email, vendors must express their interest in participating in a one-on-one meeting and provide the names of the individuals and a company point of contact that will be representing their organization during the exclusive meeting with the FAA. The FAA will provide each interested vendor with the location and time for each session.   All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any costs incurred that are associated with any submissions received from industry in response to this market survey. All costs associated with this market survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense.

The Smithsonian Institution seeks interested contractors to establish an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Architect-Engineer (A/E) Contract that would provide design support for Smithsonian facilities located in the Tucson, Arizona area.  After award of an IDIQ contract, A/E services will be provided on a work order contract basis.  It is anticipated that the contract will be for a period of one year with nine one-year options and that the contract may provide a maximum design effort of $1,000,000 per year, with individual work orders not to exceed $500,000 in total for Title I and /or non-Title I services.  The NAICS code is 541330 with a small business standard of $4.5 million dollars.


1. PROJECT INFORMATION:  Services to be provided include but are not limited to the following: architectural and engineering studies, testing and analyses; facility and project planning; conceptual design; facilities assessment; evaluation of projects; presentations for project review by various bodies including the National Forrest Service; cost estimating for project proposals and detailed construction cost estimating; value engineering; code compliance and accessibility review; commissioning; development of contract documents comprised of drawings and specifications for architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, fire protection, security systems and hazardous materials abatement for a variety of small projects.  Firms unable to accept hazardous materials abatement projects need not apply.  Typically the work includes minor repairs, building renovation, facility improvement projects, interior space planning, and a limited amount of new facility development.  While the work may involve implementing portions of facility master plan projects developed by others, the greater number of work orders will be for smaller projects.  Post design services may include construction bid and negotiation support, construction administration, submittal reviews and/or construction coordination, and preparation of as-built record drawings.  A/E?s will be expected to respond to Smithsonian requests for service with expediency, thoroughness and a high level of design quality.  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. Minority owned firms are strongly encouraged to apply.

2. SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS: If the selected firm is a large business, a subcontracting plan consistent with PL 95-507, PL 99-661 and PL 100-656 will be required with the final fee proposal. A minimum of 23% of the total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with small business concerns. At least 8%  of total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with Small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), including Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions; 5% with Women-owned small businesses (WOSB); 3% shall be placed with Hub-zone Small Businesses (HubSB), 3% with Veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB); and 3% with Service Disabled Veteran-owned small businesses (SDV). The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal. Any prime or joint venture found to be officially notified of non-compliance on past contracts and the non-compliance is outstanding will not be considered for this project. Failure to adequately explain reasons for not meeting previous contract goals may result in a lower overall rating and ultimate non-selection.  An approved small business-subcontracting plan will be required prior to award.      

3. SELECTION CRITERIA: Firm evaluation and selection will be conducted in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer (A/E) Act as implemented by FAR Subpart 36.6, refer to Numbered Note 24 on fedbizopps and will be based on the following criteria:

Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other
restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

Request for Written Quotation will be issued.  The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.
The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.

AWARD WILL NOT BE WITHHELD AWAITING QUALIFICATION.  For qualification information/source approval requests contact OC-ALC/BC, 3001 Staff Drive, Ste #1AC85A, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3009.

The Contractor must provide a qualified replacement capable of passing a favorable Security Background Check.  This policy also applies to any personnel hired as replacements during the term of the contract.  The Contracting Officer must approve all personnel replacements.

10.4.	Notification of Personnel Changes

The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer via phone, FAX, or electronic transmission, no later than one work day after any personnel changes occur. Written confirmation is required for phone notification.  This includes, but is not limited to, name changes, resignations, terminations, and reassignments (i.e., to another contract.)

<DESC>The Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Amarillo Field Office has a requirement for a follow-on contract for engineering services to conduct on-going engineering evaluations and studies of a 310-Bcf gas storage reservoir that contains approximately 21 Bcf of injected Government and privately owned helium in a partially depleted natural gas field approximately 15 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas.  The original and follow-on contracts, NAR020100 and NAC030064, were small business set-asides, awarded to NITEC, LLC of Denver Colorado, in June 2002 and July 2003 respectively.  Under these contracts NITEC, LLC performed engineering studies to (1) determine the validity of using the bhp/z vs. cumulative production curve to determine ultimate, recoverable reserves; (2) estimated the structure and volume of the reservoir; and (3) developed a model and simulation of the reservoir using off-the-shelf and customized computer software products.  NITEC, LLC reviewed prior engineering reports, available pressure tests, deliverability tests, production and injection volumes and related gas compositions.  From this, NITEC, LLC developed a material balance equation that confirmed the reserve volumes used by the BLM.  Much of this work would have to be repeated, at extra time and cost, by any new consultant before starting the history match phase of reservoir simulation.  Additionally, NITEC, LLC analyzed the available geological data, the Brown Dolomite, and completed structure maps for the Brown Dolomite.  Much of the geophysical analysis was completed using proprietary software.  All of the logs and core data for the field were analyzed, and then the results used to quantify the extent and characteristics of natural fracturing.  Pressure build-up tests were evaluated to tie performance based reservoir permeability to that obtained from cores.  Any other consultant would have to repeat much of the above work, at extra time and cost, before even beginning a simulation.  For the above-stated reasons, the circumstances permitting other than full and open competition as cited in 41 U.S.C.253(c)(2), and FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" are germaine to this procurement.  This statutory authority applies as a follow-on contract awarded to anyone other than NITEC, LLC would result in substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  As such, the BLM intends to award an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity, Task Order contract, with a base year and four options, sole source, to NITEC, LLC, for the follow-on effort described above.  Questions regarding this procurement may be directed to Elaine E. Flick, the Contracting Officer, at 303-236-3528.  See Note 22!

<DESC>***************PLEASE CONTACT MARY BRINKEY ONLY FOR TECHNICAL OR QUOTE ISSUES. MARY BRINKEY CONTACT INFORMATION IS IN THE BODY OF THIS SOLICITATION***************** NASA/MSFC has a requirement for LIQUID METHANE.  Methane will be needed for at least the next two months and as long as up to one year.  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the liquid methane from Clean Energy Fuels Corp. on a sole source basis. The award of a new contract will seriously impact the ability of MSFC to meet its obligations to its customers.	 Also, Clean Energy Fuel Corp. is aware of the hazardous safety concerns as a propellent delivery provider at MSFC and another provider would need instruction and this would cause further delay in delivery of methane.    The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>FA8621-06-C-6300, C-130J Maintenance and Aircrew Training Systems (MATS) Program.  This is a pre-solicitation synopsis and a complete  re-procurement package is not available.  The 77 Aeronautical Systems  Wing, 677 Aeronautical Systems Group, Training Systems (677 AESG/TS)  intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Lockheed Martin  Simulation, Training and Support (LM STS) to procure a C-130J MATS System  Integration Laboratory (SIL) for Block Upgrade purposes for the MATS  program.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The  purpose of this pre-solicitation notice is to determine if any competitive  sources exist and to notify industry of the impending action so that  possible subcontracting activities may be pursued. The proposed contract will procure an engineering device to be used to  develop, produce and verify all concurrency block modifications to the  training devices in MATS program.  The SIL will match the current hardware  and software configuration of fielded C-130J MATS training devices.  This  engineering device will be primarily used as a test bed to incorporate new  block upgrade requirements into the current C-130J MATS training baseline.  The device will be developed and delivered to the C-130J aircraft Block  7.0 configuration.  The engineering device will remain at the contractor’s  facility indefinitely to provide the contractor a dedicated device for  their efforts and prevent fielded devices from being removed from student  training service and to be used as a test bed during concurrency  modification development. The government intends to award the effort pursuant to the authority of 10  U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 since LM STS is the only  contractor that possesses the necessary knowledge, experience and  technical data required to support the system.  The proposed contract  action, FA8621-06-C-6300, has an initial period of performance of thirty  months.  The training devices impacted by these concurrency block  modifications are located at both Continental United States (CONUS) and  outside Continental United States (OCONUS) operational sites. Interested offerors must submit, within 15 days from the publication date  of this notice, their capability package describing the company’s  technical expertise and experience, personnel and facilities, and  motivation for participating in this program.  Responses should be sent  to:  677 AESG/TS (C-130J MATS), 2300 D Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH  45433-746, and Attn:  Rhonda Miller, email Rhonda.Miller@wpafb.af.mil  Any  technical questions should be referred to Dan Annett at (937) 255-3648,  email Daniel.Annett@wpafb.af.mil.  The contracting Officer is Norma  Weikert, (937) 255-7288, email Norma.weikert@wpafb.af.mil. For subcontracting opportunities, interested parties may submit  appropriate information via email to Judy Ghormley at (770) 494-9518, or  judy.ghormley@lmco.com at LM STS. The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this  procurement action is 336413.  Please indicate number of employees  relative to the size standard of 1,500 for determination of small business  status.  Respondees shall include their assigned DUNS number and their  Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  An Ombudsman has been  appointed to hear concerns during the proposal development phase of this  acquisition.  The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the  authority of the Program Manager or Contracting Officer, but to  communicate the contractor’s concerns, issues, disagreements, and  recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested,  the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the  concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of  proposals or in source selection.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for a Binary Print Compare Utility that meets U.S. Government Section 508 compliance standards (Visually Impaired/Blind Accessibility).  This product needs to be fully Section 508 compliant, or data should be provided as to when should be fully Section 508 compliant.  The IRS requires that all interested vendors address how their product meets or will meet each of the technical standards listed under ?Subpart B?Technical Standards 1194.21 or 1194.22 found at this site: http://www.section508.gov/ (http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=12#Software).

Technical Requirements:

The Internal Revenue Service produces taxpayer notices in IBM Advanced Function Printing (AFP) format using several document composition tools, including Document Sciences Compuset, and IBM Elixir DesignPro Tools.  Taxpayer notices are currently produced on an IBM zSeries mainframe, running IBM z/OS operating system.

We have begun a multi-year effort to migrate taxpayer notice production to a new hardware platform: Sun UltraSPARC running Sun Solaris operating system.  Taxpayer notices will be produced on the Sun using the Document Sciences product xPression.

As we migrate the production of taxpayer notices from the IBM zSeries mainframe using legacy document composition tools to the new Sun environment utilizing Document Sciences xPression, we require a binary compare utility which will allow us to compare print files electronically.  The utility should report the differences between the files in an easily understandable format, or report that files have no differences when no differences exist.  The utility needs to provide the capability to ?mask? differences, be able to compare a ?Reference file? ? and ?Test file? ? of differing sizes, compare reference file and test file with differing encoding and /or byte ordering, compare AFP files with differing internal structures, compare non-printable fields such as Tag Logical Elements (TLEs).  The utility is not required to run on a Sun UltraSPARC running the Sun Solaris operating system; however it is deemed beneficial due to the long range vision of notice migration.

Below is a detailed explanation of each requirement:

1.	Compare AFP files generated with the same or different composition tools on the 
same or different hosts (z/OS and Solaris).  The table below summarizes possible combinations.
Reference File created on Host / using Composition tool:	Test File created on: Host /using Composition tool
z/OS / Legacy composition tools	z/OS / Legacy composition tools
Solaris/ xPression	Solaris/xPression
z/OS / mainframe composition tools	Solaris / xPression 
Solaris / xPression	z/OS /mainframe composition tools

2.  	Provide masking capabilities at the individual field, page, and document level to
allow comparison of files with the ability for the user to exclude reporting on known differences.  For example, reference and test files being compared could be composed using different fonts (arial versus helvetica), different font types (outline versus raster), different font sizes (12 point versus 8 point), or the reference file could contain a graphic image on the first page of each notice, while the test file does not contain the graphic image.  We require the ability to exclude known differences from the reporting.

3.  	Provide a method of synchronizing files, so that if the reference file and the test file contain differing numbers of records, the can be compared with an indication of which records occurred only on one file.

4.	Compare files with differing internal structures (MO:DCA print streams) This could be due to different structured fields or different MO:DCA triplets within a structured field.  For example, the reference file contains a page segment referred to in an ?Include Page Segment? (IPS) structured field.  In addition, for the reference file, the page segment is also mapped with a ?Map Page Segment? (MPS) structured field in the active environment group for that page.  The test file contains the same page segment referred to in an ?Include Page Segment? (IPS) structured field, but in the test file, the page segment is not mapped with a ?Map Page Segment? (MPS) structured field.  The printed output looks identical.  We need to know that the rendered output is identical.  (see requirement six below for non-printable fields).  Please see the IBM document number SG31-6802-07 Data Streams and Object Architecture Mixed Object Document Content Architecture Reference  for information on MO:DCA.

5.	Compare print files with different encoding schemes (ASCII, EBCDIC, UNICODE UTF-8 and UTF-16, big-endian and little-endian byte ordering) performing the appropriate translations so that files produced on different platforms can be accurately compared.  For example a reference file is created on z/OS with EBCDIC encoding with big-endian byte ordering, and the test file is created on a Sun Solaris 64-bit system with UTF-16E.  

6.	Tag Logical Elements (TLEs) if present in the print files being compared, must also be compared, and differences reported.

Statement of Need:

The purpose of this RFI is to determine if any vendors have a Binary Print Compare Utility that is Section 508 compliant and capable of fulfilling the technical requirements listed above.

Requested Response:

Your response must be limited to 5 pages.
As part of the response for each product, the responder should provide the following information for the Government?s consideration and review:

	We require each vendor to explain:
-If your product meets or exceeds each element in the technical standards listed in ?Subpart B - - Technical Standards 1194.21? Please include section number(s)   
  and  paragraph letters being addressed, and respond to section(s) appropriate to   
  the product.  This is expected to be section 1194.21 ?Software applications and 
  operating systems? paragraphs a through i, or section 1194.22 ?Web-based 
  intranet and internet information and applications? paragraphs a through p.  
  (Note that Section 508 compliance is for developers, business customers, and 
  field end-users use of the product)
  - Does the product meet each of the 6 technical requirements listed above and 
  - Does the product correctly interact with adaptive screen

<DESC>Building on earlier and ongoing Mission economic growth programs, the COnnecting Regional Economies (CORE) seeks to address the disparity in economic development between the North and East and the rest of Sri Lanka. This disparity is a major driver of Sri Lanka?s ongoing ethnic conflict. CORE can help establish
conditions conducive to a political solution to the conflict by fostering economic growth that addresses regional
and socio-cultural inequities.

CORE will provide technical assistance and training to accomplish the objectives of the program. In
addition, the CORE program will include a flexible small grants-under-contracts program of up to 10% of
the contract award to support small-scale infrastructure, business development services, support to
associations, chambers of commerce and others to promote peace-building economic growth activities.
Small grants will be limited to no more than the equivalent of US$100,000 per grant in order to ensure that a
significant number of grant activities are funded by a variety of groups working in the target conflictaffected
and ?strategic areas.
USAID will provide the contractor the equivalent of US$5 million in Sri Lankan Rupees from a PL 480
Title III Agreement local currency account held jointly with the Government of Sri Lanka to augment the
U.S. dollar obligated in the contract. These local currency funds are within the U.S. Government?s
maximum estimated budget stated in Section L. It is not additional to the stated budget amount (funding to
be made available). The local currency funds must be utilized by the contractor for small grants, microcredit,
local training and other closely related costs thereto. It will enhance the contractor?s ability to
improve food security and agricultural development, promote free and open markets, support microenterprise
development, and provide small grants for infrastructure activities in rural areas.
CORE will build upon the achievements of previous and ongoing USAID economic growth programs, while
bringing to the new program a strong emphasis on the more equitable distribution of benefits. The Mission
activities to date offer a number of examples of interventions with impacts that CORE may want to develop
further to the benefit of populations in conflict-affected and ?strategic areas.

The services provided by the Bankruptcy Noticing Center (BNC) program include, but will not be limited to the receipt of bankruptcy case related data in electronic format, production of bankruptcy notices, distribution of notices through the United States Postal Service or by electronic transmission, using the most cost efficient, timely and effective manner, and to provide program related reports to the AO and Bankruptcy Courts.
The contractor shall furnish managerial, administrative and direct labor personnel to accomplish all work under the contract. The process of producing and preparing notices for transmission is accomplished by the Bankruptcy Court staff and other entities, such as contractors, debtors, attorneys and trustees.  Under a contract managed by the AO, the BNC electronically retrieves data from participating courts case management systems and automates the printing, addressing, batching, and mailing process.  Since its inception in 1993, the BNC program has saved the Judiciary over $67 million in noticing costs and has improved service to the Bankruptcy Courts and notice recipients.  The volume of work will be dependent on the number of bankruptcy cases filed and the number of Bankruptcy Courts that use this program.  Presently, all 90 Bankruptcy Courts utilize the BNC with the exception of the Districts of the Virgin Island, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.  At this time, it is estimated that the number of notices prepared and served by the Bankruptcy Courts in fiscal year 2007 (October 1, 2006, through September 30, 2007) will be approximately 105 million.   Historical volume information and program cost information will be provided at the time the solicitation is posted.    Currently, the Government has a contract for operating a BNC through September 2008.     
This will be a fixed price, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract (IDIQ), as well as a performance-based with an award fee.  Anticipated performance is for one base period and nine-one year periods at the option of the Government. The contract does not have a set-aside requirement for small, service-disabled veterans, minority or woman-owned, or other businesses that can be classified under Government procurement set-aside definitions.

<DESC>The GLAC (US Dept of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center) is planning to negotiate a sole source contract with American Messaging Services to provide pager lease and service for the Hines IL VA Hospital for one year. This includes the lease of approximately 730 pagers, both numeric and alphanumeric; provision of air time; 24 x 7 service; additional and replacement pagers within 24 hours. This is considered to be a sole source because changing contractors for pagers is very disruptive and time-consuming for hospital staff, requires training on the new pagers, collection and redistribution of the pagers to the Cardiac Arrest team and results in high levels of dissatisfaction from hospital staff. Only the incumbent can continue to provide these services without disruption. The new contract, in combination with the current contract, will together run for about two (2) years, which is a reasonable amount of time over which to absorb the in-house costs and disruption resulting from a change of contractors. NAICS number is 517210. Size standard is 1500 employees. Other sources that believe they can meet VA needs, without disruption to pager service and to hospital staff, must furnish information about their products and services, as well as references, to this office by no later than 1:00 PM on October 30, 2007. Information may be mailed or it may be faxed to: 414-902-5440.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>AMCOM is interested in seeking information on disposition and reuse alternatives for LX-14 recovered from TOW Missile Warheads.  The current missile demilitarization program seeks to increase environmentally acceptable alternatives to conventional Op en Burn/Open Detonation (OB/OD) through closed disposal and component/compound reuse techniques.  As a result large quantities of LX-14 will require final disposition or reuse over the next 7 years.  The government is seeking industry responses that use pr ocesses, equipment and facilities that do not require research and development and/or facilitization.  This notice constitutes a request for information (RFI) from sources with expertise and knowledge of disposal and alternative uses for LX-14. It is intended that this RFI be open 14 days from the date of publication.   Information may be submitted by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineerin g (universities), or by consortia led by such concerns.   AMCOM encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, Hub-zone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran owned small business and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. This RFI is used for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.   All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI.   All interested responsible businesses are encouraged to submit questions or comments at any time prior to expiration of this RFI.  A complete copy of the RFI and response instructions can be found at webs ite: \https://wwwproc.redstone.army.mil/acquisition/.

<DESC>The USACE Vicksburg District intends to modify Contract No. DACW38-01-D-0005 with the URS Group, Inc. to increase the contract value by $10 million on a SOLE SOURCE BASIS under the authority provided by 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1).  The contract is an Ind efinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the Preparation of Design Report and Plans and Specifications (P&S) for the Construction of Houma Navigation Lock, Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico Hurricane Protection Project, Terrebonne Parish, Loui siana, New Orleans and Vicksburg Districts. Currently the contract has a value of $10 million with a base year and six option periods. The project design and P&S were near 50% completion when Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana. As a result of Hur ricanes Katrina and Rita the design flow line that governs the entire structural design of this project was significantly increased, requiring a portion of the design already complete to be substantially redesigned in order to regain the 50% complete statu s. The Vicksburg District has determined that modifying URS contract to complete the design from that point is the only reasonable means available to the Government to ensure mission requirements for completing the design of the Houma Navigation Canal Loc k and Floodgate from an economical and technical standpoint. Selection of a new firm to complete the design at this stage would result in delays that are unacceptable to local cost-sharing sponsors and additional costs associated with verification of compl eted work before assuming liability for the total design. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying Vicksburg Districts requirements may contact Mr. Randy Brown at 601 631-7249 for additional i nformation. A determination not to complete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) # 2006-N-08556 for full and open competition for research to support the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD).  The purpose of the awarded contract(s) is to provide public health practice, scientific, research and technical services in support of epidemiology, surveillance, prevention, intervention and laboratory programs to the NCBDDD.  (Additionally, a second RFP # 2006-N-08835 will be issued as an 8(a) small business set-aside. The particulars on the 8(a) set-aside will be provided by separate synopsis.) The RFP reserves the right of CDC to make multiple awards and compete task orders among the awardees. The RFP is anticipated to be issued in approximately 30 days.  The term of the awarded contracts will be 10 years, beginning around April 1, 2007.  The RFP will be available only by downloading at this internet site: www.fbo.gov/ . All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration in response to the RFP.  A wage determination has not been requested since the requirement involves meaningful numbers of professional employees as defined in FAR Subpart 22.11.

The mission of NCBDDD is to promote the health of babies, children, and adults, and enhance the potential for full, productive living including:

•	Identifying the causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities
•	Helping children to develop and reach their full potential
•	Promoting health and well-being among people of all ages with disabilities

The mission of NCBDDD requires a broad spectrum of surveillance, epidemiologic, research support,   prevention, intervention, and laboratory services related to public health, the environment and human genetics.

NCBDDD requires services such as would normally be available from an in-house scientific and technical staff.  These individuals are skilled in epidemiology, child development, health education, communication and promotion and surveillance relating to adverse reproductive outcomes, disability, environmental hazards, and natural and technological disasters.  Task orders will require personnel with diverse skills in statistics, research design, literature review and analysis, public health practice, surveillance, biostatics, GIS, epidemiology, toxicology, environmental exposure assessment, informatics, data management, clinical  and laboratory methods, data analysis, policy analysis and assessment, formative activities, conducting program assessments, conducting evaluation studies, performing data abstraction, clinician reviews and coordination and assistance in program management,  providing scientific and technical support, preparation of IRB and OMB packages, serving in partner and community liaison roles, training development and presentation, and multi-site activities.

Zakin, DARPA/DSO; Ph:  (703) 248-1509, Email:  BAA07-21@darpa.mil; URL:  http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm; Website Submission:  http://www.sainc.com/dsobaa/

DESCRIPTION

(Note:  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Addendum 7 is submitted as a Special Focus Area as described in the original BAA, 07-21.)

The properties of future military systems must be more fluid and controllable in order to meet the challenges of complex missions. One means of achieving such enhanced capability is the development of dynamic materials which can be directly programmed to reversibly change their fundamental properties, on demand and in real-time, when desired by the user. These properties include size, shape, form factor, and moduli. Such programmable materials will create revolutionary new capabilities for the warfighter. A simple example would be an ?Instant Toolkit,? an amorphous material that can be programmed to instantly become a hammer, wrench, or screwdriver on demand, and then return to its initial form so it can be reused.

In response to this challenge, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking innovative proposals to develop Programmable Matter:  a new functional form of matter constructed from mesoscale building blocks (?MesoParticles? up to 1 cm size), which reversibly assemble into complex 3D objects upon external command. These 3D objects will exhibit all the functionality of their conventional counterparts. Programmable Matter represents the convergence of chemistry, information theory, and control, into a new materials design paradigm, referred to here as ?InfoChemistry,? building information directly into materials.

A key feature of Programmable Matter is the MesoParticle-based construction. At the mesoscale level, building blocks are large enough to contain intricate structures with real functionality. MesoParticles can have a variety of sizes, shapes, compositions, and functions; they communicate and interlock with their neighbors to create dynamic bulk structures with mechanical integrity. Building blocks can include mesoscale computers, wireless transmitters, machines, gears, fluidics, and other devices, as well as polymer, metal, ceramic, and other particles. MesoParticles are of sufficient size to build practical macroscale objects. Importantly, MesoParticles exhibit the critical feature of separability of structure and function:  the external geometry determines packing, assembly, and bulk structure, while the interior has the machinery to process information, generate action, etc. In principle, separability can be exploited to create dynamic materials of unprecedented complexity and capability. 

In order to create 3D objects from building blocks, Programmable Matter must be capable of performing the following key unit operations in sequence:  

1.	Activate by external signal;
2.	Decode and propagate instructions;
3.	Translate information into action;
4.	Transport particles and assemble shapes;
5.	Interlock particles to form object;
6.	Perform error-checking and encode final state information;
7.	Activate by external signal; and
8.	Disassemble into starting materials.

The first phase of this program focuses on the design and modeling of practical Programmable Matter with manufacturable properties. The second phase focuses on experimental realization of the key elements of Programmable Matter:  assembly of 3D solid objects of varying geometry from a common set of building blocks, and reversible interlocking of MesoParticles to create bulk materials with the elastic modulus of typical plastics. The specific Phase I/II milestones are presented under the Program Goals and Milestones section. 

BACKGROUND
Critical features that must be considered in the development of Programmable Matter include:

Chemistry:  (1) Mesoscale particles with the right size, shape, composition, and functionality; (2) Means for transporting particles around in fluid and dry states; and (3) Interlocking/adhesive mechanisms to reversibly hold particles together and create materials with mechanical integrity.

Information Theory:  Particles that variably decode and encode information (i.e., instruction sets), propagate information, and translate instructions into action (e.g., bind, move, etc.), in response to internal or external commands.

Control:  Particles that are addressable by external means (e.g., EM field), and that ideally have error-checking capability to test the structural/functional integrity of the assembled object.

To achieve the Programmable Matter vision, key technological breakthroughs will center on the following critical areas:

1.	Encoding information into chemistry, or fusing materials with machines;
2.	Fabrication of mesoscale particles with arbitrary complex shapes, composition, and function;
3.	Interlocking/adhesion mechanisms that are strong AND reversible;
4.	Global assembly strategies that translate information into action; and
5.	Mathematical theory for construction of 3D objects from particles.

Of critical importance are radical new material architectures that maximize the efficiency of information processing/transfer, and design rules for the optimal number, size, and shape of particles required to create objects of a specific size and spatial feature resolution.

Any innovative approach for Programmable Matter that meets the goals of this BAA will be considered.

PROGRAM GOALS AND MILESTONES
The goal of this program is to demonstrate a new functional form of matter, based on mesoscale particles, which can reversibly assemble into complex 3D objects upon external command.

Program Phases
The Programmable Matter Program will be separated into three phases. The goal of Phase I is to develop designs, theoretical models and computer simulations for Programmable Matter. The goal of Phase II is the physical realization of Programmable Matter. Depending on the success of the Phase II demonstrations, the goal of Phase III will be to develop fully-functional Programmable Matter for specific applications.

Phase I will be a 6-month research effort. Phase II will be a research effort of 18 months or less; shorter duration efforts are strongly encouraged.

A successful proposal will thoroughly cover all details for meeting the milestones set forth for both Phase I and Phase II. Thus programs should be submitted as 24-month (or less) efforts encompassing both Phase I and an optional Phase II, including detailed budgets for both phases.  At the end of each phase, performance will be evaluated based on achievement of the stated milestones.  Successful completion of Phase I does not guarantee selection in Phase II.

Program Milestones
The Phase I milestone is:

1.	Build a mathematical model that, given a set of mesoscale particles with manufacturable properties, theoretically confirms at least one viable procedure for constructing and disassembling macroscopic 3D solid objects under external command. The objects must have functional properties that are useful in the real world (e.g., a wrench).

The Phase II milestones are:

1.	Starting with a single set of mesoscale particles, experimentally demonstrate externally-directed assembly of four distinct macroscopic 3D solids (cube, cylinder, sphere, triangular prism), each ~100 cm3 in volume;

2.	Experimentally demonstrate interlocking/adhesion of mesoscale particles to create bulk matter with an elastic modulus typical of plastics (0.2 to 4 GPa), followed by unlocking to recover the original particles.

Phase III is expected to be a research effort of between 18 and 24 months. The Phase III milestones will be determined by the results of the Phase I/II effort and the specific applications that are proposed. 

To realize the program vision and meet the Phase I/II milestones, each research effort requires performers with expertise in materials chemistry and physics, information theory, control theory, modeling, and computer simulation. Teaming is encouraged, especially when interdisciplinary approaches to a problem are required.

FULL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
All proposals submitted electronically by means of an Electronic Business Application Tool or proposal submission web site (not including Grants.gov) must be encrypted using Winzip or PKZip with 256-bit AES encryption.  Only one zipped/encrypted file will be accepted per proposal and proposals not zipped/encrypted will be rejected by DARPA.

1010 Required Elements of Physical Examination:

1.	Pre-Placement, Mandatory Periodic, and Termination (Exit) Examinations: (See Appendix D)

The SF78, 93, and OSHA Form 22 must be completed and signed by the employee and examining physician (Appendices G-2, G-3, and G-9).

Clinical tests to be included:

a)	Vision Screening ? far, near, depth, color, fields, peripheral, lateral/vertical phoria, monocular, and binocular with and without glasses or contacts, tonometry;

b)	Vital Signs ? blood pressure, temperature, body height and weight, pulse, skin;

c)	Laboratory tests to be included:  complete blood count (hematology), urinalysis, glucose, cholesterol, chemistry (see FOH work orders 4423, 4513, 4437, or 4455 (Appendix E);

d)	EKG tracing and interpretation;

e)	Chest x-ray, report with interpretation of the x-ray, and B-read (Appendices G-6 and G-7);

f)	Pulmonary function test (Spirometry) with interpretation (3 curves); and 

g)	Audiometry (Frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000): 14-hour noise free period prior to testing.  If there is a Standard Threshold Shift (STS), a repeat test must be given within 14 days.

There is to be a doctor-patient discussion of significant findings on the examination.  The doctor is to send a copy of the physical examination and tests to the patient and to the MRO.

2.	Mine Rescue Team Examination:

Note:  While many of the clinical and laboratory tests are the same as in pre-placement, mandatory periodic, and termination examinations, the standards are more stringent.  The physical examination is done annually and the chest x-ray is done with the physical every third year (See Appendix H ? Mine Rescue Guidelines).

The examining physician must conduct an in-depth medical history according to 30 CFR 49.7 
Clinical tests to be included:
		
a)	Vision Screening: far, near, depth, color, fields, peripheral, lateral/vertical phoria, monocular, and binocular with and without glasses or contacts, tonometry;

b)	Vital Signs: blood pressure, temperature, body height and weight, pulse, skin;

c)	Laboratory Tests to include ? complete blood count (hematology), urinalysis, glucose, cholesterol, chemistry [see FOH work orders 4423, 4513, 4437, or 4455 (Appendix E)];


d)	EKG tracing and interpretation;

e)	Chest X-Ray, report with interpretation of the x-ray, B-Read (Appendices G-6 and G-7);

f)	Pulmonary Function Test (Spirometry) with interpretation (3 curves); and

g)	Audiometry (Frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000): 14-hour noise free period prior to testing.  If there is a Standard Threshold Shift (STS), a repeat test must be given within 14 days.

The exam must include a doctor-patient discussion of positive findings on examination.  The doctor is to send a copy of the physical examination and tests to the patient and to the MRO.

MSHA Checklist for Periodic/Exit Exams

The examining physician must discuss the medical history form (SF 93) and any pre-existing conditions with patient.  The examining physician must then address and document any positive medical history, physical findings, and significant abnormal lab values before exam is sent for QA.  Ensure that all requested forms and test results are attached!  Incomplete forms and missing test results ultimately delay the review which can restrict employees from regular duties.

<DESC>A detailed Statement of Work will be published in the future Request for Proposal posting. Below is a summary of the required EAP Services requirements: Eastern Colorado Healthcare System (ECHCS) - approximately 2000 employees Includes:   Medical Center and Nursing Home, Lakewood CBOC, Fitzsimmons CBOC,  Health Administration Center (HAC) - approximately 700 employees Southern Colorado area (SoCO) - approximately 250 employees.  Includes:   Pueblo Nursing Home, Alamosa CBOC, Colorado Springs CBOC, LaJunta CBOC, Lamar CBOC, Pueblo CBOC, Burlington CBOC and support offices located in La Junta, Las Animas, and Pueblo. A.	Objective of the Employee Assistance Program (EAP):   Provide access to appropriate prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programs and services for employees of the ECHCS and Health Administration Center with alcohol, drug, mental, emotional, family or other personal problems which adversely affect job performance, and to provide guidance for supervisors to effectively handle problems of employees which adversely affect job performance. B.	General Description of Services:   Programs and services will be provided by an independent, local, counseling service for assessment, referral and limited counseling, with costs paid by the ECHCS and the Health Administration Center.  Costs of additional counseling services will be paid by employees or their health insurance providers.  Referrals of employees and/or eligible family members may be self-referral or by any supervisor of the ECHCS or Health Administration Center.   For our Southern Colorado offices, we will not require an on-site counselor, but instead the use of a 1-800 number for employees to call and set up face-to-face meetings with a provider in their area, also including up to six (6) visits per employee.

In the event that it is impossible to provide statistical data and still protect the identity of an employee, protection of the employee's identity shall take precedence. 3.	Since problems at home may affect job performance, coverage will be extended to members of employee's families when appropriate.

Supervisors may use the program to refer employees to the program or to obtain guidance when personal problems of subordinate staff cause unsatisfactory job performance.  It is the intent of the program to provide for intervention only when problems affect job performance or reflect discredit to the participating agency. These policies do not alter nor replace any existing administrative policies or contractual agreements of ECHCS or Health Administration Center, but are intended merely to assist ECHCS and Health Administration Center to carry out existing policies. D.	Program Requirements:    The contractor is expected to provide, at a minimum, the following: 1.

<DESC>U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Irradiation Apparatus Manufacturing.
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Irradiation Apparatus Manufacturing.  According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply these classes of products to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Pamela M. Fenderson, Program Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Pamela M. Fenderson, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 205-205-7408; by FAX at (202) 481-4783; or by email at Pamela.Fenderson@sba.gov
.
.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.? 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR ?121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA?s regulations at 13 CFR ?121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding system.  The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Irradiation Apparatus Manufacturing North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334517 product number 6525. 
The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class of NAICS code within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Business Opportunities.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
Studies of Global Remote-Sensing Measurements of Trace Gases
October 25, 2007

This Request for Information synopsis is published for market research purposes only in order to identify interested parties capable of studying the development and validation of a robust testbed for assessing the feasibility of global remote sensing measurements of trace gases and to describe the error characteristics associated with various instrument scenarios in this arena for the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).  The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, and/or capabilities for planning purposes.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

The NPOESS is a satellite system used to monitor global environmental conditions, and collect and disseminate data related to: weather, atmosphere, oceans, land and near-space environment.  The NOPESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) organizationally resides within the Department of Commerce, NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS).  The Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), created the IPO to develop, acquire, manage, and operate the NOPESS satellites.  The NOPESS requirements were developed by the user community and are captured in the NPOESS Integrated Operational Requirements (IORD).  To achieve its mission, the IPO has undertaken a far-reaching program of sensor development, and satellite transition and evolution to provide complete coverage of environmental conditions for civil, military, and scientific purposes.  The IPO?s operational effectiveness depends on its ability to keep pace with rapidly developing technologies.  To accomplish this, the IPO researches and develops initiatives through its Internal Government Studies (IGS) program.  The IGS program consists of teams of scientists and engineers from Government laboratories and centers, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, universities, and industry.  These teams are tasked to identify and test requirements and objectives.

The applicable NAICS code is 541512 and the size standard is $23,000,000.  The purpose of the study is to develop better access to resources for animal models of human disease and enhance the ability to search across multiple animal models as well as to capture specific models information that may be relevant to multiple diseases.  One award is anticipated under a separate RFP.  The Contractor will be responsible for performing the following tasks related to creating an electronic directory: 1) Identify the sources where the data and information about animal models exist;  2) Create a comprehensive meta-model for collecting data about the sources, the models and the data;  3) Implement the meta-model in a database;  4) Populate the database with the actual data about the identified models;  5) Survey the market of users to facilitate data collection;  6) Develop a website with the description of the project;  7) Identify relevant standards, taxonomies and ontologies;  8)  Popularize the resource and develop tutorials and online help for new users and develop a model of community involvement; 9) Design a portal for integration of data, models and knowledge about animal models; 10) Develop a blueprint for integration of the electronic directory of models with existing knowledge structures; 11) Test potentially advantageous new methods for data and knowledge integration; and 12) Develop a 'tracking' system that will allow recording, managing and comparing various pathways of data and knowledge processing and integration. Small business firms having demonstrated experience in performing tasks 1-12 above are invited to submit capability statements (original and two copies).  Capability statements must provide evidence of experience in performing the tasks described above and demonstrate the following: 1) Qualifications and availability of personnel with experience pertinent to the development, maintenance and operation of the electronic directory and the associated portal as an independent and reliable source of information about disease models tools and resources, including interacting constructively with the animal models and related research resource communities;  2) Adequacy of the organizational and project management structure to ensure appropriate staffing, resources and management processes for each task;  3) Facilities, equipment and resources necessary for the performance of the requirements listed above; and 4) The firm's status as a small business under NAICS code 541512.  Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). THERE IS CURRENTLY NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE. 
Program Executive Office (Tactical Aircraft Programs) (PEO(T)) is seeking potential sources and industry comments/feedback for the potential acquisition of services to perform an AoA to begin in February 2008. The contractor is requested to identify the ROM cost to complete an AoA.  
NGJ will enhance DoN?s existing Stand-off/Mod escort jamming capability.  The NGJ Functional Area Analysis (FAA)/ Functional Needs Analysis (FNA)/ Functional Solutions Analysis (FSA) effort is currently being finalized.  The Head, Aviation and Aircraft Plans and Programs (N880) Pre-Concept Refinement and Analysis of Alternatives letters to PEO(T) emphasize the importance of conducting an AoA.
History:  The Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) analyzed AEA in the context of a complete System of Systems architecture and led to the development of the AEA Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).  AEA primarily focuses on Electro-Magnetic Spectrum Dominance, both in the air and on the ground.  Traditionally, Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) required jamming enemy radars and communications for strike group protection.  Combined arms and ground forces support, especially in other than conventional combat, has expanded the target set. 
Although some improvements for the ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System (TJS) are in progress, no major upgrades are planned to address emerging and future threats.  NGJ is envisioned to enable coalition missions by countering enemy advancements in radars, communications and highly integrated air defense systems both on shore, at sea and in the air.  NGJ will also enable effective information operations/ asymmetric combat against commercial technology applications.
Scope:  The scope of the NGJ AoA will include analysis of the ALQ-99 TJS baseline and potential NGJ candidates to be initially integrated onto the EA-18G.  Other potential follow-on candidate platforms that may employ NGJ include F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, various Unmanned Aerial Systems and the B-52.  It should be noted, however, that this AoA ROM cost effort shall not include those additional platforms.  Specifically, the ROM should include the cost of using/ developing, engineering, engagement, mission, campaign and cost modeling and simulation (M&S) tools.  Potential measures of effectiveness metrics to be identified and assessed will include number of strike aircraft lost per cost of electronic attack, time delay for target tracker radar, number and type of radars jammed effectively, targets destroyed, interference on other weapons systems, enemy communications jammed, number and type of ISR assets unable to identify targets, inadvertent communications denied, square miles of regained airspace and cost.  Aircraft integration may drive system performance (i.e. on-aircraft power generation, aircraft computer processing capacity).  Additional attributes likely to affect the analysis effort include protected entity Radio Frequency (RF) signature and industrial base technology limits in the acquisition timeframe.  Likely M&S scenarios for the AoA will include Major Combat Operations (MCOs) using the baseline of 2012 and predicting to 2024.  The AoA must consider classic Strike Warfare employing both low observable and conventional platforms/ munitions.  Analysis in these areas will necessitate multi-level security facilities & cleared personnel to execute the AoA.  Threat environments to be considered must include current and projected Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) threats and communication networks.   Operational concepts to be considered include Carrier Wing (CVW) Strike Warfare (Land), CVW Strike Warfare (ASUW), Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) support, and asymmetric warfare (Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom; non-traditional use of EW spectrum in lower intensity conflict operations).  The AoA will focus on Navy CONOPS however Joint CONOPS will be considered as well.
The NGJ system will be operated by Navy flight officers and maintained by Navy maintenance and operation technicians at possible sites such as Whidbey Island, Cherry Point, or Lemoore NAS.  The system is expected to be fielded incrementally beginning in mid to late 2018.  
The Navy intends to procure this AoA effort on a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract. The Period of Performance for completion of the NGJ AoA is a total of 18 months, of which the first 13 months of the effort will be allowed for AoA planning, baselining, analyzing and completing documentation.  The remaining 5 months are to provide briefing support.
Candidate firms with the capability to support the above efforts are requested to submit the following information electronically to the Government in no more than 6 pages: 
1.	ROM cost to complete the AoA effort.
2.	Previous experience in performing electronic attack analysis for the military.
3.	Experience with engineering, engagement, mission, campaign and cost Modeling and Simulation tools.
4.	Previous experience with multi-level security structures to include facilities management, data processing and personnel eligibility screening.
Please provide feedback on this proposed requirement. All comments or discussions pertaining to improving or enhancing the procurement that industry feels to be necessary should be submitted. This RFI is issued for the purpose of determining market interest, feasibility, and capability of sources. This announcement is not a formal solicitation and does not constitute a request for proposal. Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced under a separate Federal Business Opportunities announcement. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Each response must reference this RFI number: N00019-08-P1-ZA017.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding upon the government. 
The government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this RFI nor will the government compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing information for the government. The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government without written permission in accordance to the legend. 
It is requested that information be submitted within 10 working days after publication posting of this notice. Any request for copies of solicitations will not be addressed since this is a request for information only and is not a request for proposal. 
It is requested that information be submitted to: Trudy Carroll (trudy.carroll@navy.mil; 301-757-7062)

The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), a field activity/inventory control point of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), is hosting a Small Business Networking and Training Conference on December 11, 2007 in Baton Rouge, LA. The purpose of the conference is to enhance small business participation in Federal acquisitions with companies capable of providing energy commodities and services such as; (1) petroleum refineries/terminals in the production of aviation fuels, aviation gasoline, Naval Fuel Distillate (F76), gasohol, gasoline, diesel fuels, heating oils, alternative fuels (biodiesel "B2O", ethanol "E85"); (2) suppliers of natural gas; (3) producers of aerospace fuels to include liquid propellants,
non-propellant cryogens and compressed gases; (4) suppliers of electricity including wind, biomass and geothermal renewable energy, (5) suppliers of coal; and (6) managers of Government Owned Contractor Operated/Contractor Owned Contractor Operated storage terminals and Utility Privatization services.

DESC is also seeking to engage large businesses willing to participate in the Department of Defense Mentor-Protege program by becoming a mentor or provide subcontracting opportunities to small businesses.

The conference will provide an opportunity for you to speak with DESC Small Business Specialists, representatives from several DESC Commodity Business Units (CBUs), Louisiana Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC), and other invited guest speakers. During this all day event we will host training/networking breakout sessions from 1:45 p.m. to 4 p.m. These sessions will provide unique aspects and more in depth details of products and services procured by each CBU.

<DESC>Program Office Identification Number 1007-01QAD Information Due Date: November 5, 2007 Information Due Time: 2 p.m. Eastern Time Responses to this RFI should be directed to: mary.savitsky.ctr@tma.osd.mil REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) INTRODUCTION The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) Resources Information Technology Program Office (RITPO) is contemplating the acquisition of a Patient Safety software solution.   The RITPO develops, operates, and maintains automated information systems to support the  critical business processes of the Department of Defense (D0D) health care systems including manpower and personnel management, provider privileging and credentialing, and medical scheduling and appointing. As an initial step in the procurement process this RFI has been prepared to assist the RITPO in fully understanding the software functionality that is available in the marketplace, the maturity of the product, the market saturation and the supporting techn ology for the product.   This RFI/market survey in being conducted in accordance with the requirements mandated by FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, specifically under the policy set forth in FAR part 12.101.  The procedures for a Market Survey and subsequent review of  t he information obtained as a result of the RFI shall be conducted in accordance with FAR part 10.001, Market Research.   The result of this market research may or may not result in a future requirement for which a request for proposal (RFP) or request f or quote (RFQ) will be advertised.  Submission packages shall be identified and marked with the RFI number listed above.   All submissions shall be submitted no later than 5 November 2007 via e-mail to mary.savitsky.ctr@tma.osd.mil. If your organization currently markets a software system and support services which satisfy the RITPOs requirements for a software solution as briefly outlined in this RFI document then please submit your response to this RFI.  Please make specific refere nce in your response to any legitimately and appropriately confidential or proprietary material contained in the response.  All such information included in the responses to the RFI will be maintained as confidential by the RITPO to the extent permitted by  law.  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 1. Purpose Through this RFI, the RITPO desires to acquire information from vendors regarding software solutions available in the marketplace.  Responses to this RFI will be used to educate the RITPO and the functional user community on the software solutions technolo gy available in the marketplace.  A response to this RFI does not constitute a bid/proposal and if an entity does not respond to this RFI the entity will not be precluded from submitting a bid/proposal to any future RFPs or RFQs. Any information provided i n a response to this RFI may be considered as historical data by the RITPO in the actual RFP process. 2. Background The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2001, Section 733 specified that the Secretary of Defense implement a system of indicators, standards, and protocols necessary to track patient safety. The Department of Defense does not have a process to syst ematically report, compile and analyze errors in the provision of health care under the Defense Health Program.  As a result the DOD established policy (HA POLICY: 03-025, Dec. 10, 2003) for the DOD Patient Safety Program and provided for the involvement and inclusion of the TMA Office of the Chief Medical Officer, the Service Surgeons General, the Army, as Executive Agent for the DoD Patient Safety Center (PSC) located within the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), who would focus on the managemen t and analysis of the Patient Safety Registry/Database, and the Navy as Executive Agent of the Center for Education and Research in Patient Safety within the Uniformed Services University (USU).  Currently the Military Health System (MHS) patient safety reporting processes consis t of both manual and automated approaches and yet there are no uniform processes among the three services or within each service. The reporting process is mostly paper based, although there are some localized Military Treatment Facility (MTF) automation ef forts. There is no effective mechanism to capture and consolidate inpatient and outpatient events and the reporting processes are not seamless or continuous across the MHS.  Data captured in disparate systems and manually does not lend itself to the type o f analysis that permits the review or identification of practices that improve the safe delivery of health care.   DOD recognizes the need to standardize the reporting and management of patient safety events. Implementing the PSR solution requires signific ant changes from current practice as the MHS migrates to electronic reporting and analysis of patient safety data.  A solution must support the collection, reporting, management and storage of event data. The ability to analyze and trend data is critical in supporting all levels of the Patient Safety program throughout DOD, including the PSC (AFIP) and the USU in the DO D patient safety charter.  The solution may include a link to other systems within the enterprise and external to the enterprise, such as systems supporting risk management. Patient Safety data is collected under the protection of US Code, Title 10, § 1102, the confidentiality of me dical quality assurance records. Ideally, the solution must ensure the security of the data through role-based access and optimally de-identify the data in all roll-up and trending to ensure personnel, patients and facilities are not identifiable. A PSR so lution optimally includes an interface to support event reporting by loading patient data, including patient location, into the system. The ability to pull down a patient when reporting an event reduces data entry and provides accurate information for ev ent analysis and investigation. A PSR solution includes a medication error/adverse drug reaction reporting capability, similar to MEDMARX®.  The data follows standardized definitions to support comparisons to data from other peer group organizations, trend analyses, and the development  of best practices.  The ability to analyze, trend and categorize data makes the use of standardized taxonomy optimal when available in the marketplace, and solutions would be capable of mapping their existing classifications to the standard identified b y DOD, e.g. the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The solution would support horizontal and vertical workflow analysis and reporting, provide standard and ad hoc reports to users, and support the preparation of metrics needed to meet the DOD Balanced Scorecard objectives DOD.  Stakeholders include:TMA Office of the Chief Medical Officer (OCMO); The Service Surgeons General; MTF staff; The Uniformed Services University; The Patient Safety Center (AFIP) 3.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-20. This is a Set Aside for Small Business.   The NAICS is 115310.   The small business size standard is 6.5 million. This will be a "best value" procurement with award based on past performance with similar work over the last three years, written work plan indicating precisely how work will be accomplish; and price.  Past performance and work plan when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The statement of work for these services is as follows: BACKGROUND.  One of the primary missions of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) as managers of the Mid-Columbia River National Wildlife Refuge Complex (MCRNWRC) is to protect, manage and restore the native habitats and biodiversity of the Columbia Basin shrub-steppe ecosystem.  To accomplish this mission, it is essential to attempt to replace an over story of native shrubs in areas where shrubs have been eliminated.  Sagebrush, Rabbitbrush, Bitterbrush and other native shrubs are a critical part of habitat for various wildlife species that use the Hanford Reach National Monument.  Upland shrub-steppe habitat restoration has been identified for areas previously impacted by repeated wildland fires and fire suppression activities.  Specifically, impacts to shrub-steppe habitat and shrub plantings related to the suppression of the "Wautoma" fire of August 2007, will be addressed through this scope of work.  Fire management plans provide for the planting of native shrubs (e.g. sagebrush) to replace those lost during fire suppression operations.  T In addition, re-vegetation activities comply with directives established in USFWS - BAER policy for the protection of ecosystem health, threatened and endangered species, and Native American cultural values.   	OBJECTIVES.  To plant approximately 190,000 native shrub (e.g. sagebrush) seedlings within specific upland shrub-steppe habitat restoration sites on the MCRNWRC, Hanford Reach National Monument. 	REQUIREMENTS.  The Contractor shall provide all labor and equipment to perform the restoration planting as described below.  	PRODUCT: Provide planting of 190,000 native shrubs on upland areas of the Monument, as identified by the staff of the MCRNWRC. 	ITEMS FURNISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT:  The U.S. Government will provide: Plant materials, maps of the areas to be planted, marking (flagging) of areas to be planted, plant storage, plant transport, oversight of planting activity and coordination  with other management activities at the MCRNWRC.   1.  Sagebrush Planting. 1.1  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  Provide all labor, tools, equipment and materials to perform all work in strict accordance with the specifications, plans and timing identified in this document. 2.  AREA DESCRIPTION:  Specific upland sites of the Hanford Reach National Monument, in Benton County, Washington.  Staff of the MCRNWRC will identify (flag) specific areas on the ground within these areas.  Approximately 425 acres will be planted, in up to 10 discrete locations. 3.   PLANT MATERIAL;  Plant material will be supplied by the Government.  Plants will meet technical specifications for plant materials, generally plants a minimum of 5 months old, with roots minimum of 15 cm and maximum of 40 cm, and shrub height minimum of 10 cm. 4.  PRINCIPLE ITEMS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED:  Plant approximately 190,000 native shrubs (e.g. sagebrush) seedlings, within specific upland shrub-steppe habitat restoration sites on the MCRNWRC. The following sub-paragraphs identify specific sub-tasks to fulfill the requirements of this project. 4.1  Upon receipt of the notice to proceed, The Contractor shall plant the shrubs by hand using planting shovels to properly place, space, and compact around each shrub as specified.  Notice to proceed shall be based upon sufficient soil moisture, and will be determined by MDRNWRC personnel.  Ultimately, the planting shall be accomplished in such manner as to provide the shrubs the best opportunity for survival (i.e. full soil to root contact, proper planting hole depth and orientation to prevent "J-rooting", proper plant spacing, etc.).  Holes will be large enough and deep enough to insert plant roots without bending or crushing root fibers.  All plant roots will be inserted vertically into the hole, with roots straight to avoid "J" rooting of seedling plants (roots bent at the tip due to shallow hole). Plant roots will be completely surrounded by soil so that no roots are exposed to air. Soil around plant roots will be loose enough so that roots will thrive and grow, yet compacted enough so that there is no air contact to roots.   Attempts will be made to keep any unnecessary soil disturbance to a minimum. Plant materials will consist of approximately 190,000 bare root stock shrubs.  Shrubs shall remain in cold storage until the day they are planted to maintain dormancy.  Any extra plants not planted will be stored in cool, dry location each day.   4.2  Spacing and planting patterns.  The Contractor shall plant the shrubs in several patterns as determined and directed by the staff of the MCRNWRC.  Spacing of the plants shall be on 10-30' foot centers (depending on pattern specified by MCRNWRC staff) and planted in rows, triads, islands, or patches.   Staff from MCRNWRC  will identify specific sites and planting patterns to be used.  Field crew will be instructed on the location, plant spacing, direction of travel, and distance for each plot planted, prior to planting.  The goal of this effort is to re-establish a mosaic of shrub colonies that can provide natural regeneration of larger areas, and to provide specific habitat requirements within these areas.  4.3  Other work as necessary to accomplish the above items. 5.  INTERFACE WITH OTHERS:  Government use of the facilities in this project area is anticipated while the work of this contract is being performed.  The work shall be planned and accomplished so that there will be a minimum of interference and inconvenience to other operations taking place on the Monument.  The Contractor shall coordinate with staff of the MCRNWRC to determine what other operations are scheduled to occur in areas effected by this project and to plan planting efforts in coordination with other management activities on Monument lands. 6.  TECHNICAL ITEMS:   6.1  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION:  All operations performed by The Contractor shall be conducted in compliance with all pertinent federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  The Contractor shall be responsible for disposal of any and all waste products generated while fulfilling this contract (except as specified by MCRNWRC staff).  All packing materials shall be recycled at local area recycling station when possible.  All other wastes shall be disposed of by The Contractor at off site location.  Contractor shall utilize existing roads to access planting areas, and shall utilize existing staging areas in the field. 6.2  PROJECT AREA: Arid Lands Ecology Reserve, Rattlesnake Mountain, Hanford Reach National Monument, Benton County, Washington. 6.3	QUALIFICATIONS:  Personnel involved with the execution of this contract shall be experienced and qualified in the type of work required.  Contractor shall provide a written work plan summary, with contract bid, including how they will accomplish the project.  Work plan should be concise. 7.  TIMING: 7.1  Timing of this shrub planting project shall be between 26 November 2007 and 31 January 2008. Planting dates will be determined by staff of MCRNWRC.  Soil moisture must be greater than 10% prior to planting.  There must be some precipitation before and some predicted following the planting dates.  Upon issue of notice to proceed, the Contractor shall have 2 days to mobilize and begin planting of the shrubs. The Contractor shall complete planting within 20 calendar days after given the notice to proceed.  This narrow window of performance is required to take advantage of optimum soil moisture opportunities and to ensure that shrubs retain their integrity.   This performance window is subject to potential weather conditions that may prevent planting (i.e. frozen ground).  The performance window may be modified based on weather conditions in coordination with, and with approval of, Monument staff. 7.2  It is anticipated that the Contractor will have to plant approximately 9,500 shrubs per day in order to meet the timeline proposed.  Contractor would be well advised to consider the appropriate labor requirements to meet the 20-day performance window.  Additionally, daylight hours during November and December are limited (sunrise at approximately 07:30 am and sunset at approximately 16:15).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.           It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.           Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.           Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).     Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Point of Contact for all information regarding this acquisition is Linda Townsel, Contract Specialist, at the address and phone number listed below.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No telephone requests or written requests for the solicitation will be accepted.  DEPARTMENT  OF JUSTICE, FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION, Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subparts 6.302-1(a)(1) and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(a), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competition procedures is justified for this procurement action.  The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2 (Content).  The BOP, Office of Information Systems has a requirement for the annual maintenance renewal of 1,196 software licenses for the Stedman?s Plus Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker Premium ASCII Edition Software, and the acquisition of 2,240 additional licenses.  The Medical Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker Software is utilized and incorporated with the BOP?s existing Electronic Medical Records (EMR) System.  The BOP requires the Stedman Pharmaceutical Software for use with the EMR system currently in use by the agency.  The software maintenance services licenses and additional new users include: all new software releases; system update; program temporary fixes (PTFs); documentation updates; and toll-free hot-line support twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week for system software assistance.  The estimated value of this acquisition is estimated at $55,734.64.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, it is determined that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - (1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  The BOP requires the renewal for software maintenance and acquisition of additional licenses for the Stedman Plus Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker software for the EMR system.  The software will be part of the current system.  In addition, the EMR system is a rights protected system, and the EMR software vendor utilizes the Stedman software as the spell-check feature on the pharmacy module.  The Stedman vendor, Wolter Kluwer Health, Inc., owns the proprietary rights for the Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker software and has not authorized this product to be offered for resale by other vendors.  Due to Wolter Kluwer Health, Inc.?s, owning the proprietary rights to the Stedman?s Plus Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker software and that the product has not been authorized for resale by other vendors, no further efforts to obtain competition were made.  A review of the proposed price was completed by the Contracting Officer.  Based on the submittal from the vendor and a comparison of current and historical acquisition data for similar maintenance renewals and acquisitions of software licenses, it was determined that the quote was based on established market pricing and is acceptable to the Government.  The Contracting Officer has made the determination that proposed price is fair and reasonable.  In accordance with FAR 10.001, Market Research was conducted by both the requiring activity and the Contracting Officer.  It has been determined that to not maintain the spell-check software and maintenance service for this system would be detrimental to the BOP, as the pharmacy systems controls and directs the types and amounts of medication being dispensed to the inmates.  The BOP also requires additional licenses for deployment to the BOP medical offices, and to obtain software different from the current software would be detrimental to the overall operation of the BOP EMR system.  The BOP will continue to conduct market surveys and make efforts to obtain competition for future acquisitions.  Contracting Officer Certification-  I hereby certify that this request for Limited Source Justification is made in good faith, and that the supporting justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.   //s// Linda Townsel, Contract Specialist; National Acquisitions Section.  Approval://s// Jan R. Johns, Chief, National Acquisitions Section.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation with additional information included in this notice. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) is a law enforcement organization within the United States Department of Justice with unique responsibilities dedicated to reducing violent crime and protecting the public. In 2002, ATF implemented a new promotion plan for its Grade 14 and 15, 1811 special agents. The plan includes a Promotion Assessment Center (AC) for each grade level. Bureau managers and senior supervisors (known as subject matter experts or SMEs) facilitated by an outside contractor Human Resources Research Organization (HumRRO) of Alexandria, VA) design the Assessment Center exercises. HumRRO also trains the assessors, administers and scores the testing, and provides a statistical analysis of the results.

ATF generally holds one Assessment Center a year, alternating between the grade 14 and 15 Assessment Centers. In addition, each year the Bureau rewrites all of the exercises for one of the Assessment Centers. For example, in a year when the Bureau conducts a grade 14 Assessment Center, the exercises for the grade 15 Assessment Center are being rewritten and vice versa. The Human Resources Division, Office of Management is responsible for overseeing the Assessment Center Program. This includes hiring and monitoring the performance of a contractor with expertise in the development and running of Assessment Centers to assist in coordinating the design and administration of the Bureau's Assessment Centers, including the coordination of assessor training, Assessment Center administrative material that goes to Assessment Center participants, reviewing and coordinating Assessment Center schedules, and assisting with on-site administration at all Assessment Centers.
