<CONTACT>Sharon L. Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-427-1781, Email sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is planning on awarding on a sole-source basis to the RAND Corporation a contract to develop and test a Health Literacy supplemental module to the Hospital CAHPS® Survey (CAHPS = Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems).  It is necessary to award this contract to one of the CAHPS grantees (RAND Corporation or Yale University) due to their previous experience with the CAHPS approach to instrument testing and development.  RAND is chosen for this sole source contract because of their previous experience in developing a CAHPS Health Literacy module for the C/G CAHPS Survey.  This module is scheduled for field testing in 2008.  This contract will be to develop a supplement to that survey.  In addition, since the beginning of the project in 1995, RAND has assumed responsibility for developing and testing all Spanish language CAHPS tools.  RAND is the overall lead on work done in the area of cultural competence in CAHPS and has led the development of Health Literacy CAHPS (HCAHPS).  The continued RAND leadership into this new contract will result in a high quality end product achieved with efficient use of resources.  The proper completion of this contract shall require:  the development of a draft survey, in English and in Spanish; obtaining feedback about the survey from stakeholders; conducting cognitive and field testing; and developing a dissemination strategy.  It is important that the development of the HCAHPS module follows the developmental process of other CAHPS instruments.  AHRQ intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested organizations capable of performing the above with the requisite qualifications and expertise should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirements.  Sources shall have understanding and in-depth experience in the development of CAHPS instruments that encompass the processes surrounding:  (1) the development of an initial draft, (2) Spanish translation, (3) a stakeholders meeting, (4) the preparation of cognitive testing, (5) the recruitment of field testing sites, (6) cognitive testing, (7) the preparation of field testing protocol, (8) field testing, (9) statistical analysis of the results.  Sources shall demonstrate experience developing CAHPS instruments.  Sources shall also demonstrate experience developing instruments in the field of Health Literacy.  Sources shall have experience in evaluating outcomes of each phase of the Health Literacy module development evident by providing analytical reports after completing cognitive and field testing.  Sources must also possess, or be able to obtain (in-house or through subcontracting arrangements), the staff and other resources needed to expeditiously carry out the different types of activities listed above.  Capability statements are due no later than April 25, 2008.  No solicitation is currently available.  Capability statements should be submitted electronically to Sharon Williams at Sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov or paper copies (original and two copies) to Sharon Williams, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD  20850.  Capability statements should be no more than 10 pages long and may include attachments such as resumes in addition to the 10 page limit.  Capability statements received after April 25, 2008 will not be reviewed.  Organizations should include their DUNS number and indicate the size of the company (i.e., large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone, etc.).  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement or a sole source procurement.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh PA. hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Chamber Corp.; Plank Overcast Roof System, 2 - Self Closing Airlock Mine Duty Doors and 2-Mine Duty Access Doors delivered to Lake Lynn Lab Experimental Mine Facility, Fairchance, PA. The CDC/NIOSH/MSHA specifications require equipment that must match/incorporate/retrofit into the existing system that is installed at the fire suppression facility.
<p>Based upon its market research, CDC/NIOSH/MSHA is unaware of any other compatible products that meet the technical requirements and specifications of this procurement:<br />1) The Roof System; must meet the following specifications: cover 145' of roof span, 2.5'x 6.5" corrugated 20' long planks (part of the roof length will go from 20' to 12' over a 35' span). ASTM A 446 grade C Zinc coating per ASTM 25, 50KSI max load, 40PSF snow load, predrilled for fasteners, cadmium fasteners, formed angles for T junction, performed end gage pressure at 18' span and mine duty.<br />2) Mine Duty Airlock Doors-2; self closing, fits 18' x 7' opening, removal center post, frame 8" C channel, 1/8" thick steel with 4" channel stiffeners, mine duty, 15" water gauge at 18", 8"x10" opening for sliding window, 8"x10"x1/8" sliding break air seal plate.<br />3) Mine Duty Access Doors-2; 42"x72" 8" C channel frame, 1/8" thick steel with 4" channel stiffeners, 15" water gauge.</p>
<p>The roofing system and doors will be able to handle high temperature conveyor belt fires without losing any structural properties and posing harm to any researchers involved in the experiments. The system will also support the weight of snow which accumulates heavily in this area. This is a flat roof system that mimics underground mine roofs. The design of the roof will also support the weight of researchers who will be placing instrumentation on and through the roof. This configuration is necessary to accomplish the stated objectives on determining the effects of ventilation on fire suppression systems on a conveyor belt system. The existing system has successfully been in use for over 15 years at the Lake Lynn facility.<br /><br />This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to Chamber Corp, under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to James Ambrozic, Purchasing Agent, Assistance Field Branch (Pittsburgh), PO Box 18070, Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0070; email eud7@cdc.gov. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Chamber Corp, 2559 Brant School Road. Suite 200, Wexford, PA 15090, as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<a href="mailto:Cynthia.M.Garcia@nasa.gov">Cynthia  Garcia</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) has a requirement for continuing servicescurrently provided by Lockheed Martin Mission Services (LMMS) under the Space ShuttleLanding and Research Aircraft Support Services Contract (SSLRASS). The primaryrequirement is to provide management and technical personnel to operate, maintain andrepair Space Shuttle landing aids and communications equipment prior to launch, duringspecified on orbit space flight operations and during Shuttle landings at Edwards.  NASA/DFRC intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price/Indefinite Delivery and IndefiniteQuantity/Cost-plus-no fee contract for 18 months with two (2) six-month options to LMMSfor these services. The period of performance should provide coverage through the end ofProgram life and Program shutdown. The Space Shuttle Program anticipates retiring thefleet and shutdown of the Program in approximately 2010. The options provide flexibilityto allow the Program to continue to meet its needs, should retirement and shutdown extendbeyond the current estimate. The statutory authority for proceeding with this acquisition using Other Than Full andOpen Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as contemplated by the provision of FAR6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). This provision states that full and open competition need not beprovided for when the services required by the agency are available from only theoriginal source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highlyspecialized services. The provision also states that this exception is applicable when itis likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costto the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or therewould be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. The Space Shuttle Program (SSP) Management has initiated an action plan that will fasttrack completion of the International Space Station, by launching 11 Space Shuttlemissions between now and the September 2010 shuttle retirement. To safely complete theseSpace Shuttle Missions, all contractual elements associated with the program will berequired to perform their missions flawlessly and without delays.  The schedule marginthat would be required for a competitive selection and potentially incorporating a newprime contractor into the Program would not support the ISS assembly schedule.Competition of the Space Shuttle operations requirements could lead to the loss ofknowledgeable personnel introducing unacceptable risk to the SSP.  In addition, becauseof the transition time required and associated disruption of the Space Shuttle operationsservices, there is a potential for increased safety risks to the orbiter and crew. Because of these considerations, including the unacceptable costs and delays that wouldbe incurred to conduct a competition and/or select a different prime contractor, thepotential benefits from competition do not justify accepting these substantial risks tothe Shuttle and ISS programs. In conclusion, LMMS is the only firm believed to be capableof fulfilling the proposed requirements.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to performthe effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. localtime on April 30, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely forthe purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitivebasis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a fulland open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within thediscretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>In accordance with FAA Acquisition Policy 3.2.2.4 and AMS Procurement Guidance T3.2.2.4.A.3,  the Department of Transportation (DOT),  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Air Traffic Organization - EnRoute (ATO-E) is issuing this public announcement to inform industry of the intention of the FAA ATO-E to extend current Second-Level Maintenance activities for the Host Computer System (HCS) on a single-source basis, with Lockheed Martin Transportation and Security Solutions (LMTSS) under existing contract DTFA01-97-C-00039.
The HCS is being replaced by the En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) system.  The current JRC waterfall schedule for full ERAM deployment and replacement of HCS is to be completed by 12/31/2010.  However, issues involving the Offshore Flight Data Processing System (OFDPS) at the Honolulu Control Facility (HCF), IBM hardware architecture, and general risk mitigation planning in case of ERAM waterfall deployment slippage, have increased the probability of the HCS being a viable FAA system after the current ERAM waterfall schedule date.  Therefore a five (5) year extension that includes five (5) one (1) year option periods, to 9/30/2013 is contemplated.
The Host Computer System (HCS) is the cornerstone of the National Airspace System (NAS), and its criticality to the NAS demands continuous and safe operation without disruption.  The objective of the current Host Sustainment contract is to ensure continued software and hardware maintenance support for all HCS equipment located at the Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC's), at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center (Technical Center), the FAA Aeronautical Center (FAAAC) and the hardware support required for the Offshore Flight Data Processing System (OFDPS) at the Honolulu Control Facility (HCF).
The following rationale is hereby given to support a single source extension of Host maintenance to Lockheed Martin Corporation under the current Host Sustainment Contract, DTFA01-97-C-00039:
	LMTSS has been the prime contractor maintaining the HCS since 1997.  Before that, IBM maintained the Host system (using IBM hardware architecture and equipment).  The business unit that IBM used to maintain Host was purchased by Loral Corporation which in turn was purchased by Lockheed Martin Corporation.  The current contractor workforce maintaining Host consists of workers originally employed by both IBM and Loral before moving on to Lockheed Martin.  The average experience level of the current contractor support group for Host is 15+ years.  No other company can come close to the experience level required to maintain the Host Computer System.	The current LMTSS (and subcontractors) contractor support staff would not be willing to work for another contractor to support the HCS with only three (3) to five (5) years remaining until HCS ceases to be a functioning FAA NAS system.	LMTSS is the prime contractor for development and maintenance of the new ERAM system.  Many current Host contractor support staff employed by LMTSS are cross training on the new ERAM system.  Therefore, these support contractors can easily migrate back to Host support when needed.  The experienced Host contractors have no reason to find employment with another contractor to maintain Host.  Many have support functions already with ERAM after it replaces the HCS.	There are no current introductory training courses for Host for new personnel to learn the Host system architecture.  Even if there were, the training lasts 5-6 months with additional supervised on the job training of six (6) months to one (1) year in length.  The cost to train and "ramp up" new Host hires would require unnecessary time and expense for a legacy FAA NAS system that will be replaced within three (3) to five (5) years (after award of the extension).	HCS hardware architecture consists of IBM equipment.  LMTSS has embedded IBM in its parts inventory control system as a subcontractor to maintain Host hardware.  IBM personnel are the only contractors that can maintain Host hardware and provide replacement parts for Host equipment (including OFDPS).	The HCS is an FAA En Route legacy system with a current remaining life as a NAS system of three (3) to five (5) years.  The current period of performance for Host maintenance supplied by Lockheed Martin Corporation ends 9/30/2008.  Any new contractor hired to maintain the system would require extensive training, familiarization, and expense.  The current skilled workforce would be unwilling to work for another company to maintain Host (as delineated above), therefore, any new company hired to maintain the HCS would be providing inexperienced labor as a majority of its workforce.  The HCS is a critical part of the NAS and any disruption has the potential to be catastrophic in nature.  The risk of disruption due to inexperienced labor maintaining the HCS is too great to warrant competition for this effort.
The impact on the Host, as delineated above, would be greatly increased risk of Host software and hardware failures and greatly increased risk of these failures having negative impact on the NAS.  The HOST Computer System (HCS) is a critical part of the NAS Air Traffic Control System. HCS processes critical radar and flight management data, provides communication support and generates display data used by air traffic controllers.  It is imperative that system problems be resolved immediately.  Reduction of NAS experience and skill level of the contractors maintaining the HCS system would increase the amount of time to resolve issues.  Reduced responsiveness to system problems and failures would result in increase length of system outages and increase number of flight delays.  Delays and outages directly impact the safe and efficient operation of air commerce in the United States.   It is not in the FAA's best interest from both a cost and risk mitigation standpoint to have another contractor maintain the HCS until the transition to ERAM is complete.
All inquires or questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to the Contracting Officer, Mary Dobbs, at email address Mary.Dobbs@faa.gov.

<DESC>This is a PRESOLICITATION NOTICE to announce the anticipated release of the solicitation for the Information and Computing Technologies for the 21st Century (ICT21) Program, on or about May 1st, 2008.  

The purpose of the ICT21 contract is to acquire information technology support, goods, and services for the ICT21 Program.  The ICT21 Program shall provide an Agency-wide computing platform for the 21st century that is efficient, effective, scalable, flexible, and reliable that meets the FDA business requirements and enhances the capabilities of FDA’s IT environment, including: technology refreshment plan, increased consistency and standardization, movement toward providing infrastructure as a utility service, develop and implement new standard operational procedures and processes, and people skill-set development and training.  The successful delivery of these objectives will enable the FDA to provision an infrastructure that is capable of meeting the business requirements while improving service, response times, and overall performance. 

FDA recognizes that no single contractor may be capable of providing the full range of goods and services called for under this contract. Therefore, FDA encourages, where appropriate, the teaming of contractors and vendors with strong domain expertise under a single ICT21 Contractor.

Pursuant to FAR Parts 15 & 16.5, FDA anticipates the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to support the ICT21 Program.  The Contracting Officer has determined that a portion of the acquisition shall be set-aside for small business in accordance with FAR 19.502-3.  FDA intends to implement a partial small business set aside by pursuing a two-tiered approach.  Under a two-tiered approach, the first tier would consist of approximately three awards to large businesses, with the second tier consisting of approximately six small businesses.  With each new request for task order proposal, first consideration would be to specifically set aside the requirement for small business, given the ability of small businesses to perform the work, which would greatly depend on the scope, size, and complexity of the task and the specialized capabilities of the pool of small business awardees.  Small businesses would have full opportunity to propose on all tasks, unless one of the exceptions to Fair Opportunity applies.

The solicitation will be made available on www.fbo.gov.  

Questions or comments must be submitted IN WRITING to Sherry Solodkova at sherry.solodkova@fda.hhs.gov and Janet Herman at janet.herman@fda.hhs.gov.  Phone calls will not be accepted.

Thank you for your interest in the ICT21 Program.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Chequamegon Nicolet National Forest is soliciting for culvert replacement along FR1417 located in the town of Grover, Taylor County, Wisconsin.  Culverts will be sized to pass the estimated 100-year flood.  New culverts will be installed at an elevation that will allow fish passage and conform to channel characteristics.  Culverts will have a bevel on both ends that will conform to the slope and will be less likely to become plugged by ice, woody debris or beaver.  Fill around the culvert will be compacted to prevent settling, piping of water and culvert failure.  Where necessary, culverts will be skewed to match the natural stream pattern.  At crossings with substantial stream flow, water will be temporarily diverted around the culvert site during construction to minimize sedimentation.  Silt fence will be utilized until permanent erosion control measures are in effect.  Erosion control measures will be used to minimize sedimentation.  These will include seeding to ensure re-vegetation and development of permanent ground cover; placement of erosion control mats on cut and fill slopes to protect bare soil surface from erosion and ensure adequate re-vegetation; placement of rock riprap at the inlet and outlet to prevent scour; placement of gravel and crowning of the road where needed.  The project completion date is September 15, 2008.  The project is estimated between $125,000 and $175,000.  Offer guarantee, performance and payment bonds, CCR, and ORCA are required.  This will be a hub-zone small business set-aside best value award.  All solicitation documents will be posted at FBO.

<DESC>The National Data Buoy Center intends to negotiate only with Paroscientific of Redmond, WA for 16 each, Model 410K-101 Pressure Transducers, P/N 1223-001, SCN # 7271-001. 
The Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) program is a scientific research program developed several years ago by the NOAA Office of Atmospheric Research (OAR) at their Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) facility. The current DART program consists of a network of 44 small buoys having bottom pressure sensors on the ocean floor that provide early reporting and warning of tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean and in other oceans.   All of the DART electrical, mechanical, and electronic equipment currently used in the DART program and on DART buoys is the result of custom engineering design and fabrication accomplished by PMEL directly, or through sole-source contractors, and much of it is proprietary. During the design process, PMEL integrated several custom manufactured electronics assemblies into the electronic sensor and data acquisition system used on the DART buoys. The buoy electronic assembly is the DART Acoustic Modem/CPU Assembly, which PMEL built, and which consists of several proprietary, custom designed printed circuit boards for controlling the Acoustic Modem/Acoustic Release sensor suite. Three Dart Benthos Acoustic Modem/CPU Assemblies and one Paroscientific Bottom Pressure Transducer are used on every DART buoy in the present PMEL designed configuration. Two of the Modem/CPU assemblies are used in the Dart buoy hull, one for primary data acquisition, and one as a secondary system in case of failure of the primary unit; the third is used in the Bottom Pressure Sensor suite.. There are also other custom designed peripheral equipment integral to the operation of the DART buoy, including two Benthos Acoustic Modem Transducers used for wireless acoustic signal communications with the bottom pressure sensor equipment suite, an EdgeTech Acoustic release Module which can be used to release the the Bottom Pressure Sensor suite from the mooring for recovery.  Additionally, there is a locally fabricated DART GOES Transmitter Assembly for transmitting the pressure data messages through the GOES satellite uplink, and an externally mounted RF Modem Assembly used for line-of-sight data recovery.  The Bottom Pressure Sensor suite of equipment which includes the third DART Acoustic Modem/CPU Assembly, also contains a very special Paroscientific pressure transducer as the ocean floor or seabed sensor. This is one of the most critical parts of the system because the pressure transducer sits on the ocean floor and sends pressure data back to the electronics data acquisition units on the buoy via acoustic modems, and changes in the pressure data is the first sign of an approaching tsunami. PMEL selected the Paroscientific Model 410K-101 for use as the DART Bottom Pressure Sensor and it is now integral to the design; no other known sensor meets the design requirements, and Paroscientific is the only vendor who can supply these subassemblies because they are proprietary to the company.

All offers shall be evaluated for fair and reasonable price, technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance, delivery schedule and adherence to the applicable clauses/provisions.  Notice to Offerers:  This procurement is part of the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System RED/Yellow/Green Program.  Award will be based on the contracting officer's decision as to which offer provides the best value to the Navy, price, past performance, and other factors considered.
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).  
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f! irst article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>On or about May 30, 2008, the U. S. Geological Survey, National Information Earthquake Center (NEIC) will release a competitive solicitation, number 08CRSS0018, for the design, installation, and maintenance of a robust, secure, two-way wireless technology communications system. This system will utilize satellite or other wireless technology for communication with remote and unstaffed ground motion monitoring stations distributed throughout the contiguous United States and Alaska. This system will transmit continuous data collected from these remote stations to the NEIC hub in Golden, Colorado, in near real-time for the purpose of earthquake detection and notification.  The system will also carry software downloads and commands back to the remote stations for the purpose of equipment maintenance and monitoring.  This communications system will be a critical component of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) project, involving USGS mission-critical earthquake monitoring with public safety implications.  This communications system will replace a current operating system using satellite technology.  The USGS is willing to entertain a variety of designs and solutions that meet minimum operating standards and functional requirements, as defined in the solicitation.  It is desirable for the system to include the ability to access a back-up hub location in the event of catastrophic failure of the primary hub.  USGS ownership of the equipment and the system will be considered, but is not required.  Contractor's proposal will include all communication and network elements such as (1) technology to be utilized (including information on satellites used if this is the proposed solution), (2) communication ground devices to be installed, which will replace the 75 currently operating seismograph stations (for example, bidirectional very small aperture satellite terminals (VSATs) or equivalent), (3) network design, including a redundant backhaul method, if available, (4) any catastrophic backup hub, (5) bandwidth capabilities, (6) installation plan involving USGS personnel, (7) transition plan from the currently operating equipment to the new network and ground stations, and (6) a plan for on-going operation support and maintenance of the system.  Equipment and services will be for a base year and four option years. The solicitation will be unrestricted under NAICS codes 517410 entitled "Satellite Telecommunications" which has a size standard of $13.5 million.  A complete statement of work and source selection criteria will be included in the solicitation.  Written response will be due within 30 days of the issue date.  Interested parties may access a copy or download the documents by going to http://ideasec.nbc.gov .  Telephone requests for a hard copy of the solicitation will not be accepted.  Interested parties must be registered in CCR (Central Contractor Registration), http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for contract award.  In the interim, questions or concerns may be directed to the Contract Specialist, Cheryl Flanagan, at (303) 236-9323 or cflanagan@usgs.gov .  See note 26.

<DESC>1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  One firm will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See government-wide numbered note(s) 24.  A-E services are required to provide the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of complete Civil and Military works projects.  Projects will primarily be located within the South Pacific Division’s military boundaries of CA, NV, UT and AZ and the civil works boundaries of CA, NV, AZ, UT, and portions of OR, ID, CO and WY.  The contracts may also be used by other Districts within South Pacific Division (Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Albuquerque Districts) to encompass the entire South Pacific Division geographical area of responsibility.  Use of the contracts outside the above areas of responsibility is subject to the review and approval of the contracting officer. This work will include all Architectural-Engineering (A-E) and related services necessary to complete the assigned task orders for studies and designs. A specific scope of work and services will be issued with each task order.  This procurement will be conducted under FSC Code: C219; SIC Code: 8712; and North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS): 541310.  The size standard for this code is $4,500,000.  To be considered a Small Business under this NAICS Code, the respondent’s average revenue for the last three fiscal years cannot be more than $4,500,000.  This announcement is unrestricted and open to all firms regardless of size.  The contract will be negotiated and awarded within one year after the required response date to this announcement.  A Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be negotiated and is anticipated to be awarded in August 2008.  The contract will be for a maximum of a one-year base period from the date of award and will contain options to extend 4 additional one-year periods.  The contract amount for the base period and any option will not exceed $1,960,000 for each period.  The total contract amount shall not exceed $9,800,000.  Individual task orders shall not exceed the annual contract amount.  The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  At the discretion of the Government, the option years may be exercised early if the Total Estimated Price is exhausted or nearly exhausted.  If the option is exercised prior to the one-year anniversary of the contract award date, or the anniversary of exercising an option, the new option year rates will take effect on the anniversary date of the contract period.  If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that year’s 12-month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimated Price of the option period being exercised.  At the discretion of the Government, if an option year is exercised early and unused capacity is rolled over, the Government may extend the period of service to coincide with the anniversary date of that period.  The minimum guarantee for the base year of the contract will be $392,000.  All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance with the provisions of FAR Sections 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, with small and small disadvantaged business.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be a least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employees office location (not the location of the work).  If a large business is selected for this contract, it will be required to submit a detailed Small Business Subcontracting Plan with the fee proposal when it is submitted by the firm selected for negotiations.  A detailed plan is not required to be submitted with the SF 330, however, the plans to do so should be specified in block H of the SF 330.  Sacramento District’s recommended goal for work intended to be subcontracted is 70.0% for small business.  The goal further states that of the 70.0% to be subcontracted to small business, 6.2% is for Small Disadvantaged Business (subset to small business), 7.0% is for Small Business/Woman Owned (subset to small business), 9.8% is for HUBZone Small Business (subset to small business). 3.0% is for Veteran-Owned Small Business (subset to small business) and 0.9% is for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small business (subset to small business).  If the selected firm submits a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale of why the above goals are not met.  Firms should indicate personnel and subcontractors selected to work on the contract and state their management structure.  To be eligible for contract award a firm or joint venture must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the Internet Site at http://www.bpn.gov /CCRINQ or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414 and complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Contractor Performance Evaluations:  In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractor’s performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedures outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement.  For A-E contracts awarded at or above $30,000,000, the USACE will evaluate contractor’s performance and prepare a performance report using the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), which is now a web-based system. After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days.  Accessing and using ACASS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the users computer. The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transactions.  The certification software could cost approximately $110 - $125 per certificate per year and is purchased from an External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendor.  Current information about the PKI certification process and for contacting vendors can be found on the web site at http://www.cpars.navy.mil/.  If the Contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to CCASS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.  The Secretary of the Army’s Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) requirement will be incorporated into this contract.  The annual CMR requirement will apply to each task order which is funded by Army dollars; supports an Army mission; which benefits or supports any Army military, civilian, or contractor personnel; or when the Army is the executive agency for the mission being supported.  The A-E will be allowed to include their costs for compliance with the CMR requirement as a line item in their price proposal for each task order subject to the CMR requirement.  Further information is available at https://cmra.army.mil.

<DESC>Government Request for Information
THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS ISSUED AS MARKET RESEARCH.  ALL REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED IN THIS RFI ARE TENTATIVE AND WILL BE FINALIZED PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  The information provided is entirely voluntary and will not impact the ability to bid on future requirements.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), a request for proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.

The information you provide may be utilized by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in developing its acquisition strategy and its Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives and Performance Specifications.  The information resulting from this RFI may be included in one or more solicitation, which will be released to industry.  Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights.  However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, it is to be marked appropriately.

This is an unclassified RFI open to US Department of Defense (DoD) propulsion contractors and DoD propulsion subcontractors only.  Prime foreign company participation is excluded.  Additionally, a resulting future acquisition will involve data that are unclassified but are subject to export control laws and regulations.  Only propulsion contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be provided copies of the resulting solicitation or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions when the solicitation is issued.  Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-800-353-3572) for further information on the certification process.  You must submit a copy or AFRL must have a copy on file of your approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the solicitation.

All replies [to this RFI] are to be provided to the USAF within thirty (30) days after release of this RFI, on 16 May 2007 by 4:00 p.m. PST.


Program Description
The Air Force is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only to allow potential propulsion contractors to submit questions, comments and suggestions prior to the potential release of a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).

The purpose of this RFI is to obtain contractor input to enable AFRL to define the best approach for an innovative Engine Health Management (EHM) program in support of Hydrocarbon Boost.  This approach should intend to meet the AF vision goal of a decrease in turn around time of a booster engine to 8 hours.  The EHM system should adhere to AFRL’s Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) architecture interface control document (ICD).  The ICD will be made available to qualified interested parties.  AFRL is interested in technical concepts and program approaches that will insure program success while meeting these operationally responsive metrics.  Categories of responses include, but are not limited to sensors, signal processing, and software.  Of particular interest are concepts which develop new or novel approaches that help achieve the AF vision goal.  Technologies must also be able to undergo subscale or rig testing.

The contract type to be awarded for the program is not yet determined.  It is anticipated that the solicitation(s) will result in the award of one or more cost-share/cost-plus/cost-reimbursement type contract(s).  Funding for a contract or multiple contracts is less than ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00), and the program can be up to 4 years in duration from authority to proceed (ATP).


Questions 
In order for the government to adequately assess and improve the requirements for solicitation and the resulting contracted program/programs, candidate contractors are encouraged to provide responses to the following questions.  Answers to these questions should be in addition to other contractor comments and suggestions provided.

<DESC>F-15C Mission Training Center (MTC) Follow-on Services SourcesSought Notice
DescriptionI. Request for Information (RFI) for Planning Purposes.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997).
a)  The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide training services for F-15C Mission Training Centers (MTC) following the end of the existing MTC services contract in November 2012. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.b)  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.
c)  Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.
d)  Background:  The Combat Air Forces (CAF) Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) program is utilizing training simulation services at ACC, PACAF, and USAFE main operating bases for F-15C, F-15E, F-16 Block 50, and AWACS platforms, with interoperability between sites provided via the DMO Network (DMON). The F-15C MTC Integrated Product Team at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is responsible for fielding aircrew training device capability that ensures the trainers maintain concurrency with the aircraft co-located at each base. Currently this capability is provided through a commercial training simulation services contract that meets the Air Force requirements. This contract is programmed to end on 2 November 2012.  The Air Force wishes to continue with a simulation services contract on the F-15C MTCs at no less than one (1) location and no more than five (5) locations that may include two (2) USAF CONUS bases, two (2) PACAF bases, and one (1) USAFE base. Contractors will be responsible for maintaining their simulation services concurrent with changes to aircraft and weapons operating at the respective locations.  Each F-15C site will connect into the DMON via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and will have to meet the CAF DMO Interoperability Standards (described at http://www.dmodmt.com). An associate contract agreement with NGMS and other simulator manufacturers will be required in support of DMO integration.
e)  The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15, non-personal services contract with a total delivery period of no fewer than three (3) years and no more than ten (10) years (three year base period with seven one year options).
f)  All services will be housed in Government facilities and utilized by personnel designated by the government. Government-contracted instructors, separate from this acquisition, will use all aspects of the services in preparation for and conduct of lessons.
g)  Payment for training services under this contract will commence with start of service at each site.
h)  The purpose of this RFI is to determine offeror interest in providing F-15C MTC simulation services to the Air Force.
II. Program Requirements:
a)	The F-15C MTC System will be a high-fidelity simulation system that facilitates F 15C personnel training.  This will include maintenance personnel engine run training and pilot training at all levels, ranging from individual events in a single-ship mode of operation to large-scale, theater specific, composite force combat mission training and rehearsal in a distributed mission operation training environment.
b)	The F-15C MTC will be an integrated set of hardware and software that will implement the performance requirements specified in a requirements document that this organization will provide in the request for proposal (RFP). The MTC will be required to support basic and advanced mission training, tactics development, theater exercise support in both local and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) environments, and possibly operational test and evaluation, for all active duty F 15C aircraft employment capabilities.
c)	Each F-15C MTC will include either two (2) or four (4) mission simulators, with a grand total of no more than 18 cockpits in service. Each Mission Simulator must be concurrent with the fielded aircraft baseline and capable of single-ship, local multi-ship, combat theater missions, and DMO training and mission operations. Each MTC will include computer generated force simulation, scenario generation capability, instructor-operator stations, and brief-debrief systems.  Specific performance requirements for all system elements will be defined in the requirements documents, but will be similar to the following requirements for the existing system:
1)	Cockpits.  The simulator system cockpits must be a high-fidelity representation of the F-15C aircraft, including controls, displays, avionics, and aerodynamic flight modeling representative of the F-15C aircraft. The system shall provide realistic simulation of F-15C handling characteristics for all normal ground and flight regimes. The system must be equipped with a full field-of-view visual display, digital image generation system for visual, night vision imaging system, joint helmet mounted cueing system (JHMCS), and radar data base. The four cockpits will be designed for networked training scenarios of one or more participants and in addition allow for stand-alone, solo pilot training. Cockpit hardware and software will be modular and an open architecture design to allow for flexibility for upgrades and incorporation of new hardware/ software technology.
2)	Synthetic Environment.  The simulator will create a realistic, high fidelity environment capable of supporting a full range of mission scenarios.  It will support a mix of constructive and interactive entities that react to aircraft flight maneuvers, avionics, weapons systems, and atmospheric conditions.  It will accurately model physical, electronic, and aerodynamic capabilities of real world threats.  It will also accurately model and integrate the impact of aircraft countermeasures (i.e., chaff, flares, jamming, anti-radar maneuvers, etc.).  It will realistically model electronic combat entities and their effects. Constructive entities will include blue, gray, and red air entities as well as ground based threats.  Threats will operate under a realistic, dynamic command and control structure. The system will provide aerodynamic and visual simulation of aircraft battle damage.
3)	Instructor Operator Station (IOS).  The IOS will provide the instructor the ability to monitor the simulation, all displays, and instrument indications of each cockpit independently or all four interconnected cockpits.  The system will also provide the capability to set up and run one or more independent simultaneous missions.  It will also include the ability to simultaneously operate local and long-haul network devices and monitor all missions. This system must be capable of managing a DMO mission environment. The IOS will be capable of controlling and inputting threats, emergency procedures (EPs), instrument indications, and weapons hit/miss data. The IOS must provide means for generation, setup, monitoring, and evaluating simulated training scenarios and missions. These scenarios can be changed or modified by the instructors at any time during the mission via the IOS.  The capability to share scenarios and missions between networked sites must be provided. The IOS will give the instructor the capability to insert specific or dynamically created situations into the simulation. This includes EPs, threats, instrument indications, weapon hit/miss data, and other mission events. The IOS will be capable of freezing/resetting individual or all four cockpits scenarios independently. The IOS must be capable of restarting at the point of freeze, start of mission, or at a dynamic instructor-selected point in the mission. The IOS must also be able to set mark points and repeatedly reset to those points. The IOS needs to allow generation of additional scenarios of varying classification levels concurrently with flying a scenario.
4)	Visual Display System.  The simulator system must include a state-of-the-art, high-fidelity digital image to present the pilot with realistic, detailed, real-world imagery. This includes a fully correlated out-the-window visual display system supporting all aspects of complete mission training, including all cues necessary to support such training, as defined in ACC F-15C training syllabi, to include night vision imaging systems. At a minimum, dynamic air model assessments (determination of range, closure, and aspect angle) must support multi-ship tactical formations and basic fighter maneuvers (BFM) cues.  The visual display will provide a high-fidelity image (contrast, brightness resolution, scene complexity, etc.) to the pilot.
5)	Networking.  The MTC must provide local area and wide area network capability and use the most current long-haul networking protocols. The systems will be capable of connecting to and being a full participant in the DMO environment for one, two, or more trainers and will be required to meet the CAF DMO standards.
6)	Briefing/Debriefing Facilities.  The brief/debrief capability should be able to provide a Gods eye view, selected cockpit or target views, and full battlefield observation (observation of the entire scenario, or a selectable major portion thereof). The system should include the ability to observe sensor outputs, including Joint Tactical Information Distribution Systems (JTIDS), radar, or visual display.  The system must have the capability to record full mission data for replay. The recordings should be both archivable on removable media and transferable to other sites over the network.  Minimum recording time length of 120 minutes will be supported (a longer recording time is highly desired). The current brief/debrief system represents an example of the required capability. The brief/debrief capability should be able to provide before the  mission planning or briefing mode, after the mission debrief capability, and real time observation capability to watch the mission as it unfolds. The before/after mission period modes require a video teleconferencing capability for all participating crews, at the appropriate classification levels.
d)	F-15C pilots obtain over 20 percent of their overall training events through the MTC; therefore, Air Combat Command requires no break in training during the transition from the incumbent contractor.e)	F-15C MTCs must be delivered and maintained in a fully operational status that remains concurrent with the home station aircraft configuration and that maintains the ability to be available for use at least 95 percent of the time.

Email responses must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST) on the specified closing date/time of this Sources Sought FBO Notice.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from participation in this standardization effort.

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 4:00 PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer. 

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated 
below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting

2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3) – Acceptable; Four (4) – Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.00 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. (EST) fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.    

a. In general, “acceptability” for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
(1) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; and
(2) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of “technical acceptability.”  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion below, as required.

The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors must provide a response to each criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Safety Blood Collection Devices products. A ‘complete line of product’ is defined as the MTFs’ requirements for ‘usage items’ in the product line.  ‘Usage items’ are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:

1.	Safety Blood Collection Needles, 21g X 11/4”, 22ga X 11/4”
2.	Safety Lancets: Finger, Heel 1mm Dx 2.5 Path Length Blade Infant
3.	Blood Collection Set 23g X 12in Tubing w/Wings Female Luer Safety

Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.
2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Safety Blood Collection Devices product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
3.	Vendors must have, or be obtaining, a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Owens and Minor) for distribution in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional Prime Vendor (PV) will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors will be asked to provide an initial quote on discounts, in response to the FBO RFQ.  Vendors determined to be clinically acceptable, after clinical evaluation, may have an opportunity to submit a final quote at that time.
5.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.
6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Safety Blood Collection Devices products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.

                packaging to facilitate efficient clinical process and to avoid unnecessary waste of 
                product.
	b. This criterion will be evaluated by visual inspection of the packaging.
 2. The Safety Blood Collection Needle safety mechanism is easy to activate and the needle is sharp with a well defined bevel.
	a. The ease of activation of the safety mechanism, combined with a sharp needle        
                with a well defined bevel, allows the clinician to maintain proper blood drawing  
                technique and contributes to patient/clinician safety. 
	b. The safety mechanism activation, needle sharpness, and bevel definition will be 
                evaluated by the clinician during the blood collection procedure.
3. The Needle Holder provides for a secure attachment of the safety blood collection needle.
	a. A secure attachment of the safety needle to the needle holder must be achieved to 
                prevent patient/clinician injury during the blood collection procedure.
	b. This criterion will be evaluated by the clinician attaching the safety needle to the  
                 holder and attempting to forcibly remove the needle from the holder.
4. The Phlebotomy Tourniquet provides and maintains sufficient pressure to successfully accomplish the blood collection procedure.
	a. Provision and maintenance of pressure by the tourniquet allows blood to build up   
          in the vessel to be utilized in the blood collection procedure.	 
	b. The clinician will evaluate this criterion by applying the tourniquet and assessing  
                the build up, and maintenance, of blood in the vessel to be utilized.
5. The Safety Lancet is easily activated and produces blood flow sufficient for the filling of the capillary tube.  
	a. The ease of activation and the production of sufficient blood flow is vital to the 
                successful completion of the blood collection procedure utilizing the capillary tube.

	a. The safety mechanism ease of activation, needle sharpness and bevel definition, 
                visualization of blood “flash” and sufficient tubing length are critical to ensuring 
                patient/clinician safety and successful procedure completion.
	b. The clinician will perform the blood collection procedures to evaluate 
                this criterion.
7. The Blood Transfer Device is easily utilized without direct exposure of the clinician to 
the blood specimen.
	a. The ease of utilization of the Blood Transfer Device without direct clinician 
                exposure to the blood specimen contributes to clinician safety and the prevention  
                of transmission of blood borne disease.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

1.	Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting

2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3) – Acceptable; Four (4) – Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.00 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. (EST) fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.    

a. In general, “acceptability” for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
(1) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; and
(2) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

a.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of “technical acceptability.”  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion below, as required.

The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.




Vendors must provide a response to each criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Safety Blood Collection Tube products. A ‘complete line of product’ is defined as the MTFs’ requirements for ‘usage items’ in the product line.  ‘Usage items’ are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

At a minimum, a complete product line includes:

-  Tubes Vacuum Blood Collection SST Safety Top Plastic, Polymer w/Clot Activator 13 X 75 and 13 X 100 Paper Labels (various sizes to include: 3.5ml, 5ml, 7ml)

---------------
A.	 General Information

     The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of Surgeon’s Gloves, to include, but not limited to Gloves Surgical Sterile Synthetic Powder Free, sizes 6.5 to 8.5; Gloves Surgical Sterile Synthetic Powder Free Beaded Cuff, sizes 6.5 to 8.5; Gloves Surgical Sterile Latex Powder Free, sizes 6.5 to 8.5; and Gloves Surgical Sterile Latex Powder Free Beaded Cuff, sizes 6.5 to 8.5.  The major facilities in the area includes: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

    The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).

If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

1.	Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting.  

2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3) – Acceptable; Four (4) – Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.

Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.00 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. (EST) fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1.  The size and type of Surgeons Glove is easily identified from the packaging
	a. The clinician must be able to easily identify the size and type of glove to facilitate 
                 efficient clinical process and to avoid unnecessary waste of product
	b. This criterion will be evaluated by visual inspection of the packaging
2. Surgeons glove sterility is reliably maintained during delivery of glove to a sterile field from the packaging
	a. The maintenance of glove sterility is an essential element in minimizing the risk of 
                 infection to the patient
	b. The clinician will evaluate this criterion by opening the package and delivering 
                the glove to a sterile field utilizing accepted standard clinical practices.
3. The Surgeons Gloves are easily donned utilizing the single, double, open, and closed gloving techniques
	a. The ability of the clinician to easily put on the gloves via the single, double,  
                open, and closed gloving techniques is vital to the clinician preparation for the
                procedure.
	b. Evaluation of this criterion will be accomplished via the clinician putting on the 
                gloves utilizing the single, double, open, and closed gloving procedures
 4. The Surgeons Glove cuff length is sufficient to fit over, and maintain position on, the surgical gown sleeve
	a. A good fit, and position maintenance, of the glove cuff over the surgical gown 
                sleeve is required to maintain the integrity of the of the clinician to patient barrier
	b. Evaluation will be accomplished by the clinician putting on the glove, covering 
                the gown sleeve with the cuff of the glove, and performing (or simulating expected 
                arm/hand movements) of a surgical procedure
5. The Surgeons Glove provides reliable clinician to patient barrier maintenance 
	a. Reliable maintenance of the clinician to patient barrier is a critical element in 
                minimizing risk of infection to the patient and reducing the risk of exposure to 
                blood and other body fluids to the clinician 
	b. The reliability of the clinician to patient barrier will be assessed via the clinician 
                use of the glove in the performance of a surgical procedure (or the simulation 
                thereof)
 6. The Surgeons Glove provides the required level of comfort, flexibility/dexterity, and tactile sensitivity.
	a. The characteristics of comfort, flexibility/dexterity, and tactile sensitivity (the 
                sense of touch) are extremely important in the clinician’s ability to handle 
                surgical instruments, perform intricate movements, identify anatomical locations,
                etc. during a surgical procedure.
	b. The characteristics of comfort, flexibility/dexterity, and tactile sensitivity will be
                evaluated by the clinician using the glove during surgical procedure (or
                simulation thereof)

A.	 General Information

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of Pharmaceutical Containers to include, but not limited to:

   	1. Prescription Vials, Amber, Plastic, Reversible Child Resistant/Non-Child
	     resistant Caps to include 16, 30, 60, and 90 dram sizes
	   2. Pharmaceutical Bottles (with lids) available in multiple sizes to include 90,  
                   120, and 150 dram sizes
   3. Pharmaceutical Jars (with lids) available in multiple sizes to include 1, 2, 
       4, and 8 ounce sizes

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

    The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor) or the Pharmacy Prime Vendor (Amerisource Bergen).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

Portsmouth, VA  23708

Email responses must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST) on the specified closing date/time of this Sources Sought FBO Notice.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from participation in this standardization effort.

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 4:00 PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer. 

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated 
below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting.

2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3) – Acceptable; Four (4) – Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.00 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. (EST) fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.    

a. In general, “acceptability” for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
(1) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; and
(2) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of “technical acceptability.”  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion below, as required.

The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors must provide a response to each criterion listed below:

1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Pharmaceutical Container products. A ‘complete 
     line of product’ is defined as the MTFs’ requirements for ‘usage items’ in the product line.
    ‘Usage items’ are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, 
     as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for 
     the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result 
     in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort

             a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:

1. Prescription Vials, Amber, Plastic, Reversible Child Resistant/Non-Child
	      resistant Caps to include 16, 30, 60, and 90 dram sizes

<SUBJECT>Cadastral Surveying and Engineering Services, on an IDIQ basis, National Forest and Grasslands in Texas
<SOLNBR>AG-447U-S-08-0043LI
<RESPDATE>051508
<CONTACT>Laura M. Ingram, Contract Specialist, Email lauraingram@fs.fed.us - Yvonne M Steward, Procurement Technician, Phone (601)965-1646, Fax (601)965-1788, Email ysteward@fs.fed.us
<DESC> The USDA, Forest Service has a requirement for Cadastral Surveying and Engineering Services on a recurring basis, and anticipates the award of Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contracts for three work area Zones that comprise land within the administrative boundaries of the National Forests & Grasslands in Texas. The performance period for each contract awarded will be an initial calendar year from the date of award with the potential exercise of up to four 4 option years at the discretion of the Government. Only one Contractor will receive an award per Zone; however, a single contractor may be eligible to receive an award for multiple Zones. The minimum amount of awarded work will be $2,500.00 per contract. Individual task orders will be issued against each contract as needed to accomplish the work. The minimum single order that can be placed against each contract will be $2,500; the maximum single order that can be placed against each contract will be $500,000. 

The NAICS code for this project is 541370 with a size standard of $4.5 million. This procurement is a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The award of any contracts related to this announcement will not preclude the Forest Service from using either its own surveyors or other surveying firms to perform cadastral surveying or engineering services within the subject project areas.

Work will be performed in rural areas having relatively flat to hilly topography. Some areas will be forested; the degree of forestation that may be encountered is dependent on the location of the Zone and its predominant geophysical characteristics. The work will include but may not necessarily be limited to locating boundary lines, refurbishing existing boundary markings and brushing along the line, painting boundary trees, posts and corners, adding/replacing signs and possibly re-setting of corners.  The Cadastral Surveying portion of the work will be primarily dependant resurvey and section subdivision. The Engineering Services portion of the work will primarily be centerline profile and cross-section for timber access road designs.

Zones will be composed as follows: Zone 1 consists of the Angelina and Davy Crockett National Forests; Zone 2 consists of the Sam Houston National Forest and the Sabine National Forest; Zone 3 consists of the Caddo/LBJ National Grasslands.  These Zones include land located in the following Texas counties: Angelina, San Augustine, Trinity, Houston, Sabine, Montgomery, Walker, Shelby, Jasper, Newton, San Jacinto, Nacogdoches, Montague, Wise and Fannin.

This is not a request for proposals.  Solicitation packages are not provided with this prospectus. Interested, qualified, experienced firms with proven capability in providing Cadastral Surveying and Architectural Services of the type described in this prospectus are invited to submit a Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire, both Part II, General Qualifications and Part I, Contract Specific Qualifications, and a Quality Control Plan addressing office and field procedures/ techniques when performing surveys, before the closing date of this announcement. Only firms currently employing registered land surveyors with up-to-date registrations and licenses for professional surveying in the State of Texas will be considered for selection. 
Faxed forms will not be accepted.

Based upon the criteria described below, an evaluation board will select a “pool” of the best-qualified firms for each Zone with an identified order of preference based on demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional service to be provided (in accordance with Brooks Act procedures). Interested firms should indicate, with the submission of their SF-330 forms, which Zones for which they wish to receive consideration (may be indicated in a cover letter). Data provided on the SF-330 forms will provide the only basis for assigning ratings, and those forms should specifically address the stated evaluation factors, listed below in descending order of importance:

1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services (includes but not necessarily limited to educational and background experience of registered land surveyors(s) who will be performing the work, including college, vocational school, continuing education, etc.) Although not mandatory, membership(s) in professional land surveyors organization(s) is/are also indicative of optimum professional standing.

2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required. In support of this, interested Contractors must submit exhibits of certified section division cadastral surveys in rural, forested areas of a type that may be found in project sites within the Zones subject to this prospectus.  Each exhibit will be accompanied by a Report of Survey.  Evaluation will cover all parts of the survey and report of survey including: format and neatness; evaluation of ground evidence such as rock piles, fences, roads, aerial photos, etc.; reference to title and survey records; procedures and descriptions used to subdivide and monument cadastral surveys; evaluation and documentation of original evidence (complexity); documentation of adjoiner’s testimony; accuracy statement and certification; the firm’s Quality Control Plan addressing office and field procedures and techniques when performing surveys; and any other pertinent information. NOTE:  a report of survey is required for each cadastral exhibit submitted.  

3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time (Contractors must include information on current and projected workload).

4) Past performance on cadastral survey contracts with Government agencies and private industry, performed in rural and wooded terrain similar to the project areas proposed in this prospectus, in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. Information provided should demonstrate project management capabilities based on size and number of previous similar projects, type and adequacy of support capabilities such as office and field equipment, time and manpower allotted to the project, list of technical personnel and their qualifications and capacity work of the potential magnitude of the contracts described in this prospectus. Contractors should specifically describe land surveying experience of RLS in timbered lands typical of the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas.  Past performance on both Forest Service and non-Forest Service projects will be considered.

5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and

6) Acceptability under other appropriate evaluation criteria, which are:
	
a) Knowledge of local surveying historical practices, records repositories, and land ownership patterns.

b) Exhibits of road designs (cross sections) and construction surveys, both data collection (field notes) and final drawings. Evaluation will cover exhibit format and clarity. Interested firms are limited to providing three exhibits.

c) The volume of work awarded by the Forest Service will be evaluated with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of the contracts among qualified firms, including minority or small disadvantaged firms, or other small firms that propose to subcontract significant portions of the work to small or disadvantaged firms.

Registration in the Central Contractor Registry (http://www.ccr.gov) before the award of any contract is mandatory, and Contractors receiving awards must maintain a CCR registration over the entire life of the contract.

Please submit five (5) complete copies of the requested information to Laura M. Ingram, Contracting Officer, at USDA, Forest Service, Western Operations Center-AQM, 100 W. Capitol Street, Ste 1141, Jackson, MS 39269-1602.

<DESC>The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is seeking sources to provide comment analysis services and products for a wide array of projects. These projects include all phases of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis, policy making, rule making, and land management planning. Most projects have a high level of political or public interest, including those of national scope and those likely to be controversial, litigated, or appealed.

The contractor(s) selected for this effort will be required to provide all professional services, nonprofessional services, management, supervision, a strong quality control program, infrastructure, facilities, equipment, tools, supplies, materials, transportation, incidental items, and services necessary to produce acceptable content analysis and results in accordance with the contract performance work statement.

In performing content analysis, the contractor shall be able to directly receive public comments via a variety of delivery methods, systematically categorize, organize, analyze, and summarize public comments generated by land management proposals.

The content analysis process includes the following steps: 

1. Receiving and Processing Mail:
Receiving, opening, date-stamping, copying, scanning, and logging all mail received in an accountable, timely manner. Information about the senders, such as the organization or entity sending the letter, their address, and name must be tracked to each letter. Multiple identical letters (forms) must be identified early in the process for efficiency. Must follow a real-time accountable system to identify and quickly find any given letter received on a project.

2. Identifying and Coding Responses:
All letters must be read, identifying substantive stand-alone statements or complete thoughts (called comments) by subject matter experts.  These comments shall be logically categorized (coded) with all other similar statements based on the action they request, resources effected, and rationale.

3. Data Entry:
All coded comments will be entered into a database, along with the letter’s identifying information.  Contractors may choose to use the government provided Oracle database, or create their own database for managing comment information.  Data from the database must be easily transferable to the government’s data warehouse.

4. Writing Public Concerns and other Products:
Each unique action requested in a comment or group of comments will require writing a Public Concern.  A Public Concern summarizes a comment or group of comments to facilitate an interdisciplinary team’s response to the comments. Other products include writing executive summaries (a brief overview of the concerns), narrative summaries (a detailed narrative of all concerns), or other supplementary written products dependent upon specific task order requirements.

5. Reporting:
Weekly reports that include the number of letters received requests for information, FOIA requests, threats of litigation, and other key information that will be provided to the client on a weekly basis.  Access to electronic letters and the project database also must be provided.  A final mailing list of all respondents and a report of all comments organized by categorization codes must be provided at the end of the project.

6. Project Record Production:
Both an electronic project record and a physical record need to be created. The electronic record must contain all respondents, including names and mailing addresses connected to the letters, scanned copies of the letters, all reports and written products. All original and coded letters must be filed and preserved.
 
Interested organizations may submit their interest, capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to Todd Mathie, Contracting Officer, by 15 May 2008. Please include your business type and size in your response.

<DESC>Statement of Work For Geographic Information System (GIS) and Planning Resource for Infrastructure Development and Evaluation (PRIDE) Integration Services for the<BR>Wisconsin Army National Guard (WIARNG)<BR><BR>2400 Wright Street<BR>Madison, Wisconsin<BR><BR>PART I  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.<BR><BR>	A.	Responsibility:  The successful contractor shall furnish sufficient technical, supervisory, and administrative personnel to insure the expeditious accomplishment of the work specified in this Statement ofWork (SOW).  Additionally, the contractor shall furnish all services, materials, supplies, equipment, investigations, studies, and travel required in connection with this SOW.<BR><BR>	B.	Direction:  The contractor shall accept directions only from the Construction and Facilities Management Officer (CFMO) for the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs (DMA) or the duly authorized designated representative.  Requests or desires of the Users or Using Agency made directly to the contractor will be immediately brought to the attention of the CFMO.  Any changes to the project scope or other provisions of this SOW must be authorized in writing by the CFMO.  The WIARNG Project POC is Mr. David J. Molitor, Office Phone (608) 242-3384 Email: dave.molitor@wi.gov .<BR><BR>	C.	Program Summary:  The WIARNG has a requirement to collect, develop and maintain an accurate Real Property Inventory. This inventory is maintained on the PRIDE Database which is an Oracle based client server application maintained by the National Guard Bureau (NGB). PRIDE provides the state and NGB real property inventory, real estate management, work order/ service order processing, budgeting, project management, master planning and real estate and property reporting. Data from PRIDE is visible atDepartment of Defense and used in part to distribute operations and maintenance (O&M) and minor construction resources. PRIDE data is also used by congress and NGB to prioritize military construction (MILCON) projects. Furthermore the WIARNG has a requirement to collect and develop a Geographic Information System (GIS). GIS provides its user a data interface which geographically represents and compiles data for strategic planning and tactical decision making. This tool is most effective when the data is accessible to the most basic users and from a facility management point of view integrated with the real property database.<BR><BR>	D.	General Approach:   Contractor needs to know and have access to the PRIDE software.  Development of GIS / PRIDE data for the WIARNG sites requires completion of a number of steps. Data must be collected and created in GIS, reconciled with PRIDE, additional facilities input in PRIDE if necessary, and room / asset information input. Digital photos, GPS information, and PRIDE attributes are collected as part of the data collection process. This information should be organized in a manner easily available to staff in the office.<BR><BR>To achieve an efficient and clearly defined process, one site will be inventoried, the data entered, and the product reviewed with WIARNG CFMO project manager to ensure the data is captured and organized in the desired manner. Adjustments can be made to the collection and entry process on the remaining sites if necessary. <BR><BR>	E.	Budget and Contracting: Cost estimates will be provided as Not to Exceed amounts for each task listed below, billed on a time and materials basis. The nature and condition of all existing electronic data from various sources cannot be determined prior to detailed survey. Costs include a minimum number of items to be completed; additional room and equipment level data will be inventoried if possible.<BR><BR>	F.	Scheduling: Test site to be completed within 90 days of contract award.  Remainder of project schedule and milestones will be determined at time of contract award.<BR><BR><BR>PART II    PROJECT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.<BR>   <BR>Task 1: Collect room and asset level data for all WIARNG facilities to include Preventive Maintenance (PM) frequencies.<BR>Rooms and asset / equipment level data will be created for all WIARNG facilities. See enclosure 1 for a list of assets to be included (NOTE: This list may not be all-inclusive).  Enclosures 2 and 3 contain a location map and address list of WIARNG facilities. The current WIARNG Real Property Inventory is available upon request.<BR><BR>Existing CAD drawings of building floor plans will be provided by the WIARNG Project Manager. Room polylines will be digitized (to the interior walls) from these CAD drawings. GIS data will be created from the room polylines and Category Codes, Agreement Support Codes, and UICs will be assigned to the rooms with guidance from WIARNG Real Property staff. Room data will be entered into PRIDE with associated room utilization information.<BR><BR>A site visit will be conducted to verify room information and collect equipment information. (Any additional facility items can also be resolved during this site visit). Digital photos will be taken of rooms and equipment. WIARNG maintenance staff can and are encouraged to attend this site visit and will provide guidance on the assignment of unique asset tag numbers for entry into PRIDE. An equipment information sheet (enclosure 4) will be populated and approved by WIARNG maintenance staff for each piece of equipment to be entered into PRIDE. Equipment will be entered into PRIDE.<BR><BR>CAD data, GIS data and digital photos collected during the room level inventory process will be provided to the WIARNG Project Manger.<BR><BR>The above process and products will be reviewed prior to inventorying additional sites. The products are intended to provide complete facilities accountability in the PRIDE data and in GIS. The process (specifically for room and equipment inventory) needs to be replicable by WIARNG staff for future data collection and PRIDE input needs.<BR><BR>Additional sites will be collected with the same process. Where possible, site visits for facility, room, and equipment information will be reduced to one to save costs. <BR><BR>Task 2: Create facility GIS data<BR>The WIARNG project manager will provide existing GIS data and aerial imagery for each site as available. GIS data contains boundaries and limited facilities. GIS data will be created for remaining facilities by digitizing features from the imagery. <BR><BR>Task 3: Reconcile GIS and PRIDE data<BR>GIS features digitized from the imagery will be reconciled with PRIDE facility records, where possible. Staffwill meet with WIARNG GIS and Real Property staff to match as many GIS features to PRIDE records as possible. New facilities identified from the imagery will be assigned facility numbers based on guidance from the WIARNG Real Property administrator. Facilities that are currently grouped under a single PRIDE record, such as parking, will be split into multiple facilities if they are non-contiguous.<BR><BR>A site visit will be conducted to reconcile any GIS / PRIDE records still outstanding. Additional GIS features will be collected for facilities not visible in the photos, such as flagpoles, facility signs, etc. Resource grade GPS data will be used to collect new facilities features. Digital photographs will be taken of each facility.<BR><BR>A final reconciliation of GIS features to PRIDE records will be conducted, with the assistance of the WIARNG Real Property staff where necessary. New facilities will be documented using the DD Form 1354. With the approval of the WIARNG Real Property administrator, data from the approved DD Form 1354 will be entered into PRIDE to create the new facilities. DD Form 1354s and supporting documentation will be submitted to NGB staff for reputability approval.<BR><BR>GPS data, GIS data, and digital photos collected during the inventory process will be provided to the WIARNG Project Manager.<BR><BR>Task 4: RPI Asset Tags and Facility Numbers<BR>Change RPI asset tags to represent a more user friendly number.  For example, change existing asset tag # 55RPI00000036 to 55A80GATE01.<BR><BR>Consolidate Facility Numbers into a single group with separate facilities listed as areas within that number.  For example, at locations where each concrete pad is listed as a separate facility, create a facility number 55A05-CPADS and list each pad as an area within that facility  dumpster pad, transformer pad, access pad, etc.<BR><BR>Task 5: Conduct Inventory/PRIDE Maintenance Module Training<BR>This training is not to exceed 3 days and will be given to approximately 10 personnel.  Training will consist of procedures used to accomplish tasks 1-4 above, training staff to conduct further surveys for new items added after this project is complete.

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a highly functional and highly sensitive AC resistance bridge for low power dissipation resistance measurement in a cryogenic environment. The results of this market research will be used to identify vendors that are capable of meeting the required specifications and delivery date. Requests for price quotations and delivery schedules will be generated base on the information obtained.
<p>NIST has a need for an AC resistance bridge that would meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. Resistance Measurements: The following resistance measurement capability must be achievable with a 1/e settling time-constant of 3.5 seconds or less;</p>
<p>Resistance Rage (Ohms) Maximum Excitation Current (A) Maximum Resistance Resolution (Ohms)<br />25,000 - 15,000 4.0 E-8 0.07<br />600 - 300 2.0 E-8 0.1<br />160 - 80 2.0 E-7 0.01<br />60 - 40 3.0 E-7 0.004</p>
<p><br />2. Excitation Current: For each of the resistance ranges in 1) the excitation current must have full manual adjustability for a sample resistor power dissipation that covers the range of 100 nW to 50 fW;</p>
<p>3. Analog Output: There must be a programmable analog voltage output that is capable of generating a signal that is at least 9 V in range, resolution of 0.005% of full range which is linear through the range, and be configurable to put out a signal that is proportional to resitance over a programmable resistance range. The update rate for this output shall be at least 5 times per second</p>
<p><br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 333314, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. <BR><BR>Product Manager Forward Looking Infrared (PM FLIR) is conducting market research to determine the status of currently available products and technologies capable of providing an affordable low cost materiel solution for a 360 degree situational awareness program called the Close Surveillance Support System (CS3).  TheCS3 system is comprised of both A-Kits (platform installation and integration items) and B-Kits (CS3 system components) which are considered to be the critical elements in assessing the CS3 programs affordability.  The CS3 system is intended to meet increased mission requirements associated with Survivability, Mobility and Lethality as outlined in Capability Development  Documents (CDD) for the Stryker Brigade Combat Team (Operational Requirements Documents to CDD conversion, 14 Dec 2007) and the various Combat Vehicle customer requirements (PM Heavy Brigade Combat Team and Marine Corps, 7 Dec 2007).  Current and future Army doctrine requires this capability to conduct sustained operations, 24 hours a day, during all weather and light conditions, executed over extended distances.  Combat Vehicles are a vital element of all types of units.  This capability is needed to allow the users/operators to maintain situational awareness while under armor during day and nighttime operations and during times of impaired visibility (fog, smoke, and dust). CS3 is not intended to be used as targeting system for fire control. PM FLIR is interested in technology solutions with readiness levels that can support production and fielding within six months of contract award.<BR><BR>System Description:  CS3 is a collection of color visible and Infrared (IR) cameras mounted around the top and sides of the vehicle platform, user interface hardware, and a digital recording capability integrated into the vehicle.  The CS3 will support independent multiple user capability and provide various operators with a 360 degree cumulative Horizontal Field of Regard while under armor, in day, night and degraded visibility conditions, particularly in urban and complex terrain with a Vertical Field of View of approximately 30 degrees.  The CS3 is intended to provide the operators the ability to 1) Observe immediate area around the vehicle; 2) Identify potential threats; 3) Prevent vehicle injury to dismounted soldiers; 4) Prevent vehicle injury to non-combatants; 5) Improve vehicle maneuvering; 6) Provide Vehicle commander and driver with day/night visibility in all directions vehicle can move; 7) Allow Vehicle commander and driver to scan intersections without exposing entire vehicle; 8) Allow driverto back-up without assistance.  The CS3 system is planned for installation on Army and USMC ground based platforms such as the Stryker FOV and the M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle.   Notional quantities for the various platforms are anticipated to range from 1000 to 4000. <BR><BR>In addition to technology and product maturity considerations, the government is specifically interested in receiving industry feedback on the feasibility of implementing Size, Weight, and power reduction initiatives that would result in overall lower total unit costs for both A and B Kits as well as novel vehicle related integration strategies utilizing current/approved onboard systems.  Other areas of interest to the government include industry suggestions for economic ordering quantities, delivery schedules and production ramp up considerations.<BR><BR>Interested parties responding to this RFI should 1) have a strong background and detailedknowledge in IR and color sensors ; 2) have a proven and demonstrated integration capability; 3) have a demonstrated and detailed working knowledge of the Armys Vision Enhancement and targeting systems; 4) have a proven and demonstrated capability in complex systems architecture with emphasis on networking communications and interface issues (e.g. bandwidth and interface analysis); 5) have a significant technology base and/or manufacturing and operating infrastructure (facilities and capabilities) that can readily support detailed coordination with users, and installation, operation and support of this system; and 6) Possess Security Clearances up to and including TS/SCI.  Industry responses must include sufficient documentation to support any claims thattheir system performance will meet the minimum performance capabilities contained herein. Such documentation may include system technical specifications, product brochures and related literature, performance test data, system drawings and/or photographs, or any other data to support the state of system development and or production readiness.  Additionally, industry responses are to specifically include an outline of supply chain considerations with emphasis on any known long lead items that may adversely impact high rate production in an accelerated environment.  Any limitations to ramping up to high rate monthly production and system integration considerations must be addressed along with proposed resolutions to potential production impediments.  Projected monthly production capabilities to include critical subcontractor and vendor production capacity along with estimated unit prices, should also be submitted.<BR><BR>Interested parties possessing the qualifications outlined above are requested to provide aWhite Paper describing:<BR>1.	Corporate capabilities, past and current relevant performance information, available facilities and assets.<BR>2.	Indicate whether your companys interest in the CS3 system program is as a system developer and integrator, a subcontractor with specific areas of expertise or as a potential component supplier.<BR>3.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia seeks sources and information for a new family of tactical solar electric power systems.  The goal of this program is to identify commercially available, non-developmental solar electric power systems in two size ranges: a two (2) man-portable ( 88 lbs) system and a trailer mounted, High Mobility Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) towable system that does not exceed 4200 lbs, including the trailer. The systems must be capable of sustained operation in extreme environments (high shock, temperatures ranging from -20F to +131F, etc.) and be easy and safe to operate by incidental operators with minimal training.  It is desired that the systems maximize power output while retaining some inherent energy storage capability to provide minimal power during night time operations.  Both Direct Current (DC) and Alternating Current (AC) systems are sought.
Commercial firms possessing the characteristics noted in any of the above systems are encouraged and invited to submit product brochures and pricing materials outlining specifications, to include a statement of capabilities. Responses will be reviewed to identify firms potentially capable of fulfilling the Governments requirements. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only at the current stage.  
The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for the information requested. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort. If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. Responses to this RFI shall be mailed to Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: Moxi Mi-GTES, 2200 Lester Ave, Quantico, VA 22134-6050 no later than 09 Jun, 2008. FEDEX or UPS deliveries should be sent to MARCORSYSCOM Material Management, Attn: Moxi Mi-GTES, 2201A Willis St, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.

<DESC>Proposed addition of Biobased Glass and Steel Cleaner to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.

This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Biobased Glass and Steel Cleaner by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Glass and Steel Cleaner, Biobased, 24 oz. aerosol
7930-00-NIB-0547

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Southwest Supply Center, Fort Worth, TX.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Glass and Steel Cleaner to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

7930-01-294-5523
ZEP 014402
ZEP 014401

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Biobased Glass and Steel Cleaner to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than, May 5, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.

<DESC>The Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate for an extension of contract HHSN261200544006C with Research Triangle Institute (RTI). The title of this project is Informatics Support Center for Breast and Colon Cancer Family Registries (BC-CFR’s).  This extension is planned under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  A follow on contract modification will prevent a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  This project is for the continued data coordination/management and statistical/technical support experience as well as capabilities in software development for the purposes of data management and quality control. 
To perform the requirements of this contract, the Contractor must be well versed in the Breast and Colon-Cancer Family Registries (BC-CFR), particularly the participating sites and the local informatics units.  The Contractor must have an understanding of, and comply with National Cancer Institute’s Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB) specifications; provide relevant technical training and assistance to the BC-CFR participating sites and NCI; and provide statistical and study design support to the BC-CFR investigators, their collaborators and NCI.  RTI has already built a significant data management and quality control infrastructure, transferred the original Informatics Support Center (ISC) central database to this infrastructure, performed data cleaning, develop a number of software applications requested by NCI as well as the BC-CFR community, developed a virtual tissue repository pilot system, received and aggregated data transmitted from the BC-CFR sites, and provided requested data sets to investigators under contract number HHSN261200544006C.  The proposed contract extension will permit RTI to continue (1) quality control and cleaning of core and ancillary data; (2) to maintain data available to the scientific community through the BC-CFR collaborative projects; (3) to provide high-quality datasets to Principal Investigators of BC-CFR approved projects; (4) development and maintenance of the Biospecimen Tracking System; (5) maintenance and enhancement of the Virtual Tissue Repository; (6) to provide statistical methodology and research design support to BC-CFR investigators and NCI,  and (7) to evaluate and develop software tools as needed.   Interruption of these activities while another contractor gains the knowledge required to provide these data coordination services to the BC-CFR investigators and collaborators would lead to a paralysis of continuity and enhancement of the central database, as well as the development and support of collaborative projects.  Therefore, the Government has determined that Research Triangle Institute is the only able source to satisfy agency requirements to avoid these unacceptable delays or a duplication of effort. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement and must respond by submitting the information on/before the closing date noted in this announcement. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate knowledge and experience of the Breast and Colon Cancer Family Registries (BC-CFR), particularly the participating sites and the local informatics units. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of cost and effort. NUMBERED NOTE 22: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.Interested parties may submit capability statements to the Contracting Officer noted below. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a time-and-materials (T&M) acquisition with the ZANTAZ, Inc.  This non-competitive action is being issued by the Department of the Interior - National Business Center on behalf of the Office of the Secretary / Office of the Chief Information Officer.
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-3, Expert Services?for any current or anticipated litigation or dispute, and solicited in accordance with FAR 15 Contracting by Negotiation.  The Government has a requirement for continued email capture, archiving, storage, search and retrieval.
These requirements are necessary to satisfy rulings and Court orders in regard to Civil Action No. 1:96 CV 01285 (RCL) Cobell v. Kempthorne in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia.  This litigation is ongoing, and is expected to continue indefinitely.  The e-mail project has three major components.  First: to process e-mail backup tapes on as as-needed basis to ensure all e-mails and related information are in the repository and available for retrieval of material potentially responsive to outstanding discovery requests and document requests.  Second: to maintain real-time capture of all e-mail on a going forward basis for inclusion in a searchable and retrievable e-mail repository.  Third: to assess whether existing policies and current practices are in compliance with Court obligations and industry best practices.
The Zantaz software currently in use is proprietary, and has been designed and modified for the special needs and requirements to satisfy various legal requirements and Court orders.  Recent experience with IT issues in Cobell v. Kempthorne suggests that only Zantaz currently has the very specific knowledge and expertise to comply with standards established by the Court regarding e-mail capture, restoration, retention and search, because the e-mail project is carried out pursuant to Court order.  A Court order filed on May 26, 2005, orders and requires DOI to award a contract which will capture, archive, and produce certain Court specified Interior e-mails. As proposed by DOI and agreed to by the Court, the vendor to provide these services is Zantaz.  
Due to the very specific knowledge, expertise and experience gained by Zantaz performing under this ongoing litigation, it would be an unacceptable legal risk for DOI to attempt a transition of duties and services in any reasonable time and avoid potentially adverse discontinued services, evidentiary rulings, possible contempt allegations, and increased costs in the form of sanctions and the need to defend against new or renewed allegations relating to e-mail non-compliance.

ATC Mobile currently utilizes three (3) OFTs and two (2) cockpit pilot trainers (CPT) to cycle over 700 students through Aviation Transition, Re-Qualification , and Proficiency Courses annually.

<DESC>The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR Part 6.302.  Award will be made on a sole source basis to National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) for a basic plus 3 option years under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This announcement constitutes the only notice and solicitation. Quotations are being accepted and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This contract is for publication of two (2) full-page advertisements; One (1) full page, four (4) color display and one (1) full-page editorial in the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) through electronic and printed media. This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through  Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24. The NAICS Code is 511120; size standard 500 employees.

NATURE OF ACQUISITION:

The Planning Job Choices publication reaches over three hundred thousand readers and the Minority Edition enjoys the largest circulation of any minorities/careers-related publication in the college market.   It is distributed on more than 1,700 campuses including: 97 Historically Black Colleges and Universities; 64 Hispanic Serving Institutions; 29 Tribal School; and 744 institutions having a high minority population.  Also, the publication must reach accredited college and university campuses and the top 500 employers nationwide in support of Palace Acquire and Copper Cap Programs, Civilian Careers for Headquarters Air Force Personnel Center, Randolph AFB, TX.

The proposed sole source is the only known source that can satisfy the Government’s complete requirement because of their ability to provide publications that offers broad distribution capabilities. Our research indicated that other publications target only specific minorities or specific schools; none have the wide-circulation of these publications.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>1 Scope <br />California and Santa Barbara County have numerous and stringent environmental air quality statutes and regulations that directly affect VAFB operations. The local regulatory agency, Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (SBCAPCD), rigorously administers its delegated authority to write local air quality rules and regulations and then enforce them. Adherence to local, state, and federal air quality regulations supports VAFB operations and ensures mission success. <br />Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) has upgraded the Military Gasoline Dispensing Facility (GDF) to California Air Resources Board (CARB) approved Phase II Enhanced Vapor Recovery (EVR) with In-Station Diagnostics (IDS). This SOW will provide for repair and testing of this equipment.</p>
<p>1.1 Background<br />To reduce the emissions of volatile organic compounds, EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) promulgated regulations requiring the control of emissions from motor vehicle fueling operations. The required equipment captured the emissions as fuel was loaded into the facility storage tanks and motor vehicles and are referred to as recovery systems. Phase I equipment captures the emissions from the loading of fuel into the facility storage tanks, while Phase II equipment captures the emissions from dispensing fuel into motor vehicles. With the need to further control emissions from dispensing fuel into motor vehicles, CARB approved Phase II EVR systems were developed and required to be installed by April 2009.</p>

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, Lori Staples 8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103 USAFA, CO 80840 Telephone number 719-333-2074 FAX 719-333-9018 email: lori.staples@usafa.af.mil Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

The Statement of Work is as follows:

Objective:

The continuing need within CFSAN to conduct organizational assessments and assist with facilitating a smooth transition to the newly established organizational structure for the Center and within a number of offices is extremely important at this time.  In addition consulting services are needed to support changing and expanding organizational responsibilities as priorities shift to address and establish new programs and activities  associated with the Food Protection Plan, the Import Safety Action Plan, the FDA Strategic Plan, the Memorandum of Agreement with China, the Secretary’s Prevention Plan and other major Center, Agency and Department initiatives. 

Scope of Work:

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials and services and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incident to the performance of the work as described below.

The Contractor shall work closely with the Director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, the CFSAN Deputy Directors, other members of the CFSAN Senior Leadership Team, the CFSAN Management Council, other CFSAN Managers and Supervisors and other designated officials.

The Contractor shall provide expert advice, consultation, assistance, guidance and counseling to support and/or improve management and organization planning and coordination efforts. This may involve individual and/or joint consultation sessions with managers, supervisors and staff.

The Contractor shall collect, review and analyze pertinent data on CFSAN management actions, goals and objectives and propose new approaches as appropriate to managers, supervisors and staff. 

      The Contractor shall conduct organizational assessments of current activities and ongoing programs as appropriate and provide a strategic action plan with milestones for proposed changes. Assessments should result in identifying needs and issues to be addressed along with recommendations for changes that will improve work processes within the established priorities.
      
      The Contractor shall conduct individual and joint consultations with the CFSAN Management Council, managers, supervisors, and staff as appropriate, to ensure a smooth transition to full implementation of the new organizational alignment including plans for establishing internal priority efforts to enhance management/employee relations for cross-cutting projects.

Summary Schedule of Report/Deliverables:

Summary Item	         Quantity	                            Due Dates
Quarterly Progress Report	          3 copies	          Quarterly (April, July, October)
Final Report	                               3 copies                                              May 1,2009	                                                                                       
Period of Performance:    April 30, 2008 to May 1, 2009

EVALUATION FOR AWARD
Basis for Award:

a.       Proposals received will first be evaluated from a technical standpoint without regard to proposed cost.    Those proposals considered to be technically acceptable will then be evaluated from a financial and management standpoint.

b.       Technical factors are significantly more important than cost or price.  It is pointed out, however, that should technical competence between offerors be considered approximately the same, then cost or price could become primary.

c.       FDA will base its award decision using a best value analysis that results in the most advantageous acquisition for the government.  FDA’s acquisition strategy used to obtain best value may result in an award to other than the lowest priced, technically rated offeror.  Best value analysis spans a continuum from the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal to those proposals in which tradeoffs between price, past performance, and each offeror’s technical solution is evaluated.  This tradeoff process (see FAR 15.101-1) depends on the government’s assessment of quality factors, including but not limited to past performance, compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence, management capability, personnel qualifications and prior experience, and price.

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:

Area	                                Details                                                          Percentage

The proposal must not merely repeat the “what” information (in the  same or a different order) presented by the government in the request for proposal.  The proposal must detail the “how” the contractor will complete the “what” required by the government. 	10%

Project Plan	

The project plan should demonstrate overall soundness, logical sequence, and procedures to assure addressing the changing needs of the organization at this time and document progress achieved in required deliverables and outputs outlined in the statement of work.

&#61656;	Identification of tasks;
&#61656;	Work breakdown schedule (planned interactions/meetings and next steps);
&#61656;	Estimated levels of effort (cost); and

Deliverables	

The proposal should provide a quarterly report on consultations, related meetings and progress with individuals or related organizational components.  Reports should adhere to the aforementioned confidentiality and privacy requirements.	                     15%

The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for film image scanning. The desired period of performance for the services described herein is anticipated to be 01 days after date of contract award and shall last for a period of 12 consecutive months. The services includes the contractor furnishing all labor, transportation, equipment, materials, supplies and supervision needed to perform image scanning from aerial film as described herein. This contract will include a base year and four one-year options. There will be no future synopsis in the event the options included in the contract are exercised. No new work can be issued after one year following award of initial contract unless an option year is exercised. 

The total contract value and cumulative delivery order issuances will not exceed $500,000.00. The procurement shall consist of services including image scanning for Kodak Aerocolor III negative (2444/SO-846) 9.5 inch film or equivalent. Orders will be made from either in entire film rolls or specifically identified frames within a film roll.  Order quantity is in varying amounts from 1 to 10,000 scans and can occur throughout the calendar year with the majority occurring during the summer months.  The magnitude of work is not accurately predictable due to the inability to forecast fire, weather, and insect/disease related forestry events in advance of their occurrence.

Pricing should be provided for each CLIN listed below as well as for each of the four option periods. Individual requested requirements include: CLIN 0001: Aerial film image scanning for Kodak Aerocolor III 2444/SO-846 9.5 inch film or equivalent. CLIN 0002: Aerial photograph titling 9.5 inch film. CLIN 0003:  Sample scan sets for Kodak Aerocolor III 2444/SO-846 9.5 inch film or equivalent.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  All developed aerial film shall be maintained free of chemicals, stains, tears, scratches, abrasions, watermarks, finger marks, lint, dirt, and cared for so that physical defects are avoided. The imagery shall be maintained clear and sharp and free from dust and scratches and other imposed defect. Film must be carefully cleaned before scanning so that the quality of the resulting scans is not impacted. Any marks placed on the film for titling or editing purposes shall be removed prior to scanning

The scan shall include the film image from edge to edge of the film and all fiducial marks associated with the image. The data block should be excluded from the scan. The scans shall be clear and sharp in detail with uniform density, and free from dirt and other defects in the digital imagery in accordance with the following requirements:

(a) Resolution. Aerial photography shall be scanned such that the final product results in a 600 dots per inch (40 microns) resolution or the resolution specified in the individual task order.

(b) Accuracy. The geometric accuracy of the scan shall be such that a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2 or less results when registering the calibrated fiducial marks to the scanned image.

(c) Histogram. The histogram of scanned images must represent all the pixels with the digital image without clipping highlight or shadow detail from the image.

(d) Color Requirements. Color balance is defined as balancing the color between the three primary colors and their complimentary secondary color. Red and cyan must be balanced. Green and magenta must be balanced. Blue and yellow must be balanced. Color saturation is achieved so that minimum colors do not look like a grayscale image and the maximum colors do not bleed into another area of the image. The scanned images shall capture red, green, and blue channels for both natural color and color infrared at 8-bits per channel.

File Format. Tagged Image Files (TIFF). Scanned files shall be submitted in accordance with the Baseline TIFF 6.0 file format as defined in the TIFF 6.0 Specifications. All baseline TIFF 6.0 files shall store data as uncompressed RGB full-color images as defined in the specification using the little-endian byte order and shall only contain one image file directory (IFD). All TIFF files submitted shall be readable by older applications that assume TIFF 5.0 or an earlier version of the specification. TIFFs that use designated Extended TIFF 6.0 file features shall not be acceptable. Features designated as not recommended for general data interchange are considered extensions to the Baseline TIFF 6.0 specifications, and will not be acceptable. This includes TIFFs that use one of the major new extensions such as tiled images. In the TIFF 6.0 specification, the term tag refers only to the identifying number, the term field refers to the entire field, including the value. Tags that are defined by the TIFF specification are called public tags and shall not be modified outside of the parameters given in the latest TIFF specification. Tags numbered 32768 or higher, sometimes called private tags, are reserved and shall not be acceptable. Enumeration constants numbered 32768 or higher are reserved and shall not be acceptable. Do not choose your own tag numbers, use only those specified in the Baseline TIFF 6.0 Specification for RGB full-color. Tags numbered in the reusable 65000-65535 range shall not be acceptable.

TITLING REQUIREMENTS:  Titling may or may not be required.  If required, the type of titling requirement (project or resource) will be supplied on each individual order. At a minimum titling will require that each exposure shall be clearly titled on the northern edge of the film, using standard block lettering 6.35 mm (1/4 inch) letters. The titling shall be sharp, legible, and uniformly applied with a non flaking black ink. 

SAMPLE SCANS:  Sample scans may or may not be required by the customer.  If ordered, the contractor shall be responsible for determining the format in which the scans are delivered to the Government.  The scans may be uploaded to a secure internet site or be submitted via some other media type.  The Government will not supply any storage media for sample scan requirements.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible quoters may submit a quote.  

The mission of the National Institute of Standard/Nanometer-Scale Dimensional Metrology Group/Precision Engineering Division, is to provide the foundation of dimensional measurements that meet the needs of the U.S. industrial and scientific communities by conducting research in dimensional measurements, developing measurement methods, providing measurement services and disseminating the resulting technology and length-based standards in the nanometer regime. The activity of the scanning electron microscope laboratory of the Nanoscale Metrology group has moved into new territories, and now it includes a series of new applications, which demands the highest performance from the instruments. The emerging nanotechnology requires the measurements of artifacts and calibration of relevant standards with truly nm sized features.

The best achievable resolution of any scanning electron microscope (SEM) is the most critical parameter that clearly sets apart various instruments. The importance of resolution lies in the fact that it allows for the distinction of various sample features. 

According to the Nyquist sampling theorem, to properly collect size and shape information on a 1 nm feature, at least 0.5 nm resolution is needed. In the presence of inevitable noise, this value must be even smaller. Without an SEM capable of less than 0.5 nm resolution it would be impossible to carry out the necessary calibrations and sample and calibration standards artifacts for nanotechnology.

The acquisition of a high-resolution scanning electron microscope is necessary to be able to conduct research on the truly nanometer-scale samples and perform dimensional measurements, certify standards artifacts with substantially less than one nm resolution.

This is a brand name or equal requirement.  Brand name or equal description is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agency’s requirement.  

All responsible quoters shall provide a quotation for all of the following line items:

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFQ 104068 and is being issued as a Request for Quote.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-24.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541512. The purpose of this Contract is to engage the services of a Contractor to support specific activities in the DCRI Scientific Computing Section (SCS) through the performance of the tasks listed and described below.  These tasks are divided into four major categories, namely Hardware, Software, Administrative and Collaboration
                                 
Summary

The Scientific Computing Section (SCS) is a component of the NIH Clinical Center that reports directly to the Chief Information Officer of the NIH Clinical Center.  SCS promotes the application of advanced computer science methods to the biomedical sciences. This Statement of Work calls for contractor support for a wide variety of SCS’s activities.


Background

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's foremost federally funded biomedical research institution. It has both intramural and extramural components.  The intramural component consists of twenty-seven Institutes and Centers, including the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.  This Clinical Center is now composed of two physically adjoining Clinical Centers that are clinical research hospitals providing medical services for inpatients and outpatients participating in human research protocols conducted by the intramural program of the NIH.  The Clinical Centers provide patient facilities as well as the general services necessary for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes.  They also conduct research in related areas of clinical medicine and supervise residency and other training programs.

The older of the two Clinical Centers is the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center.     This hospital facility is comprised of three million square feet of clinical, laboratory, and administrative space with the capacity to serve three hundred and fifty inpatients participating in research studies at the NIH.   Increasing demands for space, both for research and expanded services, coupled with the facility's advancing age, spurred development and construction of a new clinical research center, the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC), which opened in late 2004. The new CRC includes modern research facilities and a 220-bed hospital, outpatient care capability.

As part of the infrastructure for patient care, the Clinical Center upgraded its 30-year Medical Information System (MIS) to a best-of-breed Clinical Research Information System (CRIS), which went live in August 2004.  The CRIS project represents a comprehensive effort to modernize the systems that supports clinical care and the collection of research data for the intramural clinical research programs of the NIH.

The CRIS project has been under the direction of the Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) within the NIH Clinical Center.  DCRI has been responsible for processes and systems that directly affect users in the health care delivery and research settings. Work in DCRI has focused on the analysis and evaluation of clinical research computational needs and requirements, the development of design options that support the work processes of clinical research, and the implementation and management of responsive computer science methodology solutions.

The Scientific Computing Section

The Scientific Computing Section (SCS) reports directly to the Chief Information Officer of the NIH Clinical Center.  The SCS supports and promotes organizational goals by seeking and engaging in active collaborative work with CRIS clinical research protocol users as well as with other biomedical researchers within the NIH Intramural Program and with members of academia and industry.  In this work, knowledge in both the biomedical sciences and the computing sciences is advanced, and practical results that lead to better health care are realized.  Data mining – the exploration of data with intelligent computing tools to find new knowledge - is an important activity in the SCS.  The SCS directs and coordinates the NIH Biomedical Computing Interest Group (BCIG) which is one of the largest and most active of the 100+ special interest groups at the NIH.  Also, the SCS coordinates and manages a student program whereby students in the computational and biomedical sciences work together as teams to bring innovative biomedical computing methodology to medicine. The work described in this Statement of Work will be guided and performed under the auspices of the SCS


Contract Tasks   

This Contract calls for contractor support relating to certain activities in the DCRI Scientific Computing Section (SCS).  A major theme relating to all of these activities is “a multidisciplinary research team approach to biomedical data mining.” The concept “biomedical data mining” as used here is intended to convey the idea of utilizing captured biomedical scientific and administrative data to discover new knowledge, to confirm or refute tentative hypotheses, and/or to suggest new hypotheses worthy of exploring.  This is in contrast (but complementary to) the more traditional hypothesis driven paradigm typically the hallmark of biomedical research. “Multidisciplinary research team,” a concept inspired by the NIH Roadmap, suggests a team approach to data mining. Such teams may be comprised of biomedical research scientists, computer scientists, electrical engineers, statisticians, mathematicians, administrators, technical writers, intellectual property experts, etc.  In short, whatever skills needed to achieve rapid, high-quality results from data mining efforts would be assembled to work closely together under this multidisciplinary team model. The SCS directs and coordinates the NIH Biomedical Computing Interest Group (BCIG) which is one of the largest and most active of the 100+ special interest groups at the NIH.   The SCS also runs an active student program in which graduate and undergraduates students in computer science, engineering and the biomedical sciences work part time to advance the goals of the SCS.

There are four major task groups in which work is to be conducted under this Statement of Work.  These task groups are referred to as H=HARDWARE, S=SOFTWARE, A=ADMINISTRATIVE, and C=COLLABORATION.  All four task groups span over the entire Statement of Work period.  Since the work described here is primarily of a research nature, it is to be understood that more detailed definitions of specific tasks in these groups can only manifest and be made more explicit as work progresses.  It is also to be understood that the Contractor will work closely with the Project Officer to develop more specific task descriptions based on the experience and the knowledge gained as work progresses.

The four major task groups and their descriptions are as follows: 

    HARDWARE  (H):  This task group calls for general hardware support for installing, operating    
    and maintaining computer servers and providing audio-visual and Internet support as described 
    below:

R & D Servers: The SCS uses and maintains two (2) computer servers for on-going research and development purposes.  These machines provide data gathering and data preparation tools as well as file sharing and applications program development support. They are considered to be general purpose research and development servers and they are used to test new ideas that are intended to bring modern scientific computing to biomedical research and health care delivery. The laboratory instrument error reduction system and the idiopathic inflammatory disease system mentioned next under “Production Servers” were developed using these R & D servers.  A possible near future example is a “Virtual Biopsy” project which is intended to explore the possibility of eliminating the need for biopsies in certain areas of medicine by developing computer models that would use other patient information obtained less invasively to accurately predict biopsy outcome.

Production Servers: The SCS uses and maintains two (2) computer servers for new project development.  The evolving process is to develop the new projects utilizing the R & D servers described above and then transfer data and software to production servers.  They may be used to gather data from disparate sources (including CRIS) and to develop and test new applications programs for data mining and data visualization.  A past example of a production server is one developed in 2004 by SCS for the NIH Clinical Center Department of Laboratory Medicine (DLM) to capture, preserve, and run quality control and error reduction software on data collected from certain laboratory instruments in the DLM environment.  A more current on-going example is a system developed for the NIEHS for gaining a deeper understanding of idiopathic inflammatory diseases.  

            BCIG Support:  The SCS coordinates the NIH Biomedical Computing Interest Group (BCIG) which is one of the largest and most active of the 100+ special interest groups at the NIH.  Most BCIG events are webcast live, recorded, edited, and made available via the BCIG web site for post session viewing.  The contractor will be responsible for recording, editing and web site archiving BCIG programs.

            Web Site Development and Maintenance:  This hardware task group calls for support in all aspects of web site development and maintenance, particularly the NIH Biomedical Computing Interest Group (BCIG) web site.  Such services include but are not limited to all aspects of multi-media presentations, webcasting, podcasting and blogging.

            General Hardware Support:  This hardware task group refers to building, maintaining, and using additional hardware systems for a variety of general support services for SCS and the NIH Biomedical Computing Interest Group (BCIG) similar to the ones described above.

HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this project, interested parties must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration and demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a brief (20 pages or less) Technical and Cost Proposal by 2:00 PM, ET, April 30, 2008.  Technical proposals must include: (1) Specific approach in meeting requirements outlined in the Statement of Work and compatibility of system/process with existing agency configuration. (2) History (current or within the last 18 months) of projects similar in scope and nature, with specific references (including project identifier/contract number and description, period of performance, dollar amount, client name and current telephone number).  References will be checked to validate the information provided and to determine reliability/dependability.  (3) Key personnel (those who would have the primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the project) with relevant qualifications and specific experience. 
Cost Proposal:  provide Firm Fixed-Price “broken out by labor hours, labor category, materials, and other direct costs”. Offerors must submit an original and one copy of the proposal to HARVEY CAMEAU, USCG Headquarters Support Command, Code A-3, Room B411, 2100 Second St. SW, Washington, DC  20593.  Electronic transmissions to Harvey.Cameau@uscg.mil are acceptable, but must be timely.  

Proposal Evaluation Criteria: Proposals will be evaluated based on two criteria: (1) technical merit and (2) cost/price. Technical evaluations will be based on how the following subfactors are addressed in the proposal: 

Subfactor A: Overall Mission Understanding. The proposal must demonstrate understanding of the processes and procedures required for performing training support services for the Coast Guard’s Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Examiner Course.
Subfactor B: Proposed Management Plan.  The proposal must demonstrate understanding of the task order objectives and deliverables required.
Subfactor C: Quality Assurance. The proposal must demonstrate how the offeror expects to maintain the highest standards in the professional services delivered.
Subfactor D: Past Performance. The proposal must demonstrate present and past performance as it relates to the current proposal.

The second evaluation factor is cost/price. The Government may be willing to pay more than their estimated cost if a proposal’s advantages warrant it. However, as technical merit ratings equalize, price may become the deciding factor. Proposed costs and fees for all years will be evaluated as the total price proposal.

A team of technical personnel using a color rating format will evaluate the proposal to the technical criteria described below:

PURPLE- A proposal that demonstrates competence and far exceeds the minimum requirements of the criteria; has a high probability of success; contains no weaknesses or deficiencies;
GREEN- A proposal that demonstrates competence and exceeds the minimum requirements of the criteria; has an above average probability of success; contains no significant weaknesses and only minor, correctable weaknesses exist; 
BLUE- A proposal that meets in all aspects the minimum requirements of the criteria; has a good probability of success; no significant weaknesses and any deficiencies can be readily corrected; 
YELLOW- A proposal that fails to meet the minimum requirements of the criteria but may meet them through negotiations; low probability of success; major weaknesses and/or significant number of deficiencies exist that may be improved or corrected through discussions; or
RED- A proposal that fails to meet minimum requirements of the criteria; proposal needs major revisions; very low probability of success.

As used in this clause--Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options.

Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: (1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. (2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. (3) For long-term contracts- (i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and (ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the exercise date specified in the contract for any option thereafter.

The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/ . (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: The Contractor represents that it [ ] is, [ ] is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 334112assigned to contract number (Determined at Award).[Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].

Industry Week meetings are intended to ensure interested bidders have a clear and complete understanding of the Government's requirements.

Consistent with these two goals, the Government will entertain suggestions to revise, clarify, or simplify/streamline the requirements in the RFP documents.  We encourage the provision of these suggestions in an electronic form in advance of the Industry Week meetings, with the intent of facilitating productive discussions during the meetings.  Offerors are encouraged NOT to use the limited meeting time to "test" the Government's reactions to possible requirements solutions or approaches.  The Government's responses to such inquiries will be limited to non-evaluative discussion.  Capability briefings related to an offeror's specific training simulation technology capabilities across similar applications should be scheduled with the 677 AESG engineering leadership outside of the context of this solicitation. 20 Nov 07: Posted the Non-Disclosure Agreement for the AFRL Mission Essential Competencies (MECs).

<SOLNBR>CP-04-15
<RESPDATE>050508

<DESC>Proposed addition of Biobased Lubricant to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.

This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Biobased Lubricant by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Lubricant, Biobased, 3-in-1 Multi-Purpose 11 oz. & 18 oz.
8030-00-NIB-0004
8030-00NIB-0005
The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 6, Kansas City, MO.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Biobased Lubricant to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

8030-01-418-9008
WDF10011
WDF10032
CRC 03005
CRC 03003
CRC 03160
8030-01-439-0681
WDF10116
WDF-10016
WD 10024

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Biobased Lubricant to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than May 5, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

All offers shall be evaluated for fair and reasonable price, technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance, delivery schedule and adherence to the applicable clauses/provisions.  Notice to Offerers:  This procurement is part of the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System RED/Yellow/Green Program.  Award will be based on the contracting officer's decision as to which offer provides the best value to the Navy, price, past performance, and other factors considered.
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).  
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f! irst article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data.

The E-WPS will place potable water into bags ranging from 1 liter to 3 liters. These stand alone packaged bags can be used in the field for such duties as a source of re-supply for the existing Improved Load Bearing Equipment (ILBE) pack system Marine-on-the-move hydration system or distributed as stand alone packaged water for humanitarian relief missions.
It is desired that the E-WPS should produce 1500 3-liter bags in less than 2 hours. The E-WPS bag(s) should also be provided with a wide-mouthed cap and feature easy pour using a gloved hand. Note: The E-WPS bag is not intended for replacement of the hydration system bladder, but to serve as a source of water to refill the bladder.
The E-WPS needs to be rugged, automated, and skid mounted so that it can be integrated on a standard M1102H HMMWV trailer without exceeding the towing capacity of the HMMWV (the E-WPS and all associated equipment to be mounted to the trailer must not exceed 2740 pounds). 
Commercial firms possessing the characteristics noted in any of the above systems are encouraged and invited to submit product brochures and pricing materials outlining specifications, to include a statement of capabilities. Please notate if the product is offered on GSA Schedule.  Responses will be reviewed to identify firms potentially capable of fulfilling the Governments requirements. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for the information requested. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort. If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  Responses t! o this RFI shall be mailed to Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: Patty Pagonis CT 025 GTES, 2200 Lester Ave, Quantico, VA 22134-6050 on or before 16 May, 2008. FEDEX or UPS deliveries should be sent to MARCORSYSCOM Material Management, Attn: Patty Pagonis CT 025 GTES, 2201A Willis St, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.
