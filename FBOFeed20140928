<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE not a pre-solicitation notice or solicitation for proposals/quotations. Pursuant to FAR Part 10 (Market Research), the purpose of this notice is to determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exist. Pursuant to FAR Part 6 and FAR Part 19, competition and set-aside decisions may be based on the results of this market research. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. This notice in no way obligates the Government to any further action.<br /><br />This notice is issued by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), College Park, MD to identify sources capable of providing the following:<br /><br /><strong>REQUIREMENTS: </strong>NARA is seeking sources for the implementation of a previously developed plan to integrate and configure a Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) and HSPD-12 compliant single single sign-on (SSO) access control infrastructure for logical and physical access. The NARA network infrastructure includes an enterprise Identity Management System (IDMS) that provides a unified account management function for multiple systems. The current IDMS is based on NetIQ Identity Manager and is designed to provide authentication to eDirectory and Active Directory, and other Lightweight Directory Application Protocol (LDAP) compliant infrastructures within NARA's network environment. Therefore, the prospective contractor must be a certified NetIQ and Novell partner. Currently, HSPD-12-compliant PIV cards have been issued to NARA employees, through  the US Access, Managed Shared Service Offering (MSO) administered by the General Services Administration (GSA).
<p>Furthermore, NARA's current Human Resources Systems Shared Services Provider is the Human Resources Directorate of the Interior Business Center (IBC). The cards may be used to provide the authentication and authorization necessary to gain access to physical buildings, floors, and rooms as well as computers, applications and other computing systems. They are currently used for logical access by participants in the pilot project only. However, they have not yet been used for logical access to NARA information systems by all NARA end-users. The prospective contractor would be tasked with all aspects of the effort including the project management, technical, functional, and quality control activities at the level needed for the successful completion of this project.</p>
<p><strong><br />SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION:</strong> Companies having capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought notice including commercial market information and company information.

<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes: This Sources Sought Notice is for market research purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal/Quotation; and, it is not considered to be a commitment by the Government to award a contract nor will the Government pay for any information provided; no basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this Sources Sought Notice or Government use of any information provided.

Regardless of the information obtained from this Sources Sought Notice, the Government reserves the right to consider any arrangement as deemed appropriated for this requirement. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program. Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&A is not required for this award. <br>  <br> The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform the Invasive Species management services as defined in this Performance Work Statement (PWS), except for those items specified as Government furnished items and services.  The Contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.Task #1: Invasive Species Management.There are currently 8 species of noxious weeds identified on HAFB. These invasive species impact or have the potential to impact natural resources and mission capability.  Native vegetation community integrity and habitat functionality has been decreased, and as a result, wildlife habitat value has declined, due in part to the encroachment of invasive noxious weeds and ongoing drought conditions. This project will chemically treat invasive noxious weeds, including African rue, Malta star-thistle and Russian knapweed, and other species, if small new infestations are identified by HAFB Natural Resources Manager, as part of a comprehensive integrated Pest Management Program.This task consists of management of invasive salt cedar by manually and/or mechanically cutting using the cut-stump method and application of herbicide to all cut stumps, and sprouts.  The Contractor shall treat salt cedar within the designated locations on the map (Figure 1) as well as a Pupfish spring habitat near the Test Track where .  A considerable portion of the treatment area is adjacent to the  quote mark boundary quote mark  of wetlands, and will require personnel to use chainsaws and backpack spray equipment within the wetlands. The Contractor shall NOT enter water or designated wetlands with heavy equipment or vehicles. No soil movement or significant soil disturbance (beyond foot traffic) shall occur within the wetlands boundaries. The Contractor shall coordinate with the Holloman point-of-contact for clarification of work areas and any questions regarding access to areas. The Contractor shall stay on existing roads to access all work areas.  The Contractor shall also apply herbicide for African rue, which is typically found along disturbed roadways of the Base.	Manually and/or mechanically cut salt cedar using the cut-stump method in the following manner:a.   Manual Treatment: Manually (by hand using chainsaws or other hand equipment) cut salt cedar to the base of the tree in sensitive areas (adjacent to native vegetation, water and/or designated preserve locations) as designated by the Contracting Officer. Trees shall be cut as close to the ground as possible. No stumps may be left higher than 8 inches above the ground surface (except when  quote mark high-stumping quote mark  as needed). Tree material shall be piled in an adjacent area as designated by the Contracting Officer. <br> b.   Mechanical Treatment: Mechanically (with equipment) cut salt cedar to the base of the tree. Trees shall be cut as close to the ground as possible. No stumps may be left higher than 8 inches above the ground surface (except when  quote mark high-stumping quote mark  as needed). Tree material shall be piled in an adjacent area as designated by the Contracting Officer.c.   The Contractor shall backfill all resulting holes to original grade.d.   All stumps greater than 3-4 inches in diameter and any stems less than 3-4 inches in diameter shall be treated as described in the Herbicide section of this prescription. Root sprouts (resprouts) at a height of 2-4 feet and less that 4 inches diameter, shall be treated with herbicide as described below. <br> Herbicide Application:Herbicides shall be applied by a State Certified Herbicide Applicator, as applicable, in accordance with label. The Certified Applicator shall wear clothing and personal protective equipment as specified on the herbicide label. Water used for formulating shall only come from locations designated by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall not allow the equipment to overflow. Prior to application of herbicide, all equipment shall be inspected for leaks, clogging, wear, or damage, and shall be repaired prior to being used. <br> Herbicide formulations shall be mixed or poured into spray equipment within designated staging areas. These staging areas must be located away from the river floodplain, irrigation canals or locations where groundwater, irrigation water or drinking water could potentially become contaminated. For non-native species receiving cut-stump herbicide treatments, herbicide shall be applied to freshly cut stump surfaces within 15-20 minutes after cutting. Herbicide shall be applied using backpack spray units with appropriately outfitted wands and nozzles to assure direct contact with the target area of the stump and to avoid herbicide  quote mark drift quote mark . Herbicides will not be applied when winds exceed 15 miles per hour or when rain is forecasted for the local area within 48 hours of application. When Garlon-4 is used, it should not be used within a 20-ft buffer zone from areas where standing or flowing water is present; an aquatic-approved herbicide should be used within the 20-ft buffer zone. Documentation to fulfill the requirements of the HAFB pesticide management plan shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer prior to payment. <br> The Contractor shall apply herbicide to all cut stumps and/or root sprouts according to the following methods. Note that herbicide formulation requirement changes depending on the size of vegetation to be treated. Specific chemicals used should be directed by the HAFB POC and remain consistent with the HAFB and DOD Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan. Stumps Application Cut-stumps greater than 4 inches in diameter:   Apply herbicide directly to the stump within15-20 minutes of cutting the tree. In situations where the stump herbicide application cannot be applied within the recommended 15 minute time frame, individual and/or groups of stumps can be left  quote mark high-stumped quote mark  (2 feet or more above the ground) and then re-cut and sprayed later to facilitate herbicide uptake. Whip Application: Apply herbicide to root sprouts (new growth and/or re-sprouts, ~3 feet tall) less than 4 inches in diameter directly to the stem between 2 quote mark  and 18 quote mark  above the ground surface. The Contractor shall re-treat stumps that are missed during initial herbicide treatment following site inspections by the Government. Contractor shall perform follow-up herbicide treatment of any root sprouts that occur after the first growing season. The Contractor shall submit, in writing, a plan for treatment of the vegetation including exact methodology, herbicide to be used and proposed schedule.  The Contractor shall update the existing Environmental Protection Plan (EPP) for the project after notification of award. Other invasive species included on this project to be chemically treated are African rue and Malta star-thistle in locations outside the cantonment area on HAFB, as defined by the HAFB Natural Resources Manager.  The contractor shall chemically treat African rue and Malta star-thistle infestations in the northern portion of the main base (outside the base cantonment area) and the Boles Wells Water System Annex (well fields).  Treatment methods will include use of foliar treatment with imazapyr (i.e. Arsenal) for African rue, and glyphosate (i.e. Roundup Pro) for Malta star-thistle. Invasive plant species will have herbicide applied in the season (window of time) when treatment with herbicide is most effective.The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Pesticide General Permit (PGP) provides coverage to applicators whose actions result in a discharge of a pesticide to Waters of the United States. It has been determined that this project will require coverage under the PGP. HAFB will submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to EPA to gain coverage under this permit. HAFB is considered a large entity, as defined in Appendix A of the Pesticide General Permit. Thus, HAFB will prepare a Pesticide Discharge Prevention Plan (PDPP). The contractor shall comply with the PDPP and PGP. The contractor shall submit information to HAFB during the preparation of the PDPP and reporting requirements outlined in the PGP. Field work will occur when the NOI has been submitted and approved by EPA and the PDPP has been finalized. 	The Contractor shall, without additional expense to the government, be responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses and permits, and for complying with and federal, state, and local laws, codes, and regulations, applicable to the performance of this work. The Contractor shall provide their own storage and comply with all chemical storage requirements.  A NPDES NOI will be obtained by HAFB.  The project manager applying herbicides must be a New Mexico state certified pesticide applicator in the appropriate categories (5, Aquatic; 6, Right-of-Way). All chemical applications shall be documented and reported monthly by the 5th calendar day to the 49 CES/CEIE (Entomology Shop), using the form provided by the POC (49CES/CEIE: Bergren).  The contractor shall use herbicides approved by ACC Command Entomologist for use on HAFB. Products not currently approved for use on the installation must receive Command Entomologist approval.Deliverables shall include (in electronic format): <br> The Contractor shall provide drafts of all annual reports to USACE PM and HAFB POC on CD-ROM. USACE and HAFB will have up to a 60-day review period to review each draft and prepare comments.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program. Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&A is not required for this award. <br>  <br> The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform the Storm and Waste Water Monitoring Program Compliance Support services as defined in this Performance Work Statement (PWS), except for those items specified as Government furnished items and services.  The Contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.Task #1a:  Storm Water Monitoring Support, Multi-Sector General Permit for Industrial Activities <br> This task involves the collection and visual analysis of storm water samples from a qualifying storm event during each of the four quarterly periods for five sector sample stations, sample collection and laboratory analysis of three background sampling stations and reporting.  The specifics of these tasks are discussed as follows:   <br> Sample Station Locations <br>  	Background Locations:  Background sample stations to be determined by 377 MSG/CEAN. <br>  	Outfall A:  Small Arroyo just north of the Trestle Site and east of the Hot Pad and south of Pennsylvania Street.  <br>  	Outfall B:  Inflow into South Gate Road Retention Basin. <br>  	Outfall C:  Drainage west of Ammo Rd. & southeast of LF-01. <br>  	Outfall D:  Small Arroyo just southwest of active C&D Landfill (LF-268). <br>  	Outfall E: In ditch along Demolition Range Road at west side of 30 quote mark  culvert; EOD Range drainage. <br> One storm water sample from each sample location (excluding the background sample locations: background locations will only require two quarters of sampling per location) shall be collected during the four quarterly sampling periods.  If no qualifying storm event occurs during a specific quarter or if a sample is not collected at a given location (due to low or no flow), a substitute sample during the next qualifying storm event must be collected. The required number of samples must be achieved. Background Monitoring- Collect a minimum of one grab sample from three stations during two quarterly monitoring periods (total of six samples).  The sample is to be collected from a discharge resulting from a measurable storm event and that occurs at least 72 hours from the previously measurable storm event (the required 72-hour storm event interval may be waived under certain circumstances).  The grab sample must be collected within the first 30 minutes of a measurable storm event. If it is not possible to collect the sample within the first 30 minutes of a measurable storm event, the sample must be collected as soon as practicable after the first 30 minutes and you must document why it was not possible to take samples within the first 30 minutes. The 72-hour (3-day) storm interval does not apply if you document that less than a 72-hour (3-day) interval is representative for local storm events during the sampling period. When adverse weather conditions prevent the collection of samples during the quarter, you must take a substitute sample during the next qualifying storm event. Samples must be analyzed consistent with 40 CFR Part 136 analytical methods and using test procedures with quantitation limits at or below benchmark values for all benchmark parameters for which KAFB is required to sample. All samples must meet the constituent hold times. <br> Visual Analysis - Collect a minimum of one grab sample per unit during each quarterly monitoring period (excluding the background sample locations).  Following storm water sample collection, visually analyze the sample from each location.  The examiner shall document observations of color, odor, clarity, floating solids, settled solids, suspended solids, foam, oil sheen, and other obvious indicators of storm water pollution.  The visual examination must be made during daylight hours. When adverse weather conditions as described in Part 4.2.3 of the MSGP prevent the collection of samples during the quarter, you must take a substitute sample during the next qualifying storm event. Documentation of the rationale for no visual assessment for the quarter must be provided for each outfall. Your visual examinations must be made on samples collected within the first 30 minutes of when the runoff or snowmelt begins discharging from the facility. If it is not possible to collect the sample within the first 30 minutes of discharge, the sample must be collected as soon as practicable after the first 30 minutes and you must document why it was not possible to take samples within the first 30 minutes. <br> Field Records - Record the sample collection date and time, sample collection location, visual assessment date and time for each sample, personnel collecting the sample and performing visual assessment and their signatures, nature of discharge (i.e., runoff or snowmelt), results of observations of the storm water discharge, probable sources of any observed storm water contamination, the duration (in hours) of the storm event sampled, rainfall total or snowmelt measurements or estimates (in inches) of the storm event that generated the sampled runoff, the duration between the storm event sampled and the end of the previous measurable storm event (in days), and the estimated total volume (in gallons) of the discharge sampled. Submit all collected background samples for laboratory analysis outlined in Table III.A-1. Records of monitoring information must also include the date(s) analyses were performed, the individual(s) who performed the analyses and the analytical techniques or methods used. The contractor is responsible for all costs associated with sample collection materials and supplies, sample shipment, and laboratory analysis. Sample collection information discussed above (Sample Collection and Analysis item 2 and 3), shall be summarized in narrative and provided for each outfall. A report (electronic copy) that includes the analytical reports including QA/QC and all other required information shall be submitted to the email address shown below no later than 5 calendar days following receipt of laboratory results for each sampling event and no later than 35 calendar days following sample collection.During the contract period, the contractor will be required to maintain the equipment at the five sector sample stations and the three background sample stations pursuant to manufacture specifications to ensure proper operation and effective collection of storm water samples.  This also includes purchase and installation of various sample collection station wear items/parts required to keep the units in working order.  The contractor must retain records of all calibration and maintenance records and all original strip chart recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation and provide the records as requested.  Prior to initiating sampling on this contract and between sampling events, the contractor shall perform the following specific preventative maintenance items at each of the five statationary sample stations and the one portable sample station: <br>  	thoroughly clean and decontaminated the 2.5 gallon polyethylene sample bottle <br>  	thoroughly clean rain gauge <br>  	thoroughly clean accumulated dust and debris from the inside of the fiberglass storm box <br> Following collection of a sample from a given location, the contractor shall conduct all maintenance required (cleaning of sample collection devices, cleaning of hoses, etc.) to prepare the unit for the next sampling event. <br> Task #2:  Waste Water Monitoring Support <br> The contractor will provide all labor, equipment, and supplies required to provide laboratory services for analysis of wastewater samples. <br> The contractor shall provide: Sample containers (with required sample preservatives) and supplies needed for each sampling event.
