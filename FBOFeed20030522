<DESC>The Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation, Administration for Children and Families (ACF) has a requirement to conduct evaluations of the implementation and impact of community-level initiatives to promote healthy marriage.  These initiatives may include services to improve marriage quality and stability, changes to state and community marriage policies, media campaigns and other marriage-related strategies. The initiatives will be directed by community-based coalitions of government agencies, nonprofits and faith-based organizations.  At several of the sites, states will be implementing section 1115 child support demonstrations as part of the initiative. 

It is intended that implementation and impact analyses will be conducted at up to 8 Community Healthy Marriage Initiative (CHMI) sites and implementation-only evaluations at up to 4 additional sites.  This will be accomplished though studying and recommending appropriate community healthy marriage sites for participation in the evaluation, designing and refining evaluation strategies, collecting administrative and survey data, conducting the evaluation research and analysis, and providing reports and briefings on the evaluation findings.

Since the interventions will be at the community level, the evaluation is expected to determine the impact on the community as a whole (or relevant subpopulations) using data available from secondary sources at the community level.  The evaluation will determine whether conditions in the community have changed in a way that would promote healthy marriages, and family and child wellbeing.  Additionally, the evaluation will involve analyses using data from surveys of populations targeted by the interventions to determine the impacts on these populations.  At the section 1115 child support sites, the evaluation will include child support measures, such as whether there was an increase in the percentage of cases with collections and an increase in the paternity establishment.

This procurement is full and open competition.  The procurement contains an evaluation factor for SDB participation.  The Government anticipates making a single award to be effective September 30, 2003, using a cost reimbursement arrangement.  The contract will have a seven-year period of performance.  In addition to the core project, the contract will include options to 1) add an additional five sites; and 2) fund services and programmatic activities at up to 12 CHMI evaluation sites.  Solicitation 233-03-0035 will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities website approximately 15 days after publication of this notice.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Pressure Transducers for RL10 Testing. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase Pressure Transducers for RL10 Testing from Stellar Technology Inc., pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: (a) These time critical items are to be used for the RL10 Test and need to be at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) as soon as possible to be serviced and installed in their respective systems to support and keep the required test schedule.  Putting said items out for bid would delay test schedule and test results by weeks or even months and subject the test program to cancellation.  (b) Based on the market research conducted by this office, these pressure transducers were the only ones found that could meet the specific form, fit, and function of existing instrumentation in pre-existing instrumentation racks.  Using any other pressure transducer would cause excessive rewiring that would further delay and impact this critical test schedule. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on May 30, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a Direct Acting Solenoid Valve. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase a Direct Acting Solenoid Valve from ValveTech, Inc., pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: (a) The requested item will be used for engineering conceptual and development system testing for the purpose of defining system requirements for the Aerojet Reaction Control Engine (RCE) risk reduction for the Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) Project.  (b) MSFC has a past history with this vendor supplying items of the same materials and construction as the requested products, and data collected on these items played a role in selecting this vendor for the requested product.  Selection of any other valve would unnecessarily delay tests required to define the system requirements needed to complete the NGLT Aerojet RCE risk reduction effort.  (c) The performance of the requested product during the development testing is not intended to identify this vendor as a supplier for the “flight” system, the only intention is to provide MSFC with a necessary part for performing the system tests, while providing equivalent operating characteristics similar to the main injector valve planned for use on the RCE.  (d) Delivery lead times on all components are critical to support system testing deadlines.  The requested products can be received in time to meet these deadlines.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on May 30, 2003.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation Office of Legislative and Public Affairs intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the complete research, treatment, scripting and production of a 20-25 minute video on the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the associated astrophysics.   BACKGROUND;  For many years, telescopes that detect and measure electromagnetic waves, including visible light, have been the primary means for astronomers and physicists to study the universe. LIGO is enabling scientists to reach out with an entirely new means of exploration—detectors of gravitational waves. The LIGO project is spearheading the completely new field of gravitational wave astronomy and opening a new window on the universe. LIGO may ultimately take us farther back in time than we’ve ever been, catching, perhaps, the very first murmurs of the universe in formation.  For more information on LIGO please visit http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/.   SCOPE OF REQUIREMENT; NSF seeks to produce a creative, entertaining video that will inform and educate the general public on the importance and relevance of the LIGO effort.  Because LIGO will be at the forefront of discovery, it has great potential to inspire young minds—and minds not so young. LIGO will bring us new knowledge, but its rarer gift may be to open up our imaginations. This, then, is not a simple educational video. It is a story about the drama of the scientific quest, about grand vision and optimism, about doing it right. The video must tell the story in a way that is compelling, entertaining, inspiring and intelligible to a wide variety of audiences. This procurement is issued on a competitive basis to qualified small businesses.  All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer in response to the RFP, which shall be considered by the agency.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor a Request for Proposal.  No contract will be awarded resultant of this notice.  Oral communications and facsimile responses are not authorized, all questions must be submitted electronically to the National Science Foundation, Attn: Jamala A. Jones, Contracting Officer, Division of Acquisition and Cost Support, at jajones@nsf.gov.  The anticipated contract start date will be the first part of September 2003.  The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about the end of June 2003 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about the end of July 2003.

<DESC>The Government intends to conduct an economic feasibility study for utilities privatization to determine whether it is economically feasible to negotiate and award a contract to privatize the natural gas utility distribution system at F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming, which would include granting access and transferring ownership to the system.  If the study results in a favorable economic determination, a contract will be awarded for up to fifty (50) years for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the utility distribution system, with access granted through execution of a Right of Way, and with transfer of title occurring through execution of a Bill of Sale.  The O&M contract will be governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The transfer of property and granting of access is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2688.  The natural gas utility distribution system at F.E. Warren AFB, WY supports 6,500 people, 5,866 acres, and 800 buildings comprised of 4.41 million square feet.  The successful offeror will be required to comply with all service distribution requirements outlined in the solicitation, to obtain all applicable permits, licenses and certifications necessary for performance, and to possess the financial resources necessary to provide utility distribution system operation and maintenance, as well as required capital improvements.  In order to be considered for contract award, non-regulated utilities will be required to obtain performance bonds.  The contract value rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate is $3,183,253 for one year and $11,835,312 for fifty years.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for additional expert, technical and administrative support to the Columbia Accident Investigative Board. NASA LaRC intends to procure these services via a modification to an existing GSA MOBIS schedule order with Valador, Inc. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Valador, Inc. as the only known source who can meet agency requirements pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). The continuation of required support services to the CAIB is available only from the original source, Valador, as a follow-on for these highly specialized services as the award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and will result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.	Valador, their subcontractors, experts and consultants are providing expert services in ceramics processing, flight safety, hypersonic aerothermodynamics, materials forensics, micrometeoriod protection and orbital debris, sensor analysis, forensics, metallurgy, plasma, computational fluid dynamics and event reconstruction to the CAIB. A disruption of these technical services would seriously impact the CAIB's ability to complete their independent inquiry and determine the cause of the accident as soon as practical. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 30, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Quoters are required to provide a complete breakdown of prices submitted for each CLIN. 
The Department of Navy in general and the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) in particular, are going through a period of radical change, known as transformation.  NAVSUP is responsible for changing the way they deal with their customers, changing the way they deal with their major functions, reducing the infrastructure, changing business process and service delivery models, changing the organizational alignment, and changing the tools use to perform daily tasks.

The contractor will be required to: develop a change management project plan of all required actions to provide NAVSUP the necessary process for change management for the current transformation efforts and for future changes; assess the current human landscape to determine the organization’s overall capacity to change, which should include an assessment of the risk of not implementing change management; develop a plan to mitigate the risks and exploit the opportunities identified during the assessment phase which should have specific actions and milestones identified and a way to assess progress; assist in implementing the above plan to include services that  coach the NAVSUP change management team on how to implement the plan, train the change management team in change management elements and steps, and provide the change management team with the tools and techniques required to make the organization more adaptable for the current change being implemented and for future change; develop and implement a knowledge transfer plan to leave with the NAVSUP change management team that ensures change management is embedded into the future project management process.

The Contractor shall provide the following deliverables:
- Change Management Project Plan - required 20 days after contract award.
- Change Management Team Charter - required 40 days after award.
- Report on results of assessment to include rating of risk factors and required actions to mitigate the risks - required 60 days after award.
- Plan to mitigate the risks and exploit the opportunities identified during the assessment phase - required 80 days after award.
- Knowledge Transfer Plan - required 100 days after award.
- Report on the status of implementing the Change Management Project Plan - Biweekly after plan is delivered and accepted.

The Government will provide the following information/access: access to applicable documents; access to various transformation personnel including Assistant Chiefs of Staff, Functional Leads, Public Affairs personnel, Field Commanding Officers and Executive Directors, first line supervisors, and other personnel in the Enterprise affected by transformation; access Badges for individuals on site; desk space when on site; telephone when on site.

The majority of work will be performed in Mechanicsburg, Pa.  However, travel to other Enterprise locations will be required.  It is anticipated that two visits (not to exceed one week per visit) will be required to each of the following areas:  Philadelphia PA, Norfolk VA, Jacksonville, FL, San Diego CA, Puget Sound WA, Honolulu HI, Washington, DC, and Yokosuka, Japan.

The RFQ contemplates a firm fixed price contract, with the effort to be completed not later than  (9) months after award.  The requirement is being solicited through this combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Award will be made to the eligible, responsible quoter whose quote, conforming to the RFQ, represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors in the RFQ.  The RFQ will require the submission of: Price, Corporate Experience, Technical Approach, and Past Performance information, with the technical information considered more important than price.  

The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Quoters – Commercial Items, is applicable with the Technical Information being evaluated as more important than price.  The technical evaluation factors are listed as follows, and are of equal importance: Corporate Experience, Past Performance, and Technical Approach.  

In its technical submission, under Corporate Experience, the quoter shall demonstrate corporate experience in Change Management as the primary product of the Contractor’s business.  Under Technical Approach the quoter should describe the company’s plan to successfully accomplish all requirements of the SOW.  The technical approach should identify and describe the steps in the assessment, planning, and implementation of the Change Management program.

THEREFORE OFFERORS INITIAL PROPOSALS SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERM.  This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor.  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction and renovation by design-build or (to a lesser extent) design-bid-build of Fire Protection works at various locations within the Southwest Division area of responsibility, including but not limited to, Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico.

In support of design-build strategies, each Offeror shall possess in-house capabilities or employ the services of a Lead Design Firm (A-E) experienced in the design development and coordination of projects within the scope of this contract.  Offerors may offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s).  The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team.  Lead Design Firm(s) (A-E), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project.  After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.  Should any of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded task orders.  The basic contract period will be for 12 months (or earlier as determined by the Contracting Officer after the government orders the maximum per contract amount of $3,000,000).  Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months or a value of $3,000,000, whichever occurs first.  The task order range for this contract is between $50,000 and $3,000,000.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered to each awardee, under the basic performance period of the contract.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Two Phase Design-Build procedures of FAR 36.3 will be used for this procurement.  Phase One of the solicitation is in accordance with FAR Part 36.3.  Phase One evaluation will result in a determination of the most highly qualified Offerors.  These Offerors will be requested to submit a Phase Two proposal.  The maximum number of Offerors that will be selected to submit a Phase Two proposal is eight (8).  Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals by the Offerors selected in Phase One, which will be evaluated separately in accordance with Part 15.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  The Government reserves the right to substitute or add other Design-Build projects that meet the scope of the MACC, prior to the receipt of Phase Two proposals.  Selection for award will be based evaluation of the following:  Phase One:  Factor 1 - Past Performance of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 2 – Experience of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 3 - Technical Approach.  Phase Two:  Factor 4 - Engineering Solutions of Offeror's Team; Factor 5 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Electromagnetic Technology Division proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Regents of the University of Colorado, Office of Contracts and Grants, Boulder, CO 80309-0572 to provide a design for building a testing facility of detector arrays.  The skills of the researchers engaged by the University of Colorado are uniquely qualified for this work. Because of the high level of integration required between the test platform and the existing cryostat it is critical to have the designer in close proximity to the Boulder Labs.  NIST requires designs for a cryogenic facility for the dark testing of a large-format array of submillimeter wavelength bolometers.  The test facility will mount inside an existing adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) which will be used to cool the test facility to 100 mK.  The design must provide the following features: 1.  Low stray light.  The stray light from external 4K surface outside of the test facility must be attenuated by at least a factor of 10,000.  2.  Large wiring count.  The arrays requires 216 connections (signal and return) with many requiring a bandwidth in excess of 1 Mhz.  These signals must be routed from a 4K connector into the test facility with low loss, while not interfering with light and magnetic shielding or causing large thermal conduction to the 4K stage.  3.  Large area chip mounting.  The detector chip dimensions are approximately 40 mm by 45 mm, and the chip dissipates roughly 200 nW when fully biased.  The dark testing facility must provide for detector chip heat sinking with less than a 5 mK temperature difference at the base temperature of 50 mK.  4.  Magnetic shielding.  The test facility must provide for an ambient magnetic field of less than 50 mG during cooling from room temperature to 4K and must provide superconducting magnetic shielding to temperatures below 4K.  5.  Low thermal conduction.  The extra load presented to the ADR by the test facility (including electrical or mechanical connections and detector bias power) must not exceed 400 nW at the base operating temperature of 50 mK.  The design work will take three phases: data collection, preliminary design, and final design.  The data collection phase requires studying our existing refrigerator, mechanical support, wiring, detector chips and other items in order to be able to design a test facility to meet all requirements.  The preliminary design will then be created and reviewed and lastly the final design will be created and reviewed by NIST staff.***This procurement is being conducted per Simplified Acquisition Procedures FAR Part 13 (under $100,000). FAR Clauses in full text are at  http://www.ARNET.gov/far.  This synopsis is issued for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, Acquisition of Commercial Items and Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with ASI Applied Systems Inc., a Mettler Toledo company, for a MultiMaxIR Automatic Multiple Reactor System.  This reactor system will be used to support the Green Chemistry and Engineering Program of the Agency's National Risk Management Research Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Said research program is directed towards the development of pollution prevention strategies for use within the chemical synthesis industry. To date, the research program has been focused on the development and design of green catalysts for the oxidation of hydrocarbons.  There is currently a need to identify and understand the true mechanism of the catalytic reaction.  Since the reaction occurs at elevated temperatures and pressures, the ability to perform in situ analysis would allow the researchers to identify the key mechanism(s) under real-time and real-environment conditions.  This necessitates infrared sensor technology that can withstand a wide variety of chemistries (acidic, basic, corrosive, toxic, etc.) and physical conditions (temperatures, pressures, etc.).  Sampling technology is a critical parameter for successful in situ reaction analysis.   The Mettler Toledo MultiMaxIR Automatic Multiple Reactor System uniquely meets the analytical and research needs of EPA's Green Chemistry and Engineering Program.  The system must be able to independently control and monitor multiple pressure reactions in situ and in real-time without the need to open the reaction vessels.  It is also critical that a single vendor be responsible for support of the entire reaction analysis system (hardware, software, support and service).  Because the sampling technology is fundamentally linked to the operation of the FTIR interferometer, all components of the optical system must be supplied by one vendor.  In addition, the FTIR portion must be fundamentally linked to the operation of the parallel automated laboratory reactor system comprising either ambient pressure or pressure vessels.  The referenced Mettler Toledo system is the only known system which can meet these requirements.       THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Documentation must be received not later than 15 calendar days after the posting date of this notice in order to be considered by the EPA.  The documentation must establish that the company can meet the requirements identified above.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Written responses shall be submitted to Garry Plear at the above address or by fax to (513)487-2107 or by e-mail to Plear.Garry@epa.gov to receive consideration for this acquisition.  Telephone responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Contracting Office in Budapest, Hungary, intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for USAID/Albania to solicit proposals from qualified organizations interested in implementing the Albania Enterprise Development and Export Market Services (EDEM) project. The project is aimed to accelerate Albania’s full entry into the global market.  EDEM will contribute to two interrelated objectives: (i) Promote competitiveness of small and medium enterprises (SME) in domestic and foreign markets, and (ii) Accelerate entry of Albanian agricultural and manufactured exports into global markets. The scope of work is divided into three phases, starting with a Rapid Launch period of four months to establish immediate momentum for the project.  The second phase will continue long-term implementation over the following 32 months. After an evaluation, a decision will be made whether to extend the project for an additional 24 months to continue specific aspects of the project.  The phases are: (A) Phase I: Launch Period (within first four months) - Tasks: 1) Agricultural Export Transaction Packaging; 2) Agricultural Export Market Development; 3. Competitive Assessment of Non-Agricultural SME. (B) Phase II: Long-Term Implementation - Tasks: 1) Develop Cluster Action Plans; 2) Competitive Business Environment; 3) Competitive Enterprises. (C). Phase III: Optional Extension. The planned contract is a cost plus fixed fee completion type. The EDEM will be managed under a results-based contract.  The government estimate for the contract is $6.5 million for the base 3-year period. Project funding in year one will total approximately $2.4 million with funding levels over years two and three expected to be slightly below the year one level. For the 2-year option, it is estimated $1.5 to $2.million per year, subject to availability of funds.  The RFP is expected to be issued about early June, 2003, and proposals will be due no later than the closing date in the RFP.  It will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration. Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued and posted on the website along with the RFP. Offerors are encouraged to check the FedBizOps website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) periodically.  Potential offerors may submit questions in writing, either by fax or email (Email preferred)  to Ms. Riana Napitupulu, Contract Specialist at the Regional Services Center, Regional Contracting Office, Budapest, Hungary:  at rnapitupulu@usaid.gov or via fax (36)(1) 475-4988 or 475-4991.  The deadline for receipt of questions and/or requests for clarifications is June 23, 2003.  Please do not contact USAID/Albania directly, since all communication must be through the RCO/Budapest. Thank you for your interest in USAID programs.

<DESC>The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), an independent Federal agency, is seeking sources to provide currently available Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) integrated loan origination and processing solutions that have the technical and functional capabilities, described below, and that have the flexibility to expand as the agency’s information needs and product lines grow.

OPIC tracks loans and investment funds in several systems, including a legacy system (converted from the WANG into APPX), and several MS Access databases and MS Excel spreadsheets.  The existing finance information architecture supporting our financials is not integrated, making it difficult to extract decision support and portfolio tracking information.  A fully integrated loan origination, loan processing, and general subledger COTS product will replace the existing finance information architecture and will allow the agency to view and track its financial portfolio without manual intervention.  OPIC also desires to make use of today's technology and business workflow capabilities for both its internal and external systems users.
	
The preferred COTS solution will capture and track information from the following phases of the loan lifecycle:

§	Origination (starting with receipt of a loan application, through the approval process to loan commitment/agreement phase) 
§	Processing (amortization schedules, invoicing, portfolio management) 
§	Accounting (disbursements, payables, cash receipts, journal vouchers) 
§	Monitoring (covenants, tracking loan performance)

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This synopsis is being amended.  Three optional maintenance periods of one year each are now included in the requirement.  A bidder's meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday June 10th at 1:00 PM est in Ann Arbor, MI.  The solicitation will be issued by May 29, 2003. In accordance with FAR Part 12 procedures, the EPA intends to procure one (1) Medium Duty Four Wheel Drive Dynamometer for Office of Air and Radiation/Laboratory Operations Division.  The four wheel drive electric chassis dynamometer will be located in a newly-developed test site at the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, MI.  As a part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, federal regulations for exhaust emissions and fuel economy of motor vehicles specify tests using chassis dynamometers to duplicate the forces encountered by a vehicle moving on a road by modeling those characteristics with a stationary vehicle on a rotating surface.  The new dynamometer will provide EPA with additional testing capabilities to support both current and future regulations as well as a range of evaluation and development activities.   	This dynamometer will be used to test a wide range of vehicles including front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, four wheel drive and all wheel drive with the full range of powertrain technology including those providing energy conservation through regenerative braking.  These vehicles will include those powered by some combination of internal combustion engines, electric motors and storage devices, hydraulics and hydraulic storage systems and fuel cells.  	 In general the dynamometer shall incorporate the following general features for testing these vehicles: accurate and precise road load determination and simulation; vehicle loading applied to the tires by 48" diameter rolls connected to intermediate motor/absorbers on a per axle configuration that contacts each vehicle tire; capability of testing all light duty vehicles, medium-duty passenger vehicles and  complete heavy duty vehicles up to 14,000 GVW, in two wheel drive and four wheel drive configurations, in a weight range of 1,000 to 14,000 pounds; roll sets which operate with synchronous speeds; operation under various ambient conditions.      	The intended test site at NVFEL is a new facility intended to provide a wide range of test capabilities.  The room's nominal measurements are 25'W x 75'L x 24'H with a clear height of 20' to the bottom of the 4' girder trusses.  This room will contain a dynamometer pit that has inside dimensions of 15' W x 55' L x 9' D located about 10 feet from each end.  This pit contains a thick reinforced floor capable of supporting the dynamometer  machinery. Adjacent is a 20' x 25' x 10' control room that will have a concrete structural deck surface for equipment. Construction of this new test facility began on April 2, 2003 with a projected completion date of January, 2004. 	The EPA is seeking to purchase a dynamometer system that will perform and collect data at the highest precision and accuracy with a high level of certainty, in a manner that can be comprehensively demonstrated and documented.  All equipment and all functions performed by the dynamometer system must be in accordance with the vehicle emissions testing and fuel economy-testing requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations.   The successful contractor shall also abide and comply with all building and safety codes specified in the EPA Facility Manual and by ASME, AISC, NEC, OSHA, BOCA, and NFPA wherever they apply.  	This procurement will be made using  "Best Value" evaluation criteria through Full and Open Competition for all elements of the Statement of Work.  The solicitation should be issued by May 13, 2003 at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  A "DRAFT" of the proposed Statement of Work for this requirement can be found at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  Interested parties are invited to review the "DRAFT" SOW and provide any comments or request a copy of the solicitation in writing to Emily Marcil at the above address, by fax at (513) 487-2107, or by e-mail at Marcil.Emily@epa.gov. by May 6, 2003. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  EPA anticipates award of the contract by July 15, 2003.

<DESC>The Library of Congress has a requirement for contract services to provide a Cost Benefit Analysis to identify alternative solutions for the HRMS functionality in the areas of recruitment, classification and performance management to augment the PeopleSoft delivered capabilities. The successful offeror  will review existing documentation and conduct interviews to gain a understanding of the current business processes related to the HRMS functionality in the areas of recruitment, classification and performance management.  A focus must be made especially on those requirements that differ from those provided in the PeopleSoft HRMS Release 8.x and those that differ from standards adhered to by other federal government agencies.  The successful offeror will review our current implementation of PeopleSoft HRMS release 7.0 to further identify requirements and compare with the enhanced functionality of PeopleSoft HRMS Release 8.x.  The information gathered will serve as a baseline from which we can identify and evaluate alternative solutions, including but not necessarily limited to, third party bolt-on software applications and customizations of the as-is delivered functionality of PeopleSoft HRMS 8.x.  We want three alternatives identified to consider, one of which should be the current application being used for recruitment, classification and performance management. The identified alternatives will be matched against the requirements to assess how each alternative meets the requirement and where remaining gaps may exist.  A cost estimate for each alternative is required and must be quantified.  The resulting document will provide us with information with which to make an informed decision regarding the most beneficial alternative.  It also will provide cost information in sufficient detail to support the request for funding to carry out the selected alternatives(s).  Please provide resumes. All parties must submit proposals by email adoz@loc.gov or fax at 202-707-8611 not later than May 28, 3003 by 12:00 pm.



		
			STATEMENT OF WORK
                    Human Resources Cost Benefit Analysis



BACKGROUND

Currently HRS has implemented PeopleSoft HRMS Release 7.0 to support our needs for automation of personnel action requests.  We have identified a need to upgrade this version of PeopleSoft HRMS 7.0 to a Release 8.x or higher and we are interested in investigating options for replacing certain functionality contained in the as-delivered HRMS product with other third-party applications integrated with the HRMS application.   HRS will also consider modifications to the delivered HRMS as another alternative.  The purpose of these enhancements, whether by customization or third-party applications, is to better meet the requirements of the Library in carrying out our HR mission and to facilitate the Library's overall goal to move to the digital era and make greater use of web enabled technologies.  

SCOPE OF WORK

The Library of Congress requires contract services to identify alternative solutions for the HRMS functionality in the areas of recruitment, classification and performance management to augment the PeopleSoft delivered capabilities.  The results will be documented in a Cost-Benefit and Alternatives Analysis report. 

DELIVERABLE

The successful offeror shall deliver to the Library a Cost-Benefit and Alternatives Analysis documentation template and format on/before July 7, 2003:


AWARD
	
Award will be based on technical acceptability and price.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

Date of Award  thru July 7, 2003

The Technical Evaluation Factors are listed as follows:

1.  Demonstrated knowledge of web-based products and alternatives used by federal agencies to accomplish core human resources activities.

2.  Demonstrated experience in conducting cost-benefit analyses for federal agencies, with particular emphasis on such analyses involving human resources activities.

3.  Understanding of the Library of Congress' technical infrastructure that will be used to support future web-based human resources activities.

An unacceptable rating on any one factor will be a cause for an unacceptable rating for the entire proposal.

NOTICE
for
Smithsonian Website/Multimedia "Pro Bono" Development

1.	General.  The Smithsonian Institution was created by Act of the United States Congress in 1846 to carry out the terms of the Will of James Smithson who bequeathed the means to found a national institution based in Washington dedicated to  ?the increase and diffusion of knowledge . . . .?  The estate property was accepted by Congress which pledged the faith of the United States to a charitable trust for the benefit of the People of the United States.  The trust is administered by the Smithsonian Board of Regents, composed of the Chief Justice, the Vice President, three Members of the Senate, three Members of the House of Representatives, and nine citizens appointed by joint resolution of Congress.

2.	Background.  On April 30, 2002, the Smithsonian Office of Equal Employment and Minority Affairs (OEEMA) in conjunction with the Smithsonian Office of Contracting (OCon) conducted a Web/Multimedia Fair in which 68 web/multimedia vendors/producers participated.  At the Fair, Smithsonian staff were approached by multiple vendors requesting information about contracting opportunities for Smithsonian projects, whether paid or not.  In response to this unforeseen demand, Smithsonian program offices were invited to create a ?wish-list? of projects for which development and implementation were immediately desirable.  The result is attached separately to this notice for the review of any interested vendors (the ?Wish List?).

3.	Project Descriptions.  The Wish List is a synopsis, by Smithsonian museum/program office, of current needs for which there is no or insufficient money for development.  For all identified projects, we have estimated project size in accordance with the following scale: (A More Perfect Union <http://americanhistory.si.edu/perfectunion/experience/index.html> = small, Hirshhorn redesign <http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/> = medium, Explore the Universe <http://www.nasm.si.edu/galleries/gal111/universe/etu/index.html> = large), and, where relevant, the desired timeframe for completion. Initially created and posted on June 25, 2002, we intend to keep the Wish List up to date, adding newly identified needs and removing projects for which sufficient qualified and serious vendor response has been received as well as any for which a full commitment for programmatic support has lapsed.  Smithsonian reserves the right to rescind the Wish List in the event that insufficient response is generated on the identified projects.

4.	Minimum Requirements for Pre-Solicitation Response.  We can?t build it if you don?t come, therefore we invite interested and qualified vendors to identify those projects for which they would like to submit an offer.  To be responsive, submissions need merely identify your company, your URL, and any project(s) for which you desire the opportunity to develop on a pro bono basis. Please be sure to stipulate any restrictions which may apply to your level of interest (stating a hierarchy of preferred projects if, for example, you would care to submit a proposal for multiple ones but only enter into a contract to create a single one). This information will be collected and distributed to the originating program offices on a rolling basis, and for each project, as soon as a suitable bidlist has been established (e.g., at least 2-3 qualified candidates) we will contact the prospective offerors.  An indication of project interest by vendor(s) shall NEITHER obligate the vendor to submit a proposal to perform any work NOR obligate Smithsonian to invite proposals or issue contract(s) to have work performed.

5.	Responding to this Announcement:  Prospective offerors may ONLY submit information via e-mail to Bruce Falk, Office of Contracting at FalkB@si.edu.  Since it is presumed that relevant portfolios are viewable at the vendors? URL or obtainable upon request, no work samples are sought or required at this time. Offerors who submitted proposals in response to Smithsonian?s IDIQ RFP#F0236SOL0012 are permitted to make reference to any samples provided therein.  For these reasons, submissions greater than ONE SINGLE PAGE in length will be met with disdain.  (We are trying to make identification of desirable projects by interested firms as easy as possible; invited vendors will be given full opportunity to provide proposal(s) which address in detail specific project requirements.)

6.	Methodology for Competition.  Because these projects have little or no money attached to them, we will conduct the solicitation process in the following way.  First, the seriousness of vendor intent will be determined by follow-up contact prior to establishment of a bidlist, as bidlists will be kept small (preferring three offerors, but in no event more than five ? to the extent that more than five vendors express serious interest in a given project, we will make a determination as to which vendors to invite to submit a bid to ensure limited competition while minimizing vendor burden).  Second, identified, interested vendors will be provided with all criteria needed to draft a responsive proposal and invited to an initial discussion with the project team at least two weeks prior to the formal submission date.  Finally, Smithsonian shall evaluate the received proposals and intends to award a contract to the offeror whose proposal is evaluated to be responsive to project/solicitation requirements and the best from among all proposals received.  While specific criteria for any given project will be established and provided to preselected offerors prior to establishing a proposal due date, it is likely that credit recognition for any pro bono work awarded as a result of this announcement will be approximately equal to or greater than that currently offered by Smithsonian for its fully-budgeted development.

7.	Further Contact Info.  Please contact Bruce Falk immediately if you desire to receive a copy of the Wish List by e-mail, fax, or other format.  Vendors desiring clarification can submit questions either by phone (202) 275-1602, or in writing, by e-mail, or by fax at (202) 275-0624.  (We will make all reasonable effort to answer questions, but cannot guarantee response.)  Thank you for your attention to this pre-solicitation notice.  We look forward to hearing from you!

<ARCHDATE>05212004
<CONTACT>Mary Bretz Office Assistant 5038086359     OR952mb@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award of a contract with Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) to conduct field measurements, collect water quality samples, perform detailed data analysis, and provide results for incorporation into the Malheur River Total Maximum Daily Load process. The BLM is required to maintain water quality in public land streams that meet EPA-approved State of Oregon water quality standards, and improve water quality in streams that do not meet these standards. State-developed total maximum daily loads (TMDL's) and State-approved water quality management plans (WQMP's) are required for waterbodies in subbasins and watersheds with water quality-limited segments (as defined by Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act). ODEQ has scheduled the Malheur River Basin for TMDL/ WQMP completion by late 2004 or possibly early 2005.  However, BLM does not possess the water quality information for the Malheur River and associated tributaries needed for incorporation into the TMDL process.  The Malheur River Water Quality Project would acquire baseline nutrient data from the upper watershed to be used by ODEQ in a mathematical model of the basin for TMDL development. This would involve approximately 40 collections of field data; quality assurance to maintain standards of accuracy and precision; analysis of the data; and summary reports. The data are needed to validate the 303(d) listings, pinpoint water quality problems on public lands, and characterize baseline conditions for the Malheur River Basin to provide a basis for determining existing loading of phosphorus and bacteria, and to assist source analysis for these parameters at each site. The water quality analysis shall include conductivity, pH, alkalinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and water temperature. Analytical parameters will consist of ammonia, nitrate/nitrite, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorous, orthophosphorus, chemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, biological oxygen demand 5, and hardness, chlorophyll a, and coliform bacteria.  ODEQ has been selected to provide the work because of its extensive expertise in accurate data collection and analysis, and its statewide database for water quality.  ODEQ is the only contractor known to possess all of the following qualifications needed to meet BLM's requirements: (1) ability to conduct accurate and precise field measurements and analyses of water samples in remote areas; (2) ability to record water level data, field measurements, weather observations, including temperature and cloud cover; and physical conditions should they exist such as plankton abundance and conditions of riparian zones; (3) ability to collect sufficient water quality data to determine if the public lands in the upper watershed are indeed the primary source of phosphorus to the Malheur River; (4) ability to acquire baseline line nutrient data of sufficient quality and accuracy to be used by ODEQ in a mathematical model of the basin for TMDL development in 2004; (5) ability to provide quality assurance, chain-of-custody records, and ensure that data quality objectives ( Precision, Accuracy, Representativeness, Comparability, and Completeness) are met according to the requirements of the DEQ Laboratory Quality Assurance Manual (1999) (available at ODEQ, Laboratory Division, QA Section, Portland, OR); (6) ability to provide data of sufficient accuracy to be suitable for entry into the ODEQ LASAR database, and forward data to the BLM office in Vale, OR; and (7) prepare and submit a Summary Report of the results to BLM in Vale, OR. Firms which meet the above requirements should submit their qualifications in writing specifically addressing the seven criteria described above to the Contracting Officer. All responses received within fifteen days will be considered.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a multi-year, non-competitive modification to contract 223-01-2464 with AOAC International to provide FDA with accurate, reliable, practical, validated and published AOAC® Official MethodsSM for additional specified materials in bulk and/or solution form.   The aim of the project will be to obtain and disseminate scientifically reliable information concerning the validity and ruggedness of analytical methods that can be used to support FDA responder activities.  AOAC International will identify and in-house validate through the Performance Tested MethodsSM program a minimum of two candidate reference methods and five other rapid methods for specified materials in bulk and/or solution form.  Based on analytical performance, a single reference method and five other rapid methods will be selected for validation through an inter-laboratory collaborative study via the Official MethodSM program.  There is no other known source that offers or has an established record of acceptance without reservation in compliance action and in court.  Many AOAC International methods are specifically required in the enforcement of some state, provincial, municipal, and local laws and many federal food standards worldwide.  “Official Methods of Analysis” of AOAC International have been defined as “official” by regulations promulgated for enforcement of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 CFR 2.19).  The inter-laboratory peer-verified and/or collaborative analytical method testing processes are two of the foundations of AOAC International.  AOAC International is considered to be the only organization whose major focus is the validation of analytical chemistry methods.  To be adopted as an official method of AOAC International, every protocol is expected to meet the following criteria: accuracy, reliability, practicality, availability, validation by inter-laboratory studies, and acceptance for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific periodical.  In so doing, protocols become validated methods.  AOAC International counts more than 3,400 chemists (or other scientific professionals) among its members, making it the largest analytical chemistry protocol validation service in the world.  Other parties interested in and capable of performing this work shall submit their capability statement on or before June 6, 2003.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) continues to have a need for storage, monitoring and distributing blood, urine, tissue and other samples collected currently by 14 NICHD programs.  We are looking for capability statements from Small Businesses to determine if there is adequate number of potential Offerors to compete this requirement as a Small Business Set-Aside.  The NAICS code is 54171.  The following criteria define NICHD's requirement for the repository.  a) There are approximately 2.5 million vials of biological specimens that have been collected under various research protocols.  Storing them all will require space for 1,250,000 vials stored at -20 degrees C; 900,000 at -70 degrees C; 170,000 stored in liquid nitrogen (LN).  Currently, the government owns 24 freezers for -70 degree storage and 6 liquid nitrogen units.  Any potential Offeror would be expected to supply the additional freezer space as additional collections are added.  Over the next five years, it is estimated that the collections will need space for up to 1,400,000 vials stored at -20 degrees C; 1,750,000 vials at -70 degrees C; 215,000 in LN; total approximately 3,375,000 specimens.  All storage must be in the same or adjoining buildings not more than two minutes' walking time apart in order to ensure that any sample during transfer to another freezer is exposed for a minimal amount of time at room temperature.  Building(s) must be equipped with adequate and appropriate monitoring facilities that include back-up electrical power source(s) and alarm systems.  b) The specimens must be catalogued into a computerized inventory system that must be able to locate every sample.  The inventory system must be computer based, currently in use, demonstrated to be able to manage a repository of this size, and able to locate any specimen without the assistance of the NICHD beyond the provision of a subject ID number and date the specimen was drawn.  Since the information collected on the samples from each of the 14 programs differs, the inventory system must be able to accommodate from 3 to 25 items per specimen, including tracking data for in/out status, number of times thawed, etc.  c) Since some of the samples will require pick-up from the NIH campus, it is required that the Offeror's facility be located so that the total time between pick-up and delivery to the facility shall not exceed two (2) hours driving time of the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  d) Respondents must demonstrate capability of retrieving specimens from inventory, aliquot them into a new container, and ship them to designated locations upon request.  e) Respondents must demonstrate the capability to return to inventory all unused aliquots.  And f) Respondents must demonstrate the capability to inventory and receive new specimen into the repository.  Only sources who are Small Businesses or 8(a) need respond to this announcement.  On the face page of your response, indicate whether you are a Small Business or an 8(a).  Please submit 4 hard copies of your capability statement, which should not exceed 10 pages in length, by June 9, 2003 to: Mrs. Lynn Salo, Contract Specialist, CMB, NICHD, NIH, 6100 Executive Building, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (or overnight courier: 6100 Executive Blvd., Rockville, Maryland 20852).

<SUBJECT>A -- Fiber Optic Sensors Technology
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS COLLABORATIVE R & D PARTNERS TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE FIBER OPTIC SENSORS TECHNOLOGY

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), seeks collaborative research and development partner(s) to further develop and commercialize its portfolio of fiber optic sensors (micromachined fiber optic accelerometer; fiber optic gap gauge; and silicon method for making fiber optic sensors). 

Micromachined Fiber Optic Accelerometer

This sensor is of the broadest utility where acceleration measurements in the milli-g to kilo-g range are desired in the frequency range of DC to about a hundred kHz. Motions in mechanical structures such as physics experiments, explosive environments, industrial machinery, bridges, automobiles, and planes can be determined. The results may be useful for determining forces, failures and failure prediction, and navigation. It is particularly well suited to minimally invasive probes; explosive, hazardous or extreme environments since no wires are employed and the package is extremely robust; sensor applications with high EMI; and remote readout instruments without loss of fidelity.

This miniature, passive, remote-readout, silicon chip based accelerometer sensor combines a micromachined proof mass and support beam springs system where a vertically milled face of the proof mass forms one mirror of a Fabry-Perot optical cavity. The cleaved end of the readout fiber forms the other mirror. This device has the acceleration axis and the fiber axis in the plane of the wafer; it also has smaller dimensions perpendicular to this axis enabling practical emplacement. 
 
Fiber Optic Gap Gauge

This device can be used for any gap gauge application requiring small size, no electrical connections, high sensitivity, absolute readout, long-term stability over a wide temperature range, extremely long lead length using optical fiber and intrinsic safety for hazardous and extreme environments. Possible commercial industry uses include manufacturing systems, aerospace vehicles, structure monitoring systems, and medical devices.

This device is a miniature fiber optic readout gauge for measuring the gap between two flat surfaces. The gauge is immune to electromagnetic interference, intrinsically safe for high explosive applications and can be remotely interrogated over a kilometer distance without a change in resolution or calibration. The gauge has an absolute range from zero to one millimeter.


Silicon Fiber Optic Sensor

There are a variety of industrial applications for this invention that include miniature temperature, strain, pressure, optical index and other sensors. This invention is a novel process and device structure that creates low-cost Fabry-Perot silicon optical sensors.  
This invention uses microfabrication techniques to fabricate sensors for physical parameters such as temperature, strain, and pressure. 

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in developing and commercializing LLNL's fiber optic sensors should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO000023-03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's fiber optic sensors technology for a variety of commercial applications.
