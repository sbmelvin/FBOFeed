(CAST) and Bed Rock, Inc. d/b/a Tri-State Motor Transit Company (TSMT) on a sole source bridge basis to provide uninterrupted support while the follow-on procurement numbered DE-RP30-06EW20001 is competed and awards are made. The Government intends to extend the current contract on a monthly option period basis with phase in coverage included which is expected to last no longer then the end of Fiscal Year 2007. This extension is being made noncompetitively based on the exclusion found at Federal Acquisition Regulation, FAR 6.302 1 a, which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within the required time-frame. To DOEâs knowledge and belief, only CAST and TSMT have the requisite specialized equipment and highly specialized technical experience and training to ensure that the CBFOâs requirements are met within the required delivery schedules. The strict contract requirements for drivers making transuranic (TRU) waste shipments to WIPP that are included in an agreement between the Secretary of Energy and the Southern States Energy Board (SSEB) and the Western Governorsâ Association (WGA) result in it taking a long period of time for a contractor to hire drivers and complete an extensive training program (requiring 90 to 120 days) before a contractor can use new drivers to make WIPP shipments. In addition, the contractsâ tractor specifications are much more stringent than the industry standard requiring tractors being utilized under the contracts to be specially ordered thereby requiring at least several months for a contractor to procure or lease tractors that may be used to make WIPP shipments. Due to the long period of time required for a new contractor to transition and initiate WIPP TRU waste shipments these services are available only from the existing contractors. No other firms have the requisite equipment, training, experience and capability to assume the critical, highly specialized transportation support without causing an interruption in services. The present contracts with CAST and TSMT end on April 27, 2007; THERE ARE NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE FOR THE EXTENSION OF THESE TWO CONTRACTS. Interested, responsible sources may submit information regarding their capability to perform this requirement, which shall be considered by the Department. Information received will be considered for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive acquisition. CAST and TSMT currently provide approximately 30 TRU waste shipments per week to WIPP from various DOE defense TRU waste generator sites including Hanford Reservation Richland, WA, Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Idaho Falls, ID, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Los Alamos, NM, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Oak Ridge, TN, Office of River Protection (ORP) Richland, WA, Savannah River Site (SRS) and other sites. The effort includes the transport of contact-handled (CH) and remote-handled (RH) transuranic (TRU) waste in Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) certified Type B shipping packages. The contract effort requires providing facilities, personnel, and equipment to provide a local terminal and transportation and maintenance services. Contractor-provided equipment will include tractors and necessary support equipment. The Contractor shall provide transportation services necessary to support WIPP, including: transportation of mixed and non-mixed CH- and RH-TRU waste, asbestos, and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated TRU waste from generator sites to WIPP; transportation of CH- and RH-TRU waste between generator sites; transportation of training units or empty shipping containers to training/exercises, public awareness events; and, other equipment as designated by CBFO and maintenance. The Statement of Work for the requirement is provided on the Departmentâs Industry Interactive Procurement System. Any responding party must provide a capability statement demonstrating its capability, as discussed above, which must include the following, as these items are necessary to demonstrate that the responding party is capable of performing the contemplated work without interruption: (1) a statement that proposed personnel (terminal manager, drivers, mechanics, safety, and support personnel) are currently employed by the responding party and will be available to perform the contemplated work; or a letter of commitment from personnel that the responding party intends to use to perform the contemplated work who are not currently employed by the responding party, demonstrating that they will be available to perform the contemplated work; (2) a chart or other synopsis of how the Contractâs training requirements have been or will be met prior to the start of performance; (3) a chart or other synopsis demonstrating that proposed personnel currently meet other minimum contract requirements; (4) a certification that the responding party possesses a local terminal or lease agreement continent upon the award suitable for dispatching and tractor and trailer maintenance; (5) documentation demonstrating the Offeror has a satisfactory U.S. Department of Transportation Motor Carrier rating; and (6) a discussion of the ability of the Offeror to successfully pass a Motor Carrier Evaluation Program (MCEP) Audit of all facets of a carrierâs business operations including an extensive on site physical review of records and equipment. Responses to this synopsis must be received via the Departmentâs Industry Interactive Procurement System by 9:00 a.m. (MDT) on February 7, 2007 to be considered. The web address is http://e-center.doe.gov, and assistance in submitting a capability statement through the system can be obtained by calling the help desk at 1-800-683-0751 between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. eastern time, Monday through Friday.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Anne Sassaman, Durham, NC 27711 pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This purchase is for consultant services as per the following statement of work which outlines services to be provided by Dr. Anne Sassaman in support of the NIH Extramural Title 42 Committee established to implement policies for extramural staff.    Statement of Work  Provide expert consultant services in support of the NIH Extramural Title 42 Committee (ETFC), a new NIH-wide group established to implement policies for extramural/policy staff on title 42 appointments.  This work will consist of preparing background material for regular meetings of the committee regarding the establishment of new T42 positions; appointment of new recruits to a T42 position or transfer of existing staff from T5 appointments to T42; analysis of information provided by NIH Institutes/centers in relation to established criteria; and strategy recommendations for consideration by the NIH committee.Period of performance:  Period of three (3) years from date of award 
Labor Hours NTE:  ~160 hours per year  
Travel:  Actual reimbursement to be based on the current government per diem rates for an estimated 2 trips to Bethesda for 3 years, one day each.   
  		
Deliverables:  
 	By no later than December 31, 2007, provide an annual summary of service to the ETFC established to implement policies for extramural/policy staff on title 42 appointments, including copies of background material prepared for regular meetings of the committee regarding the establishment of new T42 positions; appointments of new T42 recruits or transfer of existing staff from T5 appointments to T42; and analyses of NIEHS-provided information in relation to established criteria and recommendations provided to the NIH committee.
Sole Source Justification:  The objective of this procurement is to obtain the services of a consultant to guide, assist, and facilitate OER/OD NIH staff for a three year ?on call? period to complete the Statement of Work attached hereto.   The sole source proposed for this work is Dr. Anne Sassaman, and this sole source justification results from the fact that Dr. Sassaman?s qualifications for this particular task are unique, as follows:  To the best of the Agency?s knowledge, no other contractor has the level of experience and skills and historical knowledge of current and past NIH extramural activities as required for optimal performance of the T42 analyses and support to the NIH for the following reasons.  The projects described in the statement of work require an extensive hands-on working knowledge of responsibilities of senior extramural scientific positions and the history and intent of using the Title 42 mechanism for certain positions.  Of paramount importance is a historical knowledge of the variety of positions that could possibly be included under Title 42, the various organizational structures used by the Institutes and Centers (ICs) to perform functions included as ?extramural? for the purposes of this activity, and the factors considered by NIH and DHHS as critical for determining the appropriate use of the Title 42 appointment for non-intramural scientists at the NIH.  
Thus, in order to perform the described tasks, any other contractor would need to first develop an extensive historical background and current working knowledge of a broad range of issues related to Title 42 versus Title 5 appointment mechanisms as they relate to specific positions within the NIH extramural staff.   For example, an extensive understanding of the missions and complexities of NIH ICs and the different organizational structures that would go into decisions related to the different categories for NIH Extramural Title 42 designation as well as the proposed salaries or salary ranges is critical for the performance of these duties. The contractor must be able to analyze proposed appointments and to prepare a justification for consideration of the ETFC in relation to established criteria as well as decisions on previous candidates for consistency and fairness.  Without that knowledge, the contractor would have to rely upon NIH staff to assume the extensive burden of explaining goals and historical issues, to bring the contractor up to speed in advance of beginning the activities under this contract. In addition, these projects must be started quickly in accordance with NIH timeframes, to ensure that related proposed appointments and conversions are handled efficiently and without undue delay, as this could affect recruitment of senior-level scientific staff into extramural positions.  Only a contractor with significant and current hands-on experience with NIH could conduct this work in the timeframe available to the Agency for its completion.  
Unique Qualifications of Dr. Anne Sassaman:
The proposed contractor, Dr. Anne Sassaman, has the unique qualifications necessary to perform the range of tasks involved in this contract without the need to spend an inordinate amount of time identifying and understanding the Agency?s positions and expectations in these matters.  First and foremost, Dr. Sassaman has thirty-two (32) years of Federal service, over 30 of which are at the NIH.   For the most recent twenty (20) years, she served NIEHS, first as a member of the Senior Executive Service and then as a Title 42 scientist, as the Director of the NIEHS Division of Extramural Research and Training.  Over this period she represented the NIEHS on the NIH Extramural Policy Management Committee where she worked with other extramural directors on NIH-wide program and policy issues.  She served on a number of working groups that gave her extensive knowledge of structure and responsibilities of scientific positions in other ICs and was involved in numerous presentations and discussions as Title 42 was inaugurated for extramural positions.  Through these discussions she has unique and thorough knowledge of the various issues that resulted in a census of all current extramural Title 42 employees, development of a structure for various levels of seniority/responsibility/pay scales, and criteria for review of positions according to this new framework.  The ETFC is responsible for overseeing this process, and Dr. Sassaman is intimately familiar with the work and responsibilities of this committee.  Her knowledge is current and extensive and provides her with unique qualifications for this task.  Her broad range of very specialized experience is a necessity in completing the tasks described in the Statement of Work.  This hands-on NIEHS and NIH leadership experience make her uniquely qualified to provide expert counsel and support for the NIH-wide project described above.  
Dr. Anne Sassaman is also the only consultant known to the Institute who also has the specific management skills necessary for this project in the timeframe required. Her expert skills, coupled with her extended past and present knowledge of NIH and especially issues related to Title 42 appointments will ensure mission continuity and optimal outcomes for the OER/OD NIH project in accordance with timeframes that cannot be extended.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability.  Respond to this requirement by submitting written capabilities/specifications to the Contracting Specialist at the address stated above.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 8 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If no affirmative responses are received within 8 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Dr. Ann Sassaman.  The NAICS Code/Size is 541690/$6.5M.  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition threshold of $100,000.  There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.*****

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source purchase order to Quality Techniques Inc. to provide support services for the establishment of an ISO 9001 compliant Quality Management System (QMS) for the Administrator for Regions and Centers (ARC) Logistics Service Centers within the Federal Aviation Administration's Central, Eastern, and Western Logistics Service Areas, and to prepare for ISO 9001 certification. Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures. This specific requirement is to support the expansion of ARC's QMS within all three of its logistics services centers, Western, Central and Eastern.  The ARC Logistics Service Centers' need is to standardize and align their QMS processes under a single QMS model for reasons of efficiency, standardization and improved quality of goods and services, and recognizes the process improvements achieved within the Southwest region and would like to multiply these gains by bringing all regions and service centers under a single QMS as they prepare for an ARC wide ISO 9001 certification by 2010.   Quality Techniques recently worked with the Southwest region of the Central Service Center to develop their QMS, which led to a successful ISO 9001 certification audit by an independent ISO Registrar.   Quality Techniques has a solid understanding and in-depth knowledge of ARC's logistics business and can use this experience to further standardize and improve processes across the remaining regions and service centers.    A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement because of the time constraints associated with the completion of this effort.  If your firm believes it can fulfill the requirement, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Debby Getz, Contracting Officer by 9:00 A.M. CST, 18 Jan 2007.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to Vehicle Control Technologies (VCT) to analyze the AN/AQS-20A hydrodynamic data in two configurations ((1) VSS and (2) EOID) from the MH-60S AN/AQS-20A WSIT CT and use it as an input data to correlate existing models and improve model validity.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  Vehicle Control Technologies (VCT) has performed all of the mathematic modeling for the AN/AQS-20/A tow body.  VCT is the company that created and owns the localizer algorithm.  To accurately correlate and validate the AN/AQS-20A model is critical to the operation of the AN/AQS-20A.  Use of another company to modify the algorithm may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable error into the AN/AQS-20A system.  Failure to have an accurate model could result in significant damage to the AN/AQS-20A tow body and maybe even loss of U. S. Navy vessels.  Ther!  efore it is imperative that this effort is awarded to VCT immediately.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Develop Automated Profiling/Screening Tool To Identify Administrative Law Judge Disability Decisions That Are Likely To Be Appealed To Fed District Court AND Remanded/Reversed By The Court
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFP-07-1011
<CONTACT>Elizabeth Faykus, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-4736, Fax 410-965-9560, Email elizabeth.faykus@ssa.gov - Elliott Pimentel, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-594-2034, Fax 410-965-9560, Email elliott.pimentel@ssa.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to advise interested parties that the Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to release a Requests for Proposals (RFP) for the services of a contractor to develop an automated, Section 508 compliant, profiling/screening tool (software) for identifying Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) disability decisions to FedBizOpps and will upload the solicitation document when issued. Period of performance is one 12 month period with two 12 months option periods.  An Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type of contract to allow firm fixed price, labor hour, and time and materials task orders is anticipated.  This contract will be solicited using FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for the services of a contractor to develop an automated, Section 508 compliant*, profiling/screening tool (software) for identifying Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) disability decisions that are likely to be appealed to federal district court and remanded or reversed by the court.     The contractor may also recommend the purchase and/or modification of an existing Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) software package for the profiling/screening tool if an existing product can be identified.

On March 31, 2006, SSA published the final rules establishing a new disability determination and administrative appeals process effective August 1, 2006.     Under the new rules SSA is gradually phasing out the Appeals Council?s review of disability claims and replacing it with a review by a Decision Review Board (DRB).     The DRB will focus on identifying decision making errors as well as policies and procedures that will improve decision-making at all levels of the disability determination process. 

SSA intends to select ALJ decisions for review by the DRB in several different ways, including the use of computer based predictive screening tools.     It is envisioned that a sophisticated computer based profiling/screening tool could be developed to help identify unfavorable ALJ decisions that contain characteristics associated with federal district court appeals and remands or reversals.     The profiling model will be developed using data recorded at the time of the initial level determination, ALJ decision, Appeals Council review, and the court action.     This information includes the applicant?s age, education years, primary impairment, reason for the court remand, etc.     The methods for selecting cases for DRB review are expected to evolve over time as more data are available and SSA gains more experience and knowledge in the use of computer-based tools.     Any software will make use of current SSA databases and systems architecture already available, if applicable.

All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  

*Note:     Any products and/or services the Government intends to acquire must allow the Government to support its obligations under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.     See http://www.ssa.gov/oag/acq/oagacq_508.htm for more information.

Detailed specifications will be provided in the solicitation document.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Due to the ongoing delays being encountered at the Pentagon regarding the current CFT source selection, it has become necessary to contemplate extending the current contracts to allow for continued customer support.  Per FAR Clause 52.217-8, the Government has the ability to extend the current contracts up to a total of 6 months past the end of the current ordering period.  This should be considered as "official" notice that the Government does intend to invoke this right.  
 
Formal modifications will be issued to each current contractor prior to 30 Sep 07, but an exact date for issuance is unknown at this time.  Upon issuance of these contract modifications, the revised period of performance will be indicated, but shall not be extended beyond 31 Mar 2008.  Under NO circumstances will any new orders be issued after that date.
 
The current contracts do allow for the continued performance of existing orders for a period of up to 120 days beyond the expiration of the ordering period, provided any work cannot be completed by that date.  This means the latest possible date work can be performed is 31 Jul 2008 at a maximum.  If any work cannot be completed within the 120 days, an extension MAY be processed provided the Government and Contractor can agree to a price and completion date and the result is processed bilaterally.  This action will be considered the last resort to finishing a task and will only be utilized on a case by case basis when the requirement justifies it.  This will not be abused in a manner to attempt to circumvent use of the new contracts, once awarded.
  
The source selection team would like to thank everyone for their continued patience and cooperation during this process.  Please disseminate this information within your organizations as necessary.
 
If anyone has any questions regarding this action, please feel free to contact Brandi Priddy at 405-739-4400 or Jeff Frederick at 405-739-4297 at any time.

In addition, the new contract will include award term incentive provisions that will allow for extension of the performance period another three years through 30 Sep 2016.  Large businesses considering participating in this acquisition as the prime contractor should be prepared to meet a small business subcontract goal of at least 20%. The C26B/RC-26B is a militarized version of the FAA-type certificated Fairchild SA227-DC aircraft. The aircraft is powered by twin Honeywell TPE331-12UA-701G turboprop engines. The current fleet consists of 22 aircraft, 11 Air National Guard (ANG), and 11 Army National Guard (ARNG). The aircraft are currently based at 19 CONUS and 1 OCONUS locations (see below. The ARNG (C-26B) mission is to provide time-sensitive movement of personnel and cargo, as well as limited medical evacuation. The ANG (RC-26B) aircraft have been modified as Information, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) support aircraft carrying specialized electronic equipment to provide aerial surveillance and reconnaissance for law enforcement and other Government agencies. The aircraft Main Operating Base (MOB) locations for the ANG are: Fresno ANGB, CA; Clarksburg, WV; Jacksonville, FL; Kirtland AFB, NM; Meridian MS; Houston, TX; Syracuse, NY; Fairchild AFB, WA; Tucson, AZ; Madison, WI; and Montgomery, AL.

<DESC>This is not a notice of solicitation issuance. The Naval Air Systems Command PMA-207C3, Patuxent River, MD is notifying interested parties to the aircraft site survey for C/KC-130T that as of today January 18, 2007 NAVAIR will no longer be accepting requests to attend the conference due to reaching the maximum number of attendance. THE AIRCRAFT SITE SURVEY IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED OR FOR ANY TRAVEL RELATED EXPENSES. 



THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  The Naval Air Systems Command, PMA-207C3, Patuxent River, MD intends to hold an aircraft site survey.     
The goal of the survey will be to provide aircraft access for industry in preparation for the potential release of an RFP for the C/KC-130T Avionics Modernization Program (AMP).  The Navy is looking to upgrade the avionics subsystems for the USMC KC-130T and Navy C-130T aircraft.  The desired modernization solution will be accomplished by replacing aging, unreliable equipment and adding additional equipment necessary to meet Communication, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  The end solution will reduce parts obsolescence and maintenance work and reduce aircrew size while providing increased situational awareness to the aircrew.  The solution will also provide full internal and external night vision compatible lighting in an integrated open system architecture to reduce the impact of future upgrades.  The modernization solution should reuse appropriate existing aircraft systems as well as integrate the existing defensive systems.  The Navy desires to leverage off existing modernization programs, solutions and proven technology.

Each prime contractor team will have a 2 hour block to survey the aircraft and within this 2 hour block they will receive an in-brief, process through maintenance control at the squadron, and then out to the aircraft to complete their survey. Strict time will be kept with a countdown imposed to ensure the contractors are off the aircraft within their allotted time. Each team taken to the aircraft will have their possessions inventoried (i.e. pens, pencils, clip boards, note pads, cameras, measuring equipment, and tools). A flight engineer will be available at the aircraft to assist as required and answer questions concerning the current configuation not the potential RFP release.  The contractors will be allowed to take measurements, still pictures, and video. 

There will be power on the aircraft throughout the event. The following areas will be made accessible: 1) The under deck rack, 2) Circuit breaker panels will be opened,
3) Panels aft of the 245 bulkhead will be opened, 4) Some external panels may be opened weather permitting, 5) Stands and or man lifts will be available if required to look at external features.

This aircraft survey is limited to prime contractors, with each company limited to 10 attendees.  The contractors are encouraged to include their subcontractors as part of their attendees.

The survey is scheduled to be held on 6, 7, and 8 February 2007 aboard the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD 20670.  Parties interested in attending the conference are encouraged to contact Ms. Jackie Mercer via e-mail Jackie.mercer@navy.mil and  Ms. Mary Ann Foran via e-mail Maryann.foran@navy.mil. 

All interested parties, please provide the following information: Organization name and address, primary POC, phone/fax and e-mail of the primary POC, and the number of personnel attending.  

THE AIRCRAFT SITE SURVEY IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED OR FOR ANY TRAVEL RELATED EXPENSES.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLICATATIONON/REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THIS IS 100% HUBZONE SET-ASIDE. The Solicitation Number for this announcement is N62467-06-R-0104.  THIS IS A 100% PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS CONSTRUCTION of Munitions Facilities at Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, South Carolina.  The 2002 NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the small business size standard is $31 Million.  The Federal Supply Code is Y171, Construction of Facilities/Office Buildings.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 20 percent of the contract work with its own employees. The proposed solicitation will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  

The Munitions Facilities construction project consists of four separate buildings.  The proposed sites for the new buildings are located in the existing Munitions Facilities Compound on the northeastern portion of the base.  The site area is defined by an existing secured perimeter chain-link fence and includes munitions and equipment storage areas.   

The Munitions Administration/Mobility Storage Building combines administrative and storage functions.  The Munitions Administration/Mobility Storage Building consists of approximately 6960 SF of administrative space and 8042 SF of high bay storage for a total of 15,002 SF gross building area.  The new facility will be constructed utilizing a pre-engineered building structure with a 3:12 pitch metal roof and metal siding.  A 4 ft height, split-face CMU wainscot will be provided around the administration portion of the new facility.  The remainder of the exterior wall will consist of pre-engineered metal panels.  Interior partitions in the administration area will be metal studs with gypsum board.  Floors will be carpet in the offices and VCT in the corridors and break rooms.  Restrooms and locker rooms will have ceramic tile floors.  The storage bays consist of twelve bays (55 ft x 12 ft) for trailer storage and space for training functions.  Demolition of Buildings 1800, 1801, and 1803 will be required before construction is started on the new building.  Demolition of Buildings 1805 and 1807 will be deferred until construction is complete on the new building in order to phase the occupancy of the administration areas.  The total demolition area is 5000 SF 

The Four-Bay Maintenance Facility contains approximately 3784 SF of administrative space and 5166 SF of munitions maintenance area consisting of four drive-through bays for a total of approximately 8950 SF.  Three of the walls separating the bays will be Substantial Dividing Walls or Blast Walls, which are required for prevention of propagation of burning reactions.  The new facility will be constructed utilizing a pre-engineered building structure with a 3:12 pitch metal roof and metal siding.    Interior partitions in the administration area will be metal studs with gypsum board.  Floors will be carpet in the offices and VCT in the corridors and break rooms.  Restrooms and locker rooms will have ceramic tile floors.  Specialized equipment in the maintenance bays includes low and high-pressure air and 400hz power for support of portable air ground equipment.  A catenary lightning protection will be provided for the Four-Bay Maintenance Facility.

The third and fourth buildings are each 2080 square foot munitions storage igloos.  The storage igloos will have reinforced concrete bearing walls with reinforced concrete roof, floor and foundation systems.  The structures will be earth covered and will feature blast-resistant steel doors, explosion-proof lighting, exterior security lighting, an intrusion detection system, and a catenary lightning protection system.

The work for each new building includes communication and fire protection systems, all supporting utilities, and site work consisting of parking aprons, access drives, and landscaping.  The estimated cost of this acquisition is between $6,000,000 and $6,750,000.

<DESC>See FedBidOpps Pre-Solicitation posting for solicitation number SSA-RFP-07-1011.   

------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this notice is to advise interested parties that the Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to release a Requests for Proposals (RFP) for the services of a contractor to develop an automated, Section 508 compliant, profiling/screening tool (software) for identifying Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) disability decisions to FedBizOpps and will upload the solicitation document when issued.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for the services of a contractor to develop an automated, Section 508 compliant*, profiling/screening tool (software) for identifying Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) disability decisions that are likely to be appealed to federal district court and remanded or reversed by the court.  The contractor may also recommend the purchase and/or modification of an existing Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software package for the profiling/screening tool if an existing product can be identified.

On March 31, 2006, SSA published the final rules establishing a new disability determination and administrative appeals process effective August 1, 2006.  Under the new rules SSA is gradually phasing out the Appeals Council?s review of disability claims and replacing it with a review by a Decision Review Board (DRB).  The DRB will focus on identifying decision-making errors as well as policies and procedures that will improve decision-making at all levels of the disability determination process. 

SSA intends to select ALJ decisions for review by the DRB in several different ways, including the use of computer-based predictive screening tools.  It is envisioned that a sophisticated computer-based profiling/screening tool could be developed to help identify unfavorable ALJ decisions that contain characteristics associated with federal district court appeals and remands or reversals.  The profiling model will be developed using data recorded at the time of the initial level determination, ALJ decision, Appeals Council review, and the court action.  This information includes the applicant?s age, education years, primary impairment, reason for the court remand, etc.  The methods for selecting cases for DRB review are expected to evolve over time as more data are available and SSA gains more experience and knowledge in the use of computer-based tools.  Any software will make use of current SSA databases and systems architecture already available, if applicable.

*Note:  Any products and/or services the Government intends to acquire must allow the Government to support its obligations under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  See http://www.ssa.gov/oag/acq/oagacq_508.htm for more information.

Detailed specifications will be provided in the solicitation document.

MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY, A SOLICITATION WILL NOT FOLLOW THIS REQUEST

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), is seeking interest from 8(a) firms in the following districts:  Atlanta, Georgia and Jacksonville, Florida.  The DHS-FLETC is in process of determining the viability of issuance of Basic Ordering Agreement's, (BOA's) encompassing each district. The estimated time of performance will be a base year period of three (3) years, with two (2) one-year option periods.  BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Offices.  The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the DHS-FLETC and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. On an annual basis, the DHS-FLETC and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  When the DHS-FLETC has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only, to the contractors for submission of a proposal. If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA Districts noted in this synopsis.

The Contracting Officer, will reserve the right to award subsequent task orders using one of the following methods:  Tradeoff (aka Best Value); Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA); or Price only.  When awarding using Tradeoff or LPTA, Contracting Officer may consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to proceed with task order procurement on a sole source basis, or to compete an action among select BOA holders, whichever is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond and Performance and Payment Bond for each Task Order over $100,000.00. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by DHS-FLETC to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that DHS-FLETC solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only.   DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The anticipated work will involve a variety of trades, including, but not limited to, carpentry, road repair, roofing, excavation, interior and exterior electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, painting, demolition, concrete masonry, welding and HVAC.

GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick (Glynco), Georgia.   The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. If a firm is graduating from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will terminate. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued.  Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party.  Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. The contractor may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Government approval as well as a price proposal.   SOLICITATIONS: Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror.

MODIFICATION 1 -  RFI must be submitted to FSA by 1:00 p.m. CST on January 23, 2007. Request for Information - The United Stated Department of Agricultures (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) seeks information related to its investigation of ways to consolidate and centralize its distributed AS/400 systems currently hosted in 2384 Service Centers.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). FSA intends to assess the capabilities and, if appropriate, issue an RFP at a later date.  Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such.  The Government will not pay for, nor reimburse, any expenses incurred in responding to this RFI.  Background - Current Environment:  FSAs current distributed environment includes 2384 State and County Service Centers, each equipped with an AS/400 Model 170 system.  Local users access their offices AS/400 via PC workstations running 5250 terminal emulation.  Output is printed on a combination of twinax-attached and network-attached printers.  An average office has about four users, making a total user community of about 10,000.  The primary use of these systems is to run S/36 applications developed and maintained by FSA from 1984 to the present.  These applications run in the S/36 Virtual Machine environment (not to be confused with the S36 Environment, or S36E).  The S/36 Virtual Machine environment provides binary compatibility for S/36 applications and data. IBM dropped support for the S/36 Virtual Machine after release V4R4 of the OS/400 operating system.  Our reliance on the S/36 Virtual Machine forces us to remain on an unsupported version of the OS/400 operating system.  The S/36 application portfolio consists of COBOL, RPG, and Assembler programs and subroutines; Screen and Menu members; OCL.  These make use of unique S/36 capabilities and extensions such as the Local Data Area, and OCL substitution expressions.  System facilities such as IDDU and Query/36 are also used.  The data is stored in Indexed (including Alternative Indices), Sequential, and Direct files.  Some files have multiple record types; and some numeric-defined fields may contain non-numeric data.   Each AS/400-S/36 environment hosts one to six counties.  The S/36 namespace does not include a hierarchical file system.  A naming convention is used to allow each of hosted counties to use the same file names.  The first counties filenames begin with A., the second with B. and so on.  This convention works fine for supporting a small number of counties on a single machine, but cannot be extended to support large-scale consolidation.  The applications were developed under the assumption that they would be running in a small, local namespace.  In 2000, FSA started deploying AS/400 systems and re-hosted the applications and data from S/36 systems.  Once on the AS/400 platform, FSA started using DB2, TCPIP, Java, Websphere, and MQ Series, as well as the S/36 emulation.  MQ Software products Data Flow Studio (DFS) and QPasa are also used for file transmissions and MQ Series administration.  The complete current environment consists of AS/400s running S/36 emulation, plus some AS/400-side code (CL, COBOL), DB2 databases, TCPIP communications, Java, Websphere, and MQ Series, DFS, and QPasa.  In addition to the legacy applications, FSA has developed centralized web-based applications.  Once a full suite of Web-based applications is available, these will replace the legacy applications and the distributed environment.  Some of the existing web-based applications must get data from, or replicate data to the legacy applications.  This is done through a combination of AS/400 CL programs, Java programs, Websphere applications, MQ Series, DFS, QPasa, and additions to legacy applications.  Planned Environment:  The data stored on the 2,384 AS/400 systems includes sensitive personal and financial data.  Recent audits have identified a lack of physical security at the Service Centers, which house these systems, as a risk.  The Service Centers are generally leased office spaces located across the country.  Improving the physical security in all of these offices is an expensive process and is not likely to be accomplished quickly.  The building changes would have to be negotiated into the individual leases, and may not be possible until the current leases expire.  Due to the cost and timeframe of improving physical security, FSA is exploring the alternative of re-hosting the legacy applications in a small number of secure, central sites.  FSA is researching several variations of the centralized hosting approach, but they all share many characteristics.  The number of central sites being considered is in the range of 1 to 6.  For all centralized approaches, Service Center users will remotely access the centralized servers from their local workstations, via terminal emulation software or a web client.  Print output will be directed back to network printers in the appropriate Service Center.  The centralized systems will interact with other hosts, including mainframe and web farm.  The centralized approaches under consideration are:  1.  FSA would remove the existing AS/400 systems from the Service Centers and relocate all of the existing hardware to a small number (1-6) of centralized hosting facilities.  For six centers, this is about 400 AS/400 systems per center.  2.  FSA would re-host the legacy applications and data on a larger computing platform, which provides binary-level emulation of the current environment AS/400, S/36, MQ Series, Websphere, etc.  Assuming that one larger system can host the workload from many legacy AS/400s, and that users and data can be correctly routed and segregated, re-hosting on larger systems would mean fewer systems for the hosting facilities to operate.  This consolidation may include providing a virtual partition for each existing system.  3.  FSA would re-compile application software in order to migrate to another hardware platform, which could be scaled so that a single system would do the work of many legacy AS/400 systems.  This is similar to approach #2, except with re-compilation and migration work.  4.  FSA wishes to solicit any other relevant available options that could remove the physical security vulnerability while ensuring successful program delivery.  Desirable characteristics include:  Ability to run all existing applications and Query 36 without modification, Support combined AS/400 S/36 environment (DDM, ILAN, STRM36PRC, RUN400, etc.), Support AS/400 software, including Websphere 3.5, MQ Series, DFS, QPasa, Ability to implement without recompiling code  (Recompiling will add difficulty and complexity), Minimal changes for the FSA software developers.  FSA will continue to develop in the S/36 environment, Ability to address scaling and namespace issues, Ability to connect each remote user to the correct partition/namespace/data, Correct printing of reports, User experience and performance similar to current environment, Minimal downtime, at least comparable to current environment, Ad hoc report capability; Query 36 is preferred.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to delete the original REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - Next Generation Wireless Networking with the following revised version:

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - Alternative Paradigms in Wireless Networking

DESCRIPTION

The DoD has traditionally used a "hub-and-spoke" wireless communication paradigm to support tactical edge operations. This architectural paradigm, also known as a "star" topology, provides routing simplicity and centralized data processing for efficient data aggregation and network control. The infrastructure-laden topology, however, suffers from critical drawbacks including scalability and mobility limitations. 

In recent years, the DoD and commercial industry have invested significant funding into the research and development of a revolutionary, paradigm-shifting approach called Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET) because of its potential performance advantages for tactical edge communications. MANET technology does not require the inflexible base stations and towers typically used as hubs in the traditional paradigm. The MANET paradigm allows for an open peer-to-peer architecture that supports dynamic network topologies that both self-organize and self-heal for significant increases in flexibility and fault tolerance, while drastically reducing cost. Initial MANET implementations are currently making their way into theatre for significantly enhanced tactical capability. The DoD is currently focusing much of its wireless networking research funding on advances in MANET technology to improve network reliability, security, and performance in high tempo mobile environments. 

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Strategic Technology Office (DARPA STO) is, however, now asking, "Are there unexplored paradigms that might be superior to MANETS"? DARPA STO requests information on paradigm-shifting wireless communication and networking architectural concepts that enable scalable, high-performance, robust communications under high tempo mobility, diverse environmental conditions, and stringent size, weight, and power constraints, while providing reliable end-to-end security. These new paradigms may include the use of commercial wireless technology and/or concepts in radio resource management and hybrid architectural implementations. Concepts that are primarily minor augmentations or incremental modifications to the current MANET paradigm are not desired. 

INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS
This announcement is a request for white papers in support of developing innovative and creative mission-centric approaches that have potential for revolutionary improvements in communication capability at the tactical edge.

<SUBJECT>A--QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR JOINT MATERIAL DECONTAMINATION SYSTEM (JMDS) DRAFT RFP (PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION ONLY)
<SOLNBR>W911SR07R0002
<RESPDATE>012607
<ARCHDATE>03272007
<CONTACT>Mary Ann Mitchell, 410-436-0642
<DESC>THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED FOR THE JMDS DRAFT RFP STATEMENT OF WORK-----QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR THE PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION ARE INCLUDED IN A SEPARATE POSTING----- OFFERORS ARE REMINDED THAT THE DRAFT REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) DOCUMENTS CONSISTING OF THE STATEMENT OF WORK AND PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION FOR THE JMDS WERE PROVIDED SOLELY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES. THEY MAY BE REVISED AND OFFERORS ARE CAUTIONED TO ENSURE THEY UTILIZE THE FINAL VERSION OF THESE DOCUMENTS WHICH WILL BE POSTED WHEN THE FINAL RFP IS ISSUED. THE FINAL RFP WILL BE THE CONTROLLING DOCUMENT FOR PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS. IT WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE RESPONDENTS TO OBTAIN ALL AMENDMENTS AND APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS. QUESTION 1. Is the government expecting any units to be delivered at the conclusion of  Phase I (System Development and Demonstration)?  --ANSWER-- Yes, prototype unit quantity will be provided in the final Request for  Proposal(RFP). --QUESTION 2.How many units would be in Option 1 (LRIP)?--ANSWER--LRIP  quantity will be provided in the final RFP.  QUESTION 3.How many units would be delivered in Option 2 (Production)? --ANSWER--Production quantity will be provided in the final RFP.  QUESTION 4. Should the inspection criteria called out in C.3.17.8.1.1, which states that  20 of the first 50 units will be inspected, be carried on to further units?  Should this ratio  be maintained or does the contractor determine what ratio is suitable as is implied in  C.3.17.7? --ANSWER--No, only for the first 50 units.  The second part of this question will be  addressed in the final RFP. QUESTION 5.  Will the government provide a review and approval of the contractors  proposed system level specifications as called out in C.3.3.1.1? --ANSWER--Yes. QUESTION 6.When is the PDR to occur in relation to delivery of the contractors  proposed system level specifications? --ANSWER--PDR will be 30 calendar days after the delivery of the contractors  proposed system level specifications. QUESTION 7.Is there a time that the CDR should be scheduled in relation to the PDR? --ANSWER--No less than 30 calendar days after all deficiencies in the PDR are resolved. QUESTION 8.What is the anticipated period of performance for Part I? --ANSWER--24 months QUESTION 9.What is the anticipated period of performance for each option of Part II? --ANSWER--Option 1, 12 months.  Option 2, 40 months QUESTION 10. Option 1  LRIP C.3.16 - It would be most helpful if you could specify  the general scope of what this option means.  For example, most RFPs would include the  number of LRIP units required and the final acceptance tests to be performed.  Or you  might leave this option open and include a requirement to supply a detailed proposal later  in the program when the hardware is better defined. --ANSWER--LRIP quantity will be provided in the final RFP. QUESTION 11. Option 2  Production  C.3.17 - Again it would be helpful if you could  provide a total production quantity desired and rate of production.  If that cannot be  specified you might again want to delay receipt of detailed proposals until later in the  program or provide several production rates and final quantities and receive a multiple set  of production costs. --ANSWER--Production quantity will be provided in the final RFP. QUESTION 12. C.3.1.3 Data Management. The contractor shall establish a single,  centralized system for management of all data required under this contract. Clarification  Request: Are there any constraints from a security perspective with respect to access to a  contractors SDE?  Is a simple UserID and password sufficient in conjunction with  HTTPS, or is a two factor authentication approach required? To eliminate export  controls, is the SDE only going to be accessed by US Citizens? --ANSWER--A User ID and password to access a secure site is suffi cient.  The contractor  shall provide justification for non-U.S Citizens subject to approval by the governmenitive interiors for the decontamination process? --ANSWER--The offeror will present its solution to this requirement.  The Government  will not dictate the design of the system. QUESTION 11.	Para 3.3.10:  Is it expected that the decon chamber and other decon  modes will be operated simultaneously? --ANSWER--This question needs to be clarified.  No response can be provided at this  time.   QUESTION 12.	Para 3.3.10:  (c) Humidity:  There is no Procedure II under Method  507.4 of MIL-STD-810F.  Please clarify. --ANSWER--The paragraph will be revised to state procedures as listed. QUESTION 13.	Para 3.3.10:  (d) Fungus:  The Fungus test method in MIL-STD- 810F is numbered 508.5, not 508.4.  There is just one procedure (the terminology  Procedure I does not apply). --ANSWER--The paragraph will be revised to state procedures as listed. QUESTION 14.	Para 3.3.10:  (e) Salt Fog:  The Salt Fog test method in MIL-STD- 810F is numbered 509.4, not 509.3.  There is just one procedure (the terminology  Procedure I does not apply). --ANSWER--The paragraph will be revised to state procedures as listed. QUESTION 15.	Para 3.3.10:  (h) Vibration:  The Vibration test method in MIL- STD-810F is numbered 514.5, not 514.4.  Please provide further specification of the  desired vibration environment(s). --ANSWER--The correct test method number is 514.5.  The desired vibration  environment will be identified in the final RFP. QUESTION 16.	Para 3.3.10:  (i) Shipboard Vibration:  MIL-STD-167-1 has been  replaced by MIL-STD-167-1 and MIL-STD-167-2.  MIL-STD-167-1A is available, while  MIL-STD-167-2A is restricted.  Please provide clarification of the requirement and  further specification of the desired vibration environment. --ANSWER--The correct reference for Shipboard Vibration is MIL-STD-167-1A. QUESTION 17.	Para 3.3.10:  (k) Shipboard Shock:  The test specification called  out (MIL-STD-901) is titled Provisions for Evaluating Quality of Caps, Garrison, Mens  and doesnt appear to be applicable.  Perhaps the correct specification is MIL-S-901  (currently in Rev D).  Please provide further specification on the desired shock test  environment. --ANSWER--MIL-S-901D is the correct reference for Shipboard Shock. QUESTION 18.	Para 3.3.10:  (l) Rail Impact:  The Rail Impact test method in MIL- STD-810F is numbered 516.5, not 516.4.  This test requires an actual locomotive, a crew,  several rail cars, and a considerable length of track.  This seems an excessive  requirement, particularly for a technology development program.  Also, this test is more  appropriate to an item larger than that envisioned for the JMDS.  Is there a suitable  replacement shock test? --ANSWER--The correct reference for Rail Impact test method is 516.5.  Test  requirements (train, crew, etc) will be identified in the final RFP. QUESTION 19.	Para 3.3.10:  (m) Drop:  procedure IV of Method 516.5 in  MIL0STD-810F is intended for materiel that is to be packaged in a transit or combination  case.  Since the packaging offers some level of protection, the drop heights are  considerable higher than those for unpackaged materiel.  Is it envisioned that the JMDS  modules be packaged in protective transport containers for shipping and storage?  Does  this requirement apply if the JMDS is not packaged in protective shipping containers? --ANSWER--The JMDS shall not be damaged during or after transport.  The offeror may  propose any solution to meet this requirement. QUESTION 20.	Para. 3.3.12:  The JMDS configured for shipboard use will have  wheels and/or casters to be rolled across the floor by one person.  Is the intent that the  JMDS compatible for shipboard use be lifted through bulkheads in its fully assembled  form by one person, or may the JMDS be partially (and quickly) disassembled in to  component modules and then reassembled (quickly) in the next room to be  decontaminated?  Or, may two personnel be used to lift the JMDS through bulkheads?   The MIL-STD-1472F Table XVII weight limit is 44 lbs (male/female) or 87 lbs (male  only) for objects 18x18x12.  This size is appropriate for some JMDS modules but not the  system as a whole.  The sensitive equipment decontamination chamber alone will be  larger than this in order to achieve capacity (interior volume) and operational  environment requirements. --ANSWER--The configuration/hardware design shall comply with the MIL-STD.  The  offeror may propose any number of scalable systems, configurations, or hardware in  order to meet the Performance Specification.  However, fewer configurations would  equate to lower logistics and cost burden to the Government. QUESTION 21.	Para. 3.3.13: Reference to Shipboard Configuration.  How many  different configurations of JMDS are envisioned? --ANSWER--The offeror may propose any number of scalable systems, configurations,  or hardware in order to meet the Performance Specification.  However, fewer  configurations would equate to lower logistics and cost burden to the Government. QUESTION 22.	Para 3.5.2:  Please provide the Service Annex noted or indicate  where it may be obtained. --ANSWER--The JMDS program will not provide the Service Annexes.  References to  the Service Annexes will be removed from the Performance Specification. QUESTION 23.	Para 3.5.8 and 3.5.9: These preparation and replenishment  standards are quite low.  This means that for every 300 square feet, one would add 15  minutes of decontaminant preparation to 3his means that for every 300 square feet, one  would add 15 minutes of decontaminant preparation to 30 minutes of replenishment.   When combined with 15 minutes contact time and assuming 15 minutes application time,  the result is that is would take 1 hour and 15 minutes to decontaminate every 300 square  feet of surface. --ANSWER--This requirement is the desired capability threshold for set up time.  It is not  related to the decontamination process.  The offeror may provide a capability that uses  less time than stated in the threshold requirement. QUESTION 24.	Para 3.5.9:  How is the terminology resupply/replenish to be  interpreted?  If it means simply to refill decontaminant reservoirs, then the 30 minute and  15 minute times appear excessive.  What operational steps are envisioned to be  performed in this timeframe?  Does resupply/replenish mean instead to replace one  JMDS with another? --ANSWER--The term resupply/replenish refers to the process of refilling the  decontaminant reservoirs and also includes minor maintenance actions such as oil change  or filter change. The offeror may provide capability that uses less time than stated in the  threshold requirement. QUESTION 25.	Para 3.5.10:  This paragraph states that the JMDS applicators shall  have a ten-year shelf life.  What do they mean by applicators?  This is the only time that  this word appears in the performance spec and is not listed in the definitions.  --ANSWER--The JMDS system less the decontaminant is the definition of the applicator  in this paragraph.   QUESTION 26.	Para 3.5.14 and 3.5.18:  As above, 30 minutes for each of these  processes seems too long. --ANSWER--The 30 minutes requirement is as stated.    QUESTION 27.	Using the same basic technology, is it acceptable in this Program  to offer two or more different forms of hardware to satisfy different requirements?   Example:  Small piece part through decontamination may best be accomplished with a  closed environment.  Aircraft cockpit and interiors decontamination may be best  accomplished with a spray gun projection system. --ANSWER--Yes, the offeror may propose more than one hardware, configuration, or  scalable systems to meet different operational scenarios.  However, fewer configuration s  would equate to lower logistics and cost burden to the Government. QUESTION 28.	Paragraph 3.1.2. - Your Thorough Decontamination Efficacy is  well stated.  However, your Immediate-Operational Decontamination Efficacy is  confusing to us.You ask for vapors levels mg/m3 to be red

<RESPDATE>012607
<ARCHDATE>03272007
<CONTACT>Mary Ann Mitchell, 410-436-0642
<DESC>THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED FOR THE JMDS DRAFT RFP PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION-----QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR THE STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) ARE INCLUDED IN A SEPARATE POSTING----- OFFERORS ARE REMINDED THAT THE DRAFT REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) DOCUMENTS CONSISTING OF THE STATEMENT OF WORK AND PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION FOR THE JMDS WERE PROVIDED SOLELY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES. THEY MAY BE REVISED AND OFFERORS ARE CAUTIONED TO ENSURE THEY UTILIZE THE FINAL VERSION OF THESE DOCUMENTS WHICH WILL BE POSTED WHEN THE FINAL RFP IS ISSUED. THE FINAL RFP WILL BE THE CONTROLLING DOCUMENT FOR PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS. IT WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE RESPONDENTS TO OBTAIN ALL AMENDMENTS AND APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS. QUESTION 1.-Para. 1.2:  Are multiple or multi-component decontaminants permissible? --ANSWER--Yes. QUESTION  2.-Para. 1.4:  Please indicate where the Capability Development Documents  (CDD) for both the Joint Service Sensitive Equipment Decontamination (JSSED) and the  Joint Platform Interior Decontamination (JPID) can be obtained. --ANSWER--No, they will not be provided.  All references to the CDDs will be removed  from the performance specifications. QUESTION 3.	Para. 3.1:  Over what range of environmental conditions (temperature,  humidity, etc.) do the KPPs listed in this section apply in order to be judged successful at  the completion of Phase I? --ANSWER--Please reference MIL-STD-810F and Performance Spec paragraphs 3.3.8  thru 3.3.10 QUESTION 4.Para. 3.1.2:  Is there no decontamination level required for immediate- operational decontamination of biological agents? --ANSWER--No, there are no immediate and operational decontamination requirements  for biological agents. QUESTION 5.	Para 3.1.6: What is the significance of this requirement not being  identified as a KPP?  The wording of 3.1.7 suggests that the radioactive contamination is  particulate.  Are we to assume that the threat is an RDD and that the radioactivity will be  in particulate form only or will it also be liquid? --ANSWER--Requirements not identified as KPP are desired capabilities.  You may  assume that radioactive contaminants are in particulate form. QUESTION 6.	Para 3.1.8: This seems to conflict with 1.2, which states that NTAs are  part of Increment II.  Please clarify. --ANSWER--NTA is the threshold for Increment II.  TIC/TIM is objective for Increment  II QUESTION 7.	Para 3.3.2.  Why has the application coverage target been set so low?  A  rough calculation shows the interior surface area (including floor, ceiling, doors, and  seats) of a HMMWV to be in excess of 300 ft2.  The HMMWV interior certainly presents  one of the smaller surface areas among the items listed in Paragraph 1.2.  Mobile  maintenance facilities, aircraft (C-130, C-17, etc.), ships, and fixed site facilities will  certainly have significantly greater surface area.  From the standpoint of efficiency, it  would be better to maximize the surface area to be treated before refilling. --ANSWER--The 300 ft2 area is a minimum space desired for interior decontamination  such as the interior of a cockpit.  It is expected that space inside large cargo aircraft will  be significantly greater. QUESTION 8.Para 3.3.5: All of these detectors are chemical or radiological, yet JMDS is  also directed at biological threats.  Should the decontaminants also be non-interfering  with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based biological detectors? --ANSWER--The PCR based biological detectors is not a requirement.  QUESTION 9.	Para. 3.3.6:  Define standard decontamination procedures.  Are they  those of FM 3-11.5?  If not, please cite or provide the procedure(s).  What  decontaminants would be used? --ANSWER--Yes, please refer to existing decontamination guidance (FM 3-11.5). QUESTION 10.	Para 3.3.8: Most decontaminants will not be gaseous at the low  temperatures .  Therefore, does this requirement pertain to a system which will control the  temperature of these senst for  access onto the SDE. QUESTION 13.-C.3.3.3 Human Systems Integration. Clarification Request: Should the  contractor apply Human Systems Integration (HSI) per principles outlined in DoD  5000.2-R, Section C2.8.5 and C5.2.3.5.9. --ANSWER--The contractor should reference DoD 5000.2-R for HSI. QUESTION 14.--C.3.5.1.1 Configuration Status Accounting - The SOW requires that our  contractor CSA database be capable of providing CSA data in a digital format compatible  with Edgewood Chemical Biological Center's Product Data Management System  (PDMS). Clarification Request: We would like to provide this data directly from our  existing CM database tools wherever possible. Is it acceptable to provide it in contractor  format, using standard Microsoft Office products (e.g. Excel)? --ANSWER--Submission requirements will be included in issuance of final RFP. QUESTION 15.--C.3.5.3.2 Allocated Baseline - The SOW requires that this baseline be  established upon successful completion of the overall system CDR and that Government  approval is required prior to making changes to this baseline. Clarification Request: Per  contract requirements, the contractor will submit a JMDS Performance Specification  (B010) for Government approval - this document establishes the Functional Baseline.  Any change to this document requires Government approval. There is no requirement in  the SOW, however, to submit Allocated Baseline documents (such as CI Development  Specifications). Is it acceptable to allow the contractor to control the allocated baseline  (using a Requirements Management Tool) and only seek Government approval when the  allocated baseline change impacts the JMDS Performance Spec? --ANSWER--Yes, the contractor may control the allocated baseline and seek government  approval for changes impacting the performance specification until the System  Verification Review. QUESTION 16.--	C.3.5.5 Configuration Control. The contractor shall implement  configuration control methods and procedures, which maintain the integrity and  traceability of an established baseline. Changes to established baselines shall only be  made after Government approval of ECP and Request for Deviation (RFD). The  contractor shall submit ECPs, RFDs, or Notice of Revisions (NORs) utilizing the  Edgewood Chemical Biological Centers Product Data Management System (PDMS).  Clarification Request:  Is there a time requirement that the government needs to respond  to change requests?  --ANSWER--The Government response time for the respective ELINs will be identified  on the Contract Data Requirements List, DD Form 1423, to be provided in the final RFP.    QUESTION 17.  --C.3.5.5.3 Request for Deviation- Clarification Request: Critical and  major deviation/waivers will be submitted under ELIN B004. Is it acceptable to use our  contractor Material Review Board to disposition minor waivers, rather than submitting  them under ELIN B004?  --ANSWER--No.  The contractor shall submit RFDs (minor) as required by the SOW and  ELIN B004.  (MIL-HDBK-61A provides guidance.) QUESTION 18.-ELIN B006, DI-SESS-81000C Product Drawings/Models and  Associated Lists & ELIN B007, DI-SESS-81003C, Commercial Drawings/Models and  Associated Lists. Clarification Request: Will TDP (Technical Data Package) Option  Selection Worksheets (per MIL-DTL-31000C) be provided in the RFP?  --ANSWER--Yes.  Worksheets will be provided as an attachment to the DD Forms 1423. QUESTION 19.-C.3.6.3 Reliability Testing and Reports. The contractor shall conduct  reliability testing using MIL-HDBK-781A as a guide. The contractor shall provide test  results IAW ELIN A014 (DI-TMSS-81586).

This precludes consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/SIO has identified the VM Certified, Server Blade Storage Area Network Solution as a key component of the Departments Oracle-based Enterprise Services Bus, which will be used to meet domestic and overseas information sharing requirements.  This RAID-based, certified SOA solution will provide the most significant of several major components required for a robust, fully functioning, and enterprise-scale Enterprise Services Bus.   ).    As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein are the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments information sharing requirements.  The VM Certified, Server Blade Storage Area Network Solution has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>

<DESC>CLS FOR C-20 AIRCRAFT FLEET
Potential Source Sought


Description:
This is a Small Business Set-Aside Acquisition. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The U.S. Air Force through the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) is conducting research to determine the existence of potential business sources interested in providing support for the U.S. Government C-20 fleet of 20 Gulfstream III, IV, and IVSP aircraft as described in the following paragraphs beginning 01 Nov 2003.  These aircraft belong to the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force, and are designated C-20B/C/D/E/G/H.  These aircraft are FAA certified and maintained commercial aircraft modified to meet DoD requirements in various specific configurations, and are powered by Rolls Royce Spey and Tay engines.  They are configured to accommodate 12 to 14 passengers and a crew of five.  The C-20 aircraft are located at four Main Operating Base (MOBs): Ramstein AB GE (C-20H),  Hickam AFB HI (C-20E), Marine Corp Base Hawaii at Kaneohe Bay HI (C-20G), and Andrews AFB MD (C-20B/D/E/G).  The aircraft at Ramstein, Hickam, Kaneohe Bay and Army C-20s at Andrews AFB are supported by full CLS (supply and organizational maintenance).  Partial CLS (supply support only) is provided for Navy and Air Force C-20s at Andrews AFB.  The Navy provides their own organizational maintenance at Andrews AFB and the Air Force replaces their organizational maintenance at Andrews AFB with a base contractor that is not associated with this contract.  Spare parts and support equipment maintained in the Contractor Operated and Maintenance Base Supply (COMBS) located at each MOB are government-owned.  The COMBS at Andrews AFB provides supply support to all the C-20s based at Andrews.  In addition to the MOB supply and maintenance support, the new contract will include a requirement for depot maintenance (scheduled and unscheduled) and depot field team support worldwide for the C-20 airframe, engine, accessories, and avionics.  The depot support shall include all inspections and maintenance required by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the government (DoD and FAA).  The depot maintenance requirement will also include complete airframe paint removal, corrosion control and repaint, as required by the applicable service, as well as security for all C-20 aircraft in depot.  The government requires the contractor to provide a detailed critical path delivery schedule for all aircraft inducted for scheduled depot maintenance.  Delivery schedules will also be required for long-term unscheduled depot maintenance.  These schedules will be required within minimum times after aircraft induction.  Source interested in this requirement should express this in writing to: OC-ALC/PSKBB; ATTN: Rhonda Provence; 3001 Staff Drive Ste 1AC4 106A, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3020; fax (405) 739-2378.  Email address: Rhonda.Provence@tinker.af.mil.  No telephone requests.  Only written, faxed, or via e-mail requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable.

<DESC>FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except  as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection  31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying potential  sources capable of creating and completing learning initiatives for a wide  range of DoD customers/sponsors.                                REQUEST FOR INFORMATION                            (with Capabilities Requirement) 1.0	Description of Request 1.1.	 Introduction The Air Force Institute of Technology School of Systems and Logistics  (AFIT/LS) requests information regarding interest in and the capability to  create and complete learning initiatives for a wide range of DoD  customers/sponsors. 1.2. Background 1.2.1.  AFIT/LS has a need to develop a series of learning initiatives  (e.g. courses).  AFIT/LS requires between 8-12 courses to be developed  annually, although the actual number may vary.  Each courses length,  content and interactivity level is expected to vary as well.  The courses  shall be designed for adult learners and cover a host of current topics  needed for professionals in the weapon system acquisition and sustainment  career fields.  AFIT/LS will use a Curriculum Development Team approach  with cross functional experts involved throughout the process such that  questions can be quickly answered and material quickly provided as needed  by the developing contractor. 1.2.2. Development of each course will be based on a series of experiences  and challenges, combined with education and training opportunities that  enable the learners to grow and succeed professionally as well as meet Air  Force needs. 1.3. Objective 1.3.1.  The objective of this effort is to provide AFIT a task order  contract vehicle to expediently purchase these development services as the  customer needs arise.  AFIT points of contact (AFIT POC) will provide  detailed requirement packages throughout the contract period of  performance for each order.  Each AFIT POC shall be the responsible  liaison between the course sponsor and the contractor. 1.3.2.  All projects shall acquire development and technical services in  support of learning initiatives.  Learning initiatives may include, but  are not limited to, computer-based (CBT), web-based (e-learning),  video-based and blended (combined) and even potentially  live/classroom-based courses.  Vendors are encouraged to propose new  leading edge technologies, such as pod casting and others not yet defined.  Development services include the creation of presentation materials (web  based, videos, audio, or other media). 2.0. Capability Statement 2.1.  An interested party's capability statement must demonstrate  extensive experience with, and ability to develop the kind of course  described in this RFI.  The interested party should also demonstrate  extensive experience in Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)  requirements as well as Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities  Act.  Responses to this RFI must contain the following information: (1) an  extensive summary of the partys relevant current and prior work, (2)  description of any potential conflicts of interest the party may have in  performing the work, (3) a brief description of the partys quality  control processes for deliverables, (4) references (name and contact  information) for whom the party has performed similar work, (5) a one-page  corporate summary including the interested partys web site, and (6) a  listing of any current negotiated GSA schedules, Government contracts, or  commercial pricing rates. 2.2.  The Government will conduct market analysis by reviewing each vendors  capability statement.  Any entity responding to this RFI should ensure  that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the  Government to determine the entitys qualifications to perform.  The  Government will evaluate all submissions for responsiveness to this  announcement. 2.3.  This is a RFI announcement only.  This is not a request for proposal  and in no way commits the Government to award a contract.  The Government  does not intend to award a contract(s) based solely on responses to this  RFI, nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this  RFI. 2.4.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly  voluntary and will be used only for the purpose of conducting market  analysis.  Proprietary and Confidential Information will not be accepted.  The Government believes that standard specifications and capabilities  should be sufficient to respond.  If a vendor believes that their response  must include proprietary or confidential information in order to be  properly considered, they should notify the point of contact listed below. 2.5.  Interested parties should address all questions via email to  Thomas.Moseley@wpafb.af.mil.  All questions submitted will be posted to  the PIXS and FedBizOpps web sites.

(2) How many people does your company employ?  (3) How many TS/SCI cleared personnel are currently available?  (4) Will you need to hire additional personnel to perform this effort?  (5) Is your company's cost accounting system approved by DCAA or DCMC?  If not, how would your company financially administer a cost-reimbursement type contract?  (6) Are there any other factors concerning your company's ability to perform the upcoming effort that the Air Force should consider? 

 Respondents are requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.  Large businesses are also encouraged to submit e-mails of intent should this effort not be selected as a small business set-aside.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Wyoming is seeking sources for food catering services to use at fire camps during the 2007 fire season in Wyoming. Food prepreation would include breakfast, sack lunch, and dinner.  A seating tent, chairs, kitchen, and food are requested to serve 50 to 150 people per meal.  Rate will be negotiated for each meal type (breakfast rate, lunch rate, and dinner rate).  In addition to meal rates, compensation would included travel and setup costs. The typical area of service would be a 150-mile radius around Casper, Wyoming, but could be anywhere in the state.  The BLM would establish a "pre-contract" before the fire season called an Emergency Equipment Rental Agreement (EERA).  Dispatchers, Incident Contracting Officers, or buying teams at the site would issue a resource order when fire incidents occur.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. MARKET SURVEY  SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division is seeking information pertaining to lightweight armor protection.  The system needs to work around the existing USN small craft tripod assembly (MK16 Mod9), stand (MK16 Mod8), and post mounted crew served weapons.  The armor system should be easily integrated to the existing tripod, stand, or post mount and should require minimal to no additional deck mounted provisions.  The system must allow the gunner to train, elevate, and depress the weapon in the gun mount.  It is also desired to integrate a solution that would allow the armor protection system to move with the gunner and provide support and restraint while the craft is in motion and while firing.  However, it is not intended for the system to support the weight of the gunner.  The requirement is for 360 degree protection for the weapons operator or as close as possible.  The armor system should provide protection from threats zero to thirty (0-30) degrees from horizont!  al and extend from the deck to above the neck of the gunner.  Depending on the craft configuration, the height of the armor required may be less.  The armor should not interfere with any of the gunners normal personnel protective equipment such as ballistic vests, LBE, helmets, etc.  The level of protection required of the lightweight armor is to stop 7.62 x 51mm NATO ball ammunition.  The armor should be relatively easy to attach and remove and can be hinged for attachment and storability.  Favorable consideration will be given to lighter weight materials or installations without sacrificing performance.  Cost is also a consideration. This sources sought announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement or incurred for participation in the pre-solicitation conference will NOT be reimbursed.

<CONTACT>Clarence Campbell at 850-234-4853 , or Contracting Officer Mary Hines at 850-235-5389.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida is seeking information on composite adaptable pitch propeller blades for the Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC).  The application is for use on US Navy Hovercraft, and may also have potential for the LCAC replacement craft- the Joint Maritime Assault Connector (JMAC).  This search is not restricted to current approaches or systems used in the maritime environment.  It does include any adaptable pitch technology, potentially suited for the above application used in diverse maritime as well as land environments. NSWC Panama City is interested in already-developed technology that can provide LCAC propeller blades capable of passively adapting pitch angle in response to fluctuating loads and inlet airflow.  The desired blades will twist in response to changing loads in order to provide a more even load distribution and alleviate issues with uneven inflow to the propellers due to various flow blockages.  In the design optimization phase it will be required to dynamically predict the blade shape under load and design the fiber layouts accordingly, then conventional composite methods will be used for fabrication.  The potential benefits are 1) reduced flow-induced vibration for fewer fatigue-related maintenance issues 2) reduced acoustic noise for lower acoustic signature and 3) improved efficiency providing increased thrust at current horsepower levels.  To foster competition and help lower procurement costs, the Navy will also consider non-adaptable, direct-replacement composite propel!  ler blades. This announcement will serve as a first step for evaluating alternatives and supporting In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) research and development efforts. Systems could be acquired in the future for Test and Evaluation for future LCAC ISEA installation.  Both off-the-shelf and developmental approaches will be considered.   Responses to this announcement should include a technical description and detailed characteristics of the Adaptable Pitch Propellers for use on the Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC). System descriptions should have enough information for the government to make informed decisions.  Information submitted shall be marked with restrictive legends as deemed appropriate by the potential offeror. Data with restrictive markings will be handled in accordance with the restrictions thereto.   Interested firms must provide electronic submittals in MS Word or Adobe Acrobat format.  Only prime contractors should respond. Responses to this Sources Sought should be sent to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Code E32, ATTN: John Ducote, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001, or email: john.ducote@navy.mil. Information is to be received by the Government not later than 7 Mar 2007.  Technical questions should be directed to Mr. John Ducote at (850) 235-5388 (email john.ducote@navy.mil). The Government will evaluate the submittals for their potential to reduce the cost of LCAC ISEA efforts.  Organizations that submit materials/designs, which are determined by the evaluation team as possessing significant potential for contributing to the solution of the LCAC Maintenance problem, may be provided an opportunity to demonstrate their system.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or to ultimately !  award a contract. In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be published on the Navy Electronic Commerce online (NECO), Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), and NSWC PC intranet.  NAICS  332999, PSC AC33, Standard Business Size: 750 employees.

The Munitions Facilities construction project consists of four separate buildings.  The proposed sites for the new buildings are located in the existing Munitions Facilities Compound on the northeastern portion of the base.  The site area is defined by an existing secured perimeter chain-link fence and includes munitions and equipment storage areas.   

The Munitions Administration/Mobility Storage Building combines administrative and storage functions.  The Munitions Administration/Mobility Storage Building consists of approximately 6960 SF of administrative space and 8042 SF of high bay storage for a total of 15,002 SF gross building area.  The new facility will be constructed utilizing a pre-engineered building structure with a 3:12 pitch metal roof and metal siding.  A 4 ft height, split-face CMU wainscot will be provided around the administration portion of the new facility.  The remainder of the exterior wall will consist of pre-engineered metal panels.  Interior partitions in the administration area will be metal studs with gypsum board.  Floors will be carpet in the offices and VCT in the corridors and break rooms.  Restrooms and locker rooms will have ceramic tile floors.  The storage bays consist of twelve bays (55 ft x 12 ft) for trailer storage and space for training functions.  Demolition of Buildings 1800, 1801, and 1803 will be required before construction is started on the new building.  Demolition of Buildings 1805 and 1807 will be deferred until construction is complete on the new building in order to phase the occupancy of the administration areas.  The total demolition area is 5000 SF 

The Four-Bay Maintenance Facility contains approximately 3784 SF of administrative space and 5166 SF of munitions maintenance area consisting of four drive-through bays for a total of approximately 8950 SF.  Three of the walls separating the bays will be Substantial Dividing Walls or Blast Walls, which are required for prevention of propagation of burning reactions.  The new facility will be constructed utilizing a pre-engineered building structure with a 3:12 pitch metal roof and metal siding.    Interior partitions in the administration area will be metal studs with gypsum board.  Floors will be carpet in the offices and VCT in the corridors and break rooms.  Restrooms and locker rooms will have ceramic tile floors.  Specialized equipment in the maintenance bays includes low and high-pressure air and 400hz power for support of portable air ground equipment.  A catenary lightning protection will be provided for the Four-Bay Maintenance Facility.

The third and fourth buildings are each 2080 square foot munitions storage igloos.  The storage igloos will have reinforced concrete bearing walls with reinforced concrete roof, floor and foundation systems.  The structures will be earth covered and will feature blast-resistant steel doors, explosion-proof lighting, exterior security lighting, an intrusion detection system, and a catenary lightning protection system.

The work for each new building includes communication and fire protection systems, all supporting utilities, and site work consisting of parking aprons, access drives, and landscaping.  The estimated cost of this acquisition is between $6,000,000 and $6,750,000.

Description
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICITATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THE RFI.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES TO THIS RFI.

The Global Positioning Systems Wing (formerly, NAVSTAR GPS Joint Program Office) is seeking to identify and obtain information from responsible sources who have proven hardware that can meet all requirements of CI-GRAM-500A and Addendum 1 and should fully support the IS-GPS-167 interface. Additionally, the hardware should be capable of Direct-Y initial acquisition of the GPS signal-in-space.  For RFI purposes, the term proven means hardware that is developed and is ready for fielding or is already fielded, and only requires integration as a developmental aspect.

The Government may acquire for testing purposes one or more vendor products. Foreign equipment will be evaluated for suitability. This evaluation will be used to determine cost and performance trade-offs for hardware/software associated with these devices., Vendors must have adequate fabrication and test facilities to warrant pre-production testing and limited procurement of component items. Responses are requested of those suppliers who can provide working hardware ready for test and demonstration purposes on or about 01 January 2006. Responses to this market survey are due on or before February 22, 2007 and must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, indication of the technology readiness level or maturity of the technology, summary of prior testing, test reports, an estimated schedule and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units. Please provide name of firm, address, POC, phone/fax number, and email address.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:

This is a request for information only.  There is no solicitation package available.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is seeking information from industry that will assist in the assessment of new technology for the purpose of gas turbine engine testing. This information will also assist the Navy in formulating its requirements for a Turbo Prop Test Instrumentation (TPTI) System to be developed in support of Intermediate Level (I-level) testing of various versions of the T56 turboprop engine.

BACKGROUND:

The functional capability of the TPTI System will be based on existing family testers for FanJet engines (JETI) and Shaft engines (SETI).  These testers are Personal Computer (PC) based test system designed to provide enhanced computer based measurement and automated data acquisition and control for the purpose of Intermediate (I-Level) testing.
The existing engine testers (JETI/SETI) consist of (1) Power conditioning and distribution sufficient to provide clean battery-backed power from a range of AC input sources and generate all AC and DC power requirements; (2) rack-mount, ruggedized PCs; (3) Computer-based instrumentation which satisfies engine signal and test requirements (e.g. speed, accuracy, resolution); (4) engine adapter hardware, interface cables, and signal conditioning required for conveyance of engine signals; (5) transducers for conversion of physical signals into electrical form (e.g. vibration accelerometers, pressure transducers, thermocouples, etc.); and (6) an independent throttle system (dual throttle configuration in SETI, single throttle configuration in JETI).

These systems are similar in that they are employ VXI form factor instrumentation which interface with and are controlled from an external PC.  The computer systems are standard Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based ruggedized PC(s), running Windows-based operating system.  The computers communicate with the instrumentation via industry-standard protocols (e.g. VXI, LXI VISA, IVI, IEEE-802.3, etc.).  Engine application software is written with National Instrument's LabView product.  The systems share a common architecture both in hardware, software and the look and feel of the user interface.

Existing systems (JETI and SETI) accommodate over 100 channels of A/D type analog inputs including 48 channels of thermocouples and 36 pressure channels; 8 channels of frequency input, 9 channels of vibration signals, 112 channels of discrete inputs, 152 channels of discrete output (relays); 2 channels of timing/frequency, 2 channels of MIL-STD 1553 in JETI, and ARINC 429 in SETI.  The data acquisition process acquires all channels at approximately 100Hz and 200Hz for JETI and SETI respectively.  The Engine Test Program software communicates with the data acquisition to perform instrument setup and configuration and transfer acquired data as required to support engine test requirements.

PURPOSE OF REQUEST:

As with any COTS based instrumentation and control system, obsolescence concerns with both hardware and software exist as a result of market driven technological advances. The government, therefore, is requesting information from industry suppliers of gas turbine engine test systems and subsystems that employ the latest in technology that may meet our requirement for a turboprop engine tester. All suppliers with an appropriate product relating the requirement for gas turbine engine testing are invited to submit a Capability Statement and contact information. The Capability Statement should discuss the products capabilities set against the present JETI/SETI system configurations, potential TPTI requirements, and any other specific or pertinent information that would enhance the Navys understanding of the information submitted

With this information, the Navy will have an industry perspective on the latest technical architecture alternatives that will allow for a more informed technical feasibility alternatives assessment. 

HOW TO RESPOND:

All interested parties should send company and/or descriptive literature as well as any comments or questions to Ms. Veronica Anderson, e-mail: veronica.anderson@navy.mil, fax: (732) 323-2800 or address: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Contracts, Code 25211VA 562-3, Hwy 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082.  All responses should be received no later than 3:00 PM EST, 6 February 2007.  All questions and comments must be in writing, no telephone calls.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to the use of modular/deployable windmill technology to augment Tent City power requirements at deployed locations.  The goal of this RFI is to find lighter, leaner and cheaper ways to generate power.  The system must meet the following requirements:

?	Able to operate in austere environments (areas with limited support infrastructure)
?	Include a power storage/management system and information regarding its capabilities
?	Capable of interfacing with 60Hz, 120AC power grid 
?	Lightweight, easy to transport, assemble and disassemble

Note: Use 3KW as the typical power consumption rate for one 32? x 20? tent.  At this time, we don?t have a specific number of tents the system must help support.  A typical Air Force diesel power generator produces 60KW and supports 20 tents.  The most common pallet used to transport these generators is the 463L which measures 88? x 108? and has a weight capacity of 10,000 lbs.

<DESC>Background
TRU waste was shipped to the NTS from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) through the early 1980s in 58 oversize boxes (OSBs).  These boxes cannot be shipped offsite under current shipping regulations and must be repacked.  

The OSBs are constructed of steel.  They are various shapes and sizes, depending on the contents.  All of the boxes are unvented metal containers.  Eighteen of the boxes have lids that are bolted and the remaining 40 boxes are all welded construction.  The boxes have been sealed for approximately 30 years.  It is possible that hydrogen, methane, or other flammable volatile organic compounds (VOCs) may have built up either from radiolysis or from inorganic/organic decomposition.  Because of the time frame involved (30 years), oxygen is expected to be depleted.  

Scope of Work
Technical support and equipment shall be provided by the vendor to vent the OSBs, prior to any OSB size reduction and repackaging activities.  All hands-on labor will be provided by the Contractor.  The preferred fittings to be used are the Rapid-Port dart type produced by Nuclear Filter Technologies (NFT).  

Once the box is vented, a sample of the headspace gas will be manually pulled through a filter septum and analyzed for hydrogen and flammable gas concentrations using vendor provided equipment.  In the event that the concentrations are at or above acceptable limits, the boxes will be allowed to aspirate and/or be purged with nitrogen until concentration levels decrease below levels of concern.  Additional sampling may be required.  The analysis for headspace gas is for safety purposes only regarding flammability, concentration and explosive limits.  

Requirements
1.	The vendor will provide a remote drum/box vent system that has been demonstrated at DOE sites across the country with full time technical operational support.  The vent system must be suitable for installing Nucfil Rapid-Port dart-type vents/filters (or WIPP approved equivalent).  The vendor will provide a GCMS (or equivalent) for headspace gas analysis along with technical operational support and any required spare parts and supplies.
2.	Minimum 10 years demonstrated experience using proven technology with remote drum/box vent systems for venting radioactive drums/boxes containing hydrogen and flammable gases at DOE sites across the country. 
3.	Demonstrated experience analyzing headspace gas samples using Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GCMS) technology (or equivalent) for hydrogen and flammable gases at DOE sites across the country. 
4.	Vendor must have a minimum of 10 years experience working in nuclear facilities across the DOE complex and successful operational readiness review (ORR) experience.

<RESPDATE>013107
<ARCHDATE>04012007
<CONTACT>Christopher Heim, 508 233 6328
<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command, Special Operations Forces Survival Systems office is seeking a commercial off the shelf (COTS) communications headset suite with the following functions: Must contain a circum-aural high noise headset, inner aural (ear bud type) high noise system, and a system for use in low noise (provides no hearing protection) environments.   Each system must allow the operator to simultaneously monitor and selectively transmit on two radios and an ICS system.  ICS system plug ins must have a quick disconnect capability. Any test reports outlining testing performed in reference to sound localization and other acoustical performance measures is highly desired in reference to both the circum-aural and inner aural high noise systems. All headsets must be compatible with the following radio platforms: PSC-5D,  AN/PRC117D, AN/PRC117F, 119E,  PRC 150, PRR, JEM, MBITR Land.  If systems are not confirmed on any of these radio platforms, the government requests that the vendor identify the shortfall. All headsets must be compatible with ICS systems on the following platforms: GMV USASFC, GMV 75th, Stryker Vehicle,  Bradley Vehicle, AC-13,0 MH53, MH53E, CH-46E, CH53D, CH53E, CH47, MH-53, MH-47D, MH47E, MH47F, MH60G, AH-6J, Osprey, MC 130, C17, RG31, MKV  ,MC-130.   If systems are not confirmed on any of these radio platforms, the government requests that the vendor identify the shortfall. If Active noise reduction (ANR) is used in the high noise systems  there must be the capability to selectively turn on and off the ANR. High noise systems must provide for listen and talk capabilities in a high noise environment to include passive sound attenuation to protect the wearer from both steady state and impulse noise, while allowing the user to hear ambient ear-safe noises that h e would hear with the naked ear.  It is also desirable to provide amplification of those ambient sounds.  Multiple components may be necessary to accomplish this objective, but fewer components with more capabilities are desirable. It is desired but not required to have personal computer interface through IP protocols. The low noise headset must allow for listen and talk in low noise environments with an unobtrusive microphone and speaker system that minimizes interference with acoustic hearing, peripheral vision, and/or other worn equipment. Vendor submissions will be expected to perform reliably in all standard Special Operations Forces RF environments.  200v/m survivability is desired. The entire system must be Waterproof 3 ft, 30 min saltwater in its as worn configuration. All inner aural high noise systems must have a non-custom molded ear bud.  It is a desire to have the ability to upgrade to custom molded ear buds in the inner aural headset. All headset must have a quick disconnect between the headset and the PTT.	 In terms of PTT activation toggle switches are not preferred.  Push buttons with a non-audible tactile response are preferred.   A wireless PTT is desired if capable of meeting all NSA and DOD criteria. Vendors with modular designs which would allow the operator to tailor the components, based on the operational scenarios, to the most appropriate configuration for mission accomplishment is highly desired. Vendor submissions should cause no significant increase to the detectable signature, i.e. IR, visible, audible, etc, of the operator/platform. Vendor submissions must be as low profile and close to the head as possible to prevent the fatigue associated with poor weight distribution. Vendor submissions must not significantly obstruct peripheral vision. Headset systems must fit the standard 5th to 95th percentile male. Must be compatible when worn with NBC mask(s) such as the  M45, M50 and M53 with their hoods.   Vendor submissions must not interfere with the wearing of the Basic Helmet and will not interfere with cheek to stock weld when firing rifles, machineguns and carbines. The vendor  submissions must allow the operator to wear components together as a system or each component separately.  (i.e., the Communications Package must be wearable and functional with or without the Basic Helmet) while being night vision, communications and Nuc lear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) equipment compatible.  Other compatibility requirements for vendor submissions include head mounted night observation devices, High Altitude Parachutist Mask, and standard commercial eye protection goggles/glasses. All external surfaces must be rust and salt water resistant and finished in a flat neutral color that is non-reflective. Vendor submissions must be able to operate in temperature ranges between -40 to +130 degrees Fahrenheit with a storage range of -40 to +160. Army standard or commercially equivalent batteries will power components if necessary.  It is desirable that no integral power be necessary for components to function.  A threshold battery life of 200 hours is required, with 300 hours as an objective, give n a 7/1 receive to transmit ratio. Vendor submissions configured to accept technology upgrades through open architectures are desired. Operator Maintenance for submissions should be limited to that necessary for routine cleansing and replacement of batteries and spares and/or easily replaced components  Vendor submissions should include any equipment training packages or use and care instructions necessary to advise a novice operator in the respective systems operation/maintenance. Vendor submissions will be expected to operate reliably for 10 hours per day during a 10-day mission profile without spares or logistical support.  As an objective, the system must operate reliably for 10 hours per day during a 20-day mission profile witho ut spares or logistical support. Publications or contractor documentation for each level of operation and repair will include illustrated parts breakdown, parts listings, theory of operations and maintenance troubleshooting guides.   A tentative pre-solicitation conference will likely occur in March 2007 at a location to be determined.   Interested parties should reply to point of contact listed below no later than 31 January 2007. All responding sources shall provide a summary of their companys capabilities including organizations, name/address/point of contact identification, capabilities, a description of facilities/equipment, manufacturing process, inspection capability, personn el, past experience, proven monthly production capacity and/or potential capability; possible partnering/teaming arrangements; and whether the company is a small or large business.    Any feedback on the contents of the proposed equipment are encouraged.

<SUBJECT>B -- Operational Loads Monitoring System -(LMS)
<DESC>The U.S. Forest Service is contemplating the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) in the near future for the purchase of Operational Loads Monitoring System (OLMS) equipment and the installation on Contractor and Government-owned aircraft involved in aerial firefighting for the purpose of determining aerodynamic operational loads experienced within the low level fire suppression environment.  The purpose of this interest announcement is to obtain market research on interested vendors and the business size standards of the interested vendors. 

During fire fighting operations, the workload for both the air and ground crew is quite intense.  Therefore, the recording system installed on these aircraft must rely on minimal intervention by the flight and/or ground crews for data acquisition, supplemental data collection and merging and finally the data transfer to the Forest Service contracted server on which the Library Database resides.

Operational Loads Monitoring System (OLMS) Requirements.  A OLMS is comprised of all equipment required for recording to acquire, record and transmit required parameters (Table 1) as experienced by a firefighting aircraft during flight operations. 

? All material and components shall meet or exceed appropriate aircraft specifications and be installed by appropriately rated FAA entities.

? Sample data shall be furnished to ensure compatibility with data requirements in the Forest Service operational loads Library Database software solution supplied by nCode International under contract to the US Forest Service. 

?The OLMS Recorder shall have the capability of recording up to 100 flight hours of data, monitoring up to sixteen (16) continuous parameters and eight (8) discrete parameters.

? Desirable System Attributes
o Crashworthy data storage.
o Wireless Data Upload.

<SUBJECT>A -- Real-time Acoustic Imaging Device for Read Out of Sensor Arrays
<DESC>The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has developed a Laser Ultrasonic Microscope, which allows for rapid full field real-time imaging of micro sized devices, including arrays of sensors or surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices.  These micro arrays include arrays of quartz crystal microbalances, surface acoustic wave transducers, and thin film bulk linear and/or torsional acoustic resonators wherein the factor that causes a response may be biological, chemical, physical, material, thermal, acoustic, electromagnetic and/or combinations thereof.  

INL?s acoustic imaging technique utilizes a laser to illuminate the entire surface of a vibrating object and a camera to read information about the vibration amplitude and phase everywhere on the surface of the object. This is accomplished when a reflected laser light is combined with a reference beam to perform dynamic holographic image processing in a photorefractive material such as Bismuth Silicon Oxide (BSO). The interaction between the light and the photorefractive material demodulates the vibration information, and displays this information as a gray scale image. Each point or pixel on the image corresponds to a point on the surface of the vibrating surface of the object and the pixel intensity is directly proportional to the amplitude of the vibration at that point. Thus, a image is produced of the distribution of vibrational amplitudes everywhere on the surface, all at once, without scanning.

When the vibrating object is a collection of individual vibrating structures the INL technology displays a complex vibration distribution where one or more pixels is assigned to each vibrating subunit. If these subunits are individual sensors in an array of micro-vibratory chemical sensors, then one can directly detect the individual resonant frequencies. This information can be recorded by a video camera, digitized and displayed, stored or used for further analysis. 

The INL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms interested in participating in projects and commercializing this technology.  It is anticipated that the project will be carried out through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with funding support being provided by the participant(s).  The INL has several patents on the process.  See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,827,971, 6,134,006, 6,175,411, 6,486,962, and 6,401,540.  See also published U.S. Patent Application Nos. 10/267,320, 10/267,237, and 11/130,853.  These patents may be licensed exclusively or non-exclusively.  The INL invites interested parties to contact us regarding the details of licensing and implementing this technology into an operation.  Interested parties should respond on or before within 90 days from the date of posting.  For questions regarding this technology, licensing, and working with the INL, please contact Jason Stolworthy:

<SUBJECT>B--Conservation Strategy for the Tahoe Yellow Cress
<DESC>The Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit of the U.S. Forest Service anticipates awarding a non-competitive contract to BMP Ecosciences for the continuation of the implementation of the Conservation Strategy for the Tahoe Yellow Cress (Rorippa subumbellata) (Pavlik et al. 2002).  The strategy outlines goals and objectives intended to facilitate recovery of Tahoe yellow cress, improve populations, and guide management and conservation activities to secure its survival into the future and to prevent the need to list the species under the Federal Endangered Species Act and allow the States of Nevada and California to downlist or delist this species under their respective endangered species acts.

This program of work is a continuation of activities performed by BMP Ecosciences that commenced in 2000 with the drafting the Tahoe yellow cress Conservation Strategy (CS).  These activities have included collection of seed, oversight of nursery activities (propagation and maintenance), experimental design and implementation of mitigation studies, continued implementation and monitoring of outplanting/translocation studies, continued water relations study, development of a survey protocol that will detect sustainable metapopulation dynamics, and fulfilling reporting requirements as specified under the strategy.  Implementation is expected to continue through 2010.

The key management questions and research and adaptive management framework for Tahoe yellow cress were also developed by BMP Ecosciences.  They have provided the necessary scientific expertise for the experimental design and implementation of statistically robust studies on the ground.  

Project activities specific to this contract will include an expanded analysis and interpretation of TYC data collected between 2003 and 2006, which will provide insight into the effects of genetics, microhabitat, and water relations on plant performance. Experimental reintroduction and restoration trials that were initiated in 2002 will continue, as well as collaboration with the Adaptive Management Working Group (AMWG), Technical Advisory Group (TAG), and Executive Committee. Three draft manuscripts will be prepared with the final goal of publication in a peer reviewed journal. These manuscripts will highlight the significant findings, processes, and lessons learned from the Tahoe yellow cress project over the past four years.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Vendors believing they can meet this requirement must submit written information showing clearly that they are able to meet the requirements stated above.  All information must be received no later than 2:00 p.m. (PST) on March 5, 2007.  Mail to Attn: Contracting Department, Tahoe National Forest, 631 Coyote Street, Nevada City, CA., or fax to 530-478-6126.

1)	The Ti:Saph laser?s electrical and cooling system must be compatible with the Coherent V18 Nd:YAG.  
2)	The laser must deliver >3.5 Watts of  CW power with no more than 1.75% rms noise from 10Hz to 1 GHz when pumped by a Coherent Verdi V18 Nd:YAG laser.
3)	The laser must have electronic locking for single-longitudinal-mode output.  Tuning must be from 700nm to 1100nm, and must include broadband optics, enabling us to change wavelength without changing all the internal mirrors.
4)	Must use Brewster plates to change wavelength.  
5)	Must have a monolithic resonator block-one piece to maintain system alignment and stability.
6)	Must have a bowtie cavity containing no more than four mirrors.  More mirrors will introduce greater losses in our laser power, and decrease beam stability.    
7)	The pump diode delivery fiber must be single-core multimode to provide a homogenized pump beam independent of any emitter to emitter power changes at the diode output face.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), within USAID, is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in responding to international crises and disasters.  To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established five permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office.  The regional offices are located in San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; and Pretoria, South Africa.  The sub-regional office is in Kathmandu, Nepal.    

The Southern Africa Regional Office in Pretoria, South Africa covers 14 countries in Southern Africa.  The region is largely comprised of poor, food insecure nations, and politically unstable and failing states with diverse cultures, languages, topographies, and disaster vulnerabilities.    

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

OBJECTIVE

OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor in its Southern Africa Regional Office in Pretoria, South Africa to ensure that OFDA's objectives for strategic analysis, coordination of disaster response activities, monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded activities, and identification and formulation of disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region are effectively met.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The contractor will actively oversee disaster response activities, and develop and coordinate preparedness, mitigation and training programs to increase the knowledge and capability of Mission Disaster Relief Officers, host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond to and prepare for disasters in the affected region.  As such, t his position requires the individual to do extensive travel throughout the region, approximately one half of his/her time.  In addition, sometimes the travel must occur on very short notice, to countries outside of the Southern Africa Region, or for extended periods.

The Regional Advisor will be responsible for the following:

Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and minimal supervision of the Principal Regional Advisor, the contractor will:
* Travel to the scene of disasters or potential disasters and conduct initial assessments of damage and needs; determine appropriate U.S. Government (USG) relief assistance and emergency interventions in consultation with OFDA/Washington and/or the Principal Regional Advisor;
* Coordinate and maintain close liaison with senior representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassy, and USAID missions to ensure efficient and coordinated disaster response activities;
* Monitor OFDA-funded activities in coordination with the DOS in Washington; 
* Validate OFDA relief supply requests in consultation with OFDA/Washington and coordinate receipt, distribution, tracking, and accounting of supplies;
* Facilitate and coordinate the arrival and departure of  DARTs with the U.S. Mission and, as required, serve on DARTs;
* Liaise, as needed, with U.S. military personnel to ensure a coordinated and efficient disaster response and/or implementation of humanitarian assistance projects;
* Prepare field information and reports, as required by OFDA/Washington.
Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the contractor will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.
Specifically, the contractor will:
* Prepare regular strategic and analytical reporting cables on conditions of current unfolding or developing emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries;
* Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance for OFDA, USAID, local governments, humanitarian organizations, and other donors as appropriate;
* Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA efforts including the review of sector disaster response and plans;
* Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the Southern Africa Regional Office and OFDA/Washington.  Support may include assessment visits, project design and evaluation exercises, and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;
* Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing them;
* Work with senior representatives of local and regional institutions and private and public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:

The Regional Advisor will report directly to the Principal Regional Advisor for Southern Africa.  However, for certain activities, the Regional Advisor will coordinate tasks with the Regional Coordinator in OFDA/Washington.  

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:

Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The Regional Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have latitude to exercise independent judgment.  The Principal Regional Advisor will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation with additional information included in this notice.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) is a law enforcement organization within the United States Department of Justice with unique responsibilities dedicated to reducing violent crime and protecting the public.  In 2002, ATF implemented a new promotion plan for its Grade 14 and 15 special agents.  The plan includes a Promotion Assessment Center (AC) for each grade level.  Bureau managers and senior supervisors (known as subject matter experts or SMEs) facilitated by an outside contractor (Human Resources Research Organization (HumRRO) of Alexandria, VA) design the AC exercises.  HumRRO also trains the assessors, administers and scores the testing, and provides a statistical analysis of the results.  An outside oversight committee, made up of four independent experts highly regarded in the field of industrial or organizational psychology approved the development of the first AC, and the overall promotion plan.  All outside experts who have reviewed ATF?s promotion process and ACs have found them to be ?content valid?.  ATF generally holds one AC a year, alternating between the grade 14 and 15 ACs.  In addition, each year the Bureau rewrites all of the exercises for one of the ACs.  For example, in a year when the Bureau conducts a grade 14 AC, the exercises for the grade 15 AC are being rewritten and vice versa.  The Office of Management oversees the AC Program.  This includes hiring and monitoring the performance of a contractor with expertise in the development and running of ACs to assist in coordinating the design and administration of the Bureau?s ACs, including the coordination of assessor training, AC administrative material that goes to AC participants, reviewing and coordinating AC schedules, and assisting with on-site administration at all ACs.  Timely provision of these services will provide ATF with the support required so that the Bureau can continue to deliver a valid promotion system that meets all governing regulations, industry standards and is in full compliance with a court-approved settlement agreement.  ATF will issue a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) for this requirement with the contractor to perform the following tasks: a) coordinating and assisting in the workshops held to develop AC exercises, including the pilot testing of exercises; b) reviewing and providing feedback on AC exercise content; c) assisting at the meeting with the SME to determine critical competencies; d) reviewing and providing feedback on the statistics generated after each AC, including attending a meeting to discuss the statistics; e) reviewing and providing feedback on the material used in assessor training; f) reviewing and providing feedback on the administrative material that goes to AC participants; g) assisting in the development of AC schedules; h) recommending the location of appropriate facilities to conduct an AC; i)  coordinating and assisting with assessor training; and j) assisting with on-site administration at ACs.  ATF?s AC Director (the COTR) will monitor the contractor?s performance and will determine if tasks are completed on time and appropriately.  The period of performance for this BPA is 36 months from date of award.  The contractor shall propose a firm-fixed price for each of the tasks above for the following periods:  1) Months 1-12; 2) Months 13-24; and 3) Months 25-36.  The contractor may be required to travel to Washington D. C., Alexandria, VA, or elsewhere to complete the required tasks. All travel requires advanced approval by the AC Director or his/her designee.  Travel costs will be reimbursed on a per diem basis, in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations and ATF travel policy, with receipts to be provided by the contractor as required by the Federal Travel Regulations.  The contractor may work in Government-provided space when determined to be necessary by the AC Director.  Work may also on occasion take place off-site at the offices of HUMMRO, other locations, or at the contractor?s location.  The agency will provide the contractor with any needed computer equipment, which may include a government provided laptop, with all necessary software.  Invoices for each completed fixed-price task shall be submitted electronically to the Financial Management Division (FMD) at financebranch@atf.gov, with a copy to the AC Director.  Invoices for authorized travel expenses, with receipts as required by the Federal Travel Regulations and the BPA, shall be submitted upon completion of each trip to FMD, with a copy to the AC Director.  Because of the sensitive and significant nature of the project, the contractor must adhere to the following: a) Physical and operations security procedures, articulated in ATF O 1720.5, Headquarters Security Program, dated September 28, 1995.  A copy will be provided upon request; b) ATF O 7500.2, Automated Information System Security Program, dated July 15, 1997.  A copy will be provided upon request; c) The Privacy Act and implementing regulations dealing with the handling of sensitive personnel and testing information; d) the terms of the ATF Non-Disclosure Agreement; e) returning ATF supplied materials and files created by the contractor at the conclusion of the BPA; and f) completion of background investigation forms.  The contractor must, at a minimum, possess the following qualifications: a) A working knowledge of Federal personnel laws, regulations and policies relating to the promotion of employees; b) Extensive experience in the field of Federal law enforcement, which must include experience in a position at least equivalent to an Assistant Special Agent in Charge (the highest-level position filled under the AC promotion process); c) A working knowledge of ATF mission, policies and programs; and d) Experience in the design, development, and implementation of assessment centers.  Offerors must provide specific examples to demonstrate how they meet each of the required qualifications above.  The following provisions and clauses are incorporated into this notice by reference and no addenda apply: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; FAR 212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.

Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  All potential offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database (www.ccr.gov) prior to award.

Both gate s are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holid ays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial  vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercia l vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee t hat the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater th an 12'-5in clearance) will require a time stamped searched- label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched- labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their veh icle is over 12'-5in in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a -searched- label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any  tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Pro tection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.

Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tie r, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).

The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.

If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge i s denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its s ole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g ., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time fra me for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.

The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advanc e notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.

<DESC>The 325th Contracting Squadron, Tyndall AFB FL intends to award a purchase order to Hydrema US, Inc for the purchase of three (3) Hydrema 910 Mine Area Clearance Equipment (MACE) platforms with associated spares packages, and three (3) sets of Pneumatic Wheels. This award will be issued on a sole-source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-5(b)(7). Any response to this requirement must be received not later than 25 January 2007.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  CONTRACTING AGENCY:	Department of the Air Force
Air Education and Training Command
325th Contracting Squadron (325 CONS)
Tyndall AFB, FL 32403-5526

2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) requests approval to sole source an acquisition for three remote Mine Area Clearance Equipment (MACE) systems for the USAF RED HORSE Squadrons through ACC/A7X.  We anticipate awarding a new firm-fixed price type contract.

3.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  This procurement is for three (3) Hydrema 910 MACE platforms with the associated spares packages, and 3 sets of Pneumatic Wheels.  The MACE is an air transportable, mobile, remote mine flail system used to rapidly clear areas of mines and other small ordnance items that would ordinarily be cleared by manual procedures, putting numerous personnel in harms way.  These life-saving assets are in high demand at contingency airfields worldwide to support the global war on terrorism.  Government and contractor employees of AFRL/MLQF, Robotic Research Group located at Tyndall AFB FL, will perform the modification and integration of the precision robotic controls to the MACE.   The modification will enable the MACE platform to do its mission without individual inside, via remote operated robotics.   The MACE is used by the RED HORSE Civil Engineer teams to clear areas of unexploded ordnance so deploying USAF assets can have the necessary beddown locations.  These MACE assets provide critical capability to the USAF Civil Engineer of the Bare Base deployment packages.
  
4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 ? Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED:  ACC/A7 has directed and obtained funding for three additional prototype systems based on the Hydrema 910 Series 2 platform.  HQ ACC/A7 performed a market survey in 2003 and determined the Hydrema 910 to be the best platform suited for the RED HORSE remote mine area clearance mission in support of the CSAF Global War on Terrorism.  Based on that determination, AFRL/MLQF developed the initial robotic prototype system for the 823d RED HORSE Squadron at Hurlburt Field and has been requested to build the follow-on systems.  Standardization of equipment must be maintained and only original equipment manufacturers (OEM) genuine replacement parts can be used to ensure the standardization and integration of the robotic systems as well as the safety of the operators and maintenance of the systems.  If standardization is not maintained, the gov?t will accept unnecessary risks to include: the inability to operate more than one vehicle in an area during a deployment; increased training and/or familiarization with operating procedures during deployments;  increase in logistics support and spares.  These mine clearance systems and spare parts packages are only manufactured by Hydrema, Inc. and no other vendor can obtain the parts.  

6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  There are no other MACE systems that meet the requirement due to the robotics package being developed for this particular system.  It costs approximately $1M to develop the initial prototype for the Hydrema.  It would cost roughly the same amount to develop a prototype on a new piece of equipment from another manufacturer.  The long term goal is to make the robotics package capable of being installed on more than one type of system.  In the future this will allow us to open up competition.  A synopsis of award will be posted on FedBizOpps to satisfy the requirement of FAR 6.302-1(d)(2).

7.  CONTRACTING OFFICER?S DETERMINATION THAT ANTICIPATED COSTS WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE:  Market research has shown the proposed price is the same per unit price as the original purchase:  Army contract W909MY-04-P-0048, awarded non-competitively (Urgent and Compelling) in 1 Jun 04.  The gov?t will negotiate with Hydrema, Inc and utilize cost/price analysis techniques to ensure that the Air Force is getting pricing that is fair and reasonable. 

8.  MARKET SURVEY:  A market survey was conducted using Internet search engines and no other manufacturer can provide the Hydrema 910 Series 2 platform.  ACC brought in and also visited other flail manufacturers during their initial market research.  Hydrema was contacted in Nov 06 and there are no authorized resellers, they only sell direct from the company. The requirement will be posted on FedBizOpps after approval of the J&A. 

9.  OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  In the Air Force Airborne RED HORSE Engineer Concept of Operations, dated 16 September 2002, the CSAF stated that the Air Force requires an Airborne Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operations Repair Squadron, Engineers (RED HORSE) combat engineer capability to ?Assess, Prepare and Establish? contingency airbases in remote locations through airdrop, air-insertion, or air-delivery.  Per HQ USAF/ILS memorandum dated 10 Jan 2002:  ?It is imperative we accelerate procurement of Bare Base assets.  Request you use whatever contract method deemed necessary for accelerated procurement of Bare Base assets.  Intended goal is to have assets delivered ASAP to the AOR.?  ?The Bare Base program is an Air Force priority, with OSD oversight to ensure the AF Bare Base Systems have the required capability to support Operation ENDURING FREEDOM Crisis Action Planning and the strategy addressed in the Defense Planning Guidance.?  Also, purchase of the required items are instrumental in the Global War on Terrorism. 

10.  INTERESTED SOURCES:  	Hydrema US, Inc.  										
11.  REMOVE OR OVERCOME BARRIERS TO COMPETITION:  AFRL?s robotic system is based on what is about to become an industry standard for all unmanned systems, an SAE standard called the joint architecture for unmanned systems (JAUS).  Based on this standard, other than the differences in mounting hardware, etc, the AFRL remote system could be adapted quite readily to any system.  Any future effort will be posted in the FedBizOpps to continue to generate interest.  AFRL/MLQ will continue to work with ACC/A7X to verify there are no substitutes available.

12.  CONTRACTING OFFICER?S CERTIFICATION:  The contracting officer has affixed her signature to coordination and approval sheet and has thereby certified that the contents of this justification and approval is accurate and complete to the best of her knowledge and belief.

13.  TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  The appropriate management personnel of the requesting organization have certified the support data that forms the basis for this justification to be accurate and complete.

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

?	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

?	If editing is required, update the first submission; don?t create a second invoice submission.

?	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

?	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don?t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

?	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

?	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. ?R? to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

?	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

?	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a month?s worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i)entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
