Responses to this RFI will assist NASA Education in determining the level of interest inparticipation, the perceived feasibility of the concept, the ability to provide funding,and implementation concepts or solutions.  If a decision is made to proceed with theconcept, information provided by the RFI will assist NASA in establishing requirements,resources, and evaluation criteria.There are many factors and options to be considered prior to NASAs decision to proceedwith this educational venture; and this RFI solicits ideas and feedback on thepreliminary concepts.  If NASA decides to proceed with the concept, the next step couldbe the release of a solicitation to attract and select university participants, andidentify scientific and educational objectives.Specific questions to be addressed are listed in Section 5 of this RFI. 2.0	MISSION OBJECTIVE AND GOALThe objective of ASMO is to provide NASA project and systems engineering oversight andcoordinated mentoring to selected university student teams who would design, build,launch, operate, and analyze data for a lunar spacecraft and payload.  NASA would makeavailable controlled access to NASA engineers and other subject matter experts and mayenable access to appropriate NASA facilities.  The university teams would be responsible for (1) direct and detailed project management,(2) design, build, testing, integration, brokering the launch, launch into lunar orbit,and (on-orbit and ground) operation of the ASMO spacecraft, (3) obtaining funding tosupport and manage these activities, and (4) identification, development, and monitoringof educational objectives ( at the elementary/secondary education, higher education, andinformal education levels) and reporting progress toward meeting them.	Under the concept, the NASA/ASMO team would offer access to NASA subject matter expertsthrough coordinated mentoring, facilitation of reviews at key decision points, andprovision of one to two university workshops per year at participating NASA Centers.Please see the ASMO website at http://asmo.arc.nasa.gov       for further information onhow this might work.The European Space Agency (ESA) has initiated a similar project: the European StudentMoon Orbiter (ESMO). Having progressed into mission Phase A in 2006, ESMO is the latestin a series of end-to-end ESA sponsored student flight projects.  Through preliminarydiscussions with NASA Education representatives, ESA representatives have expressedinterest in potential collaboration between the ESMO and AMSO student missions.  However,no formal agreement between NASA and ESA has been yet been established regardingpotential collaboration or coordination of the efforts.3.0	MISSION DESCRIPTION Payload capacity and parameters for the orbit will be determined by the student teamswith guidance of NASA mentors. Possible payloads and lunar science objectives currentlyof interest to NASA include testing and relaying high bandwidth laser and radiocommunications protocols, characterizing the lunar dust environment, lunar gravitymapping, high-definition video, and 3-D imaging.  The final scientific payloads would bedetermined, designed and built by the student teams.  The ASMO craft is conceived to be launched on an Enhanced Expendable Launch Vehicle(EELV) utilizing an Expendable Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) ring.  NASA currently hasno plans to provide a launch vehicle or support for the ASMO launch.ITAR Note: All participants in the ASMO concept must ensure compliance with the U.S.Department of Commerces Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the U.S. Departmentof States International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). For more information pleasesee http://www.pmddtc.state.gov       4.0	MISSION APPROACH4.1 NASA Would Provide	Concept development and Pre-Phase A project functions	Results of the payload design feasibility study 	Request for Information to solicit public input	Lead university team selection	Top-level project and systems engineering oversight throughout the project	Controlled access to NASA mentors and other subject matter experts 	Up to two university workshops per year at participating NASA Centers	Facilitation of design reviews and identification of Key Decision Points	Agency strategic communications including public outreach, education andsolicitations	Roll-up NASA reporting of project progress and accomplishment of educationobjectives, results, and outcomes (elementary/secondary education, higher education, andinformal education)NOTE:  NASA does not foresee providing direct funding to the universities or partners.4.2 University Teams Would Provide	Launch Opportunity including launch vehicle and integration, and insurance	Project Management to include project documentation, documentation control,configuration control, procurement, finance, fundraising, and project communication	Systems Engineering	Mission Analysis to include simulations and orbital dynamics	Quality Assurance to include reliability, safety and mission assurance, andfailure modes effects and analysis	Spacecraft to include thermal subsystem, structures subsystem, electricalsubsystem, power subsystem, attitude and orbit control subsystem, mechanisms/deployablesubsystem, communications subsystems, registration and ownership of the ASMO spacecraft,including negotiation for orbital position	Mission operations and supporting mission-unique hardware and ground activities	Assembly, Integration and Testing to include spacecraft testing, facilities, andspacecraft integration	Payload and Science Experiments including scientific data collection, transfer,analysis, and reporting	Ground Segment to include electrical ground support equipment (GSE) andmechanical GSE 	IT Infrastructure	Flight Software including data collection and data transfer	Responsive reporting of education objectives, results, and outcomes(elementary/secondary education, higher education, and informal education)	Other efforts required for successful completion of the ASMO mission4.3 University Team StructureUnder the current concept, a single Level 1 university team and three Level 2 universityteams would be selected by NASA to perform the following leadership roles:	Project Lead (Level-1)	Business Lead (Level-2)	Spacecraft/Systems Engineering Lead (Level-2)	Science/Payloads Lead (Level-2)In addition, NASA will select an estimated 30 additional Level 3 student teams to conductall aspects of the design, development, systems engineering and integration, testing, andoperations of the spacecraft and the payload subsystems. The students will be responsiblefor the development and execution of comprehensive project and business managementfunctions.Various alternative approaches have been considered for the ASMO project organization andadministration.  For example, proposals could be obtained from university teams biddingfor participation in specific sub-systems resulting in the selection of a prime and asub-prime university team for each sub-system.	In this approach NASA would designate asingle university-based project manager, responsible for daily operations and ensuringexecution of major milestones, deliverables, and project documentation.  Another approachwould be for universities to build alliances and organize themselves into fully orsemi-comprehensive teams prior to developing their proposals and thus submit pre-packagedteam proposals detailing their unique approach to covering all required subsystems andproject functions across university lines.  These alternate approaches are not intended to suggest expectations or requirements onproject management structure.  Comments on alternative approaches to the ASMO projectstructure and management approach should be addressed in response to this RFI.	4.4 Funding Concept The university project participants would be responsible for costs and financialmanagement for designing, building, testing, and integration of payloads and subsystemsfor the ASMO spacecraft as well as financial support for the launch, insurance, missionoperations, and data collection and analysis.  The university participants would also beresponsible for performing detailed cost estimating and developing comprehensive businessand education plans including a realistic budget, a financial control system, andeducation objectives. NASA would support internal Agency costs associated with the services and activitiesdescribed in section 4.1 above.  NASAs role in the final system integration and testing using NASAs facilities has notbeen determined.  4.5 Design Feasibility Study of an ASMO-like SpacecraftIn December 2006, a NASA Collaborative Modeling for Parametric Assessment of SpaceSystems (COMPASS) team performed a design feasibility study of the ASMO spacecraftconcept.  The preliminary design concept of a spacecraft, generated during the course ofthis study, was intended purely to determine the feasibility of developing a spacecraftand payload under certain technical and cost constraints, and was not intended toinfluence or limit design thinking by the university teams.  The COMPASS Study is astarting point from which the ASMO students could then perform their own design conceptand feasibility studies.  The American Student Moon Orbiter (ASMO) COMPASS FeasibilityStudy is available on the ASMO website at:http://asmo.arc.nasa.gov/files/asmo/ASMO_Docs7/RFI_Documents/COMPASS_Study.pdf	     5.0	RESPONDING TO THIS RFI5.1 Content of RFI Response This is a Request for Information, not a Request for Proposals (RFP), and it does notimply that a solicitation will be forthcoming.

<DESC>Gatton Creek Trail Bridge is a damaged single span glu-lam girder (2 girder bridge) trail bridge approximately 70 feet long with 3 foot wide glu-lam deck.
 
The Gatton Creek Trail Bridge was damaged during a winter storm event by falling trees. One glu-lam girder, one steel diaphragm and the handrail system was damaged during the storm.   The Olympic National Forest intends to award a contract to repair the bridge via the disassembly of the bridge and installation of REPLACEMENT PARTS.

The Olympic National Forest has ordered REPLACEMENT PARTS including: one new glu-lam girder, new decking panels and running boards, a completely new railing system and all new associated hardware (& nails).  All of the above shall be utilized in the repair of the bridge.  The contractor shall field cut, drill, chemically treat (hand treat) and assemble the new handrail system.  Roofing asphalt shall be applied per the top the glulams before installing the new decking panels and running boards.  Roofing asphalt and Copper Naphthenate treatment shall be supplied by the contractor. 

The majority of the steel hardware on Gatton Creek Trail Bridge shall be reused except where clearly damaged or as noted in the drawings.  A REPLACEMENT PARTS list shall be included in the final solicitation along with original drawings and shop drawings.  The REPLACEMENT PARTS shall be available during the first week the performance period (Early September) and the delivery and unloading shall be performed by the contractor in Quinault, Washington at a designated location at the Forest Service Quinault Sewage Treatment Plant .  Disassembly of the majority of the existing bridge is highly likely to successfully install the REPLACEMENT PARTS in the repair of the bridge.

The hired contractor shall be responsible for the mobilizing all REPLACEMENT PARTS, construction materials, construction equipment and other materials to the construction site along the Gatton Creek Trail.  Access to the site is limited due to blow down (trees) in the vicinity.  The Forest anticipates the use of a helicopter by the contractor to complete this project.  Helicopter use and shall be permitted from Sept 15th to Sept 30th . A helicopter landing area will not be provided in this contract.

Temporary shoring (and/or approved cable supports) may be necessary to complete the project safely, to protect resources and to prevent damage of government property.  Work in and around Gatton Creek must meet the requirements of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Forest Service and WA State Dept of Fish and Wildlife to be included in the solicitation.

All removed materials not suitable to future bridge maintenance shall become the property of the contractor and shall be disposed of properly (per Washington State law).

There is no vehicle access to the bridge site and a site visit (approx 0.5 mile hike) is recommended to all interested in the project.  This solicitation will be issued under FAR Part 12 for a commercial service. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government.  In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.  Lack of registration in the CCR on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award. 

Contract award will be to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the best value to the government. The government estimated value is between $25,000 and  $75,000.  

The Gatton Creek Bridge is located in Washington on the Olympic National Forest on the Pacific Ranger District in Grays Harbor County and further located in T. 23N., R. 9 W., Section 21.  From Hoquiam, WA travel north on Hwy 101 for 39 miles CR 9340. (South Shore Road) Travel for 2.8 miles to the Gatton Creek Trailhead.  The site may be accessed by walking up the Gatton Creek Trail for 0.5 miles.  Access to the bridge site from the North is limiting due to blow down in the trail.

<CONTACT>Donald E Collie, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-0992, Fax 301-480-4675, Email dcollie@niaid.nih.gov
<DESC>Introduction: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (NIAID/DAIT) has a requirement to identify, characterize, and develop new medical countermeasures against radiological or nuclear attacks. 

Description: NIAID/DAIT plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the Radiation Effects Research Foundation of Japan. If the need arises, an Offeror would conduct research on radiation-induced immune system aging (immunosenescence) and other late effects of radiation to determine the effects of radiation and aging on the immune and other organ systems and the contribution of such effects to disease development in persons exposed to an atomic bomb explosion.  The Offeror would conduct research to understand the mechanisms of radiation and aging and how these factors impact immune aging, to determine the relationship between immune dysfunction and a persistent inflammatory state, and the resulting diseases and infections that may occur with immunosenescence in those who survived an atomic bomb explosion. The Offeror would use specimens obtained from atomic bomb survivors and perform correlative basic science studies in animal models to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of radiation-induced immunosenescence.  

The Offeror, if awarded, would be required to analyze the effects of ionizing radiation exposure and aging on the hematopoietic stem cells; analyze the effects of ionizing radiation on dendritic cells and their precursors; analyze the effects of ionizing radiation exposure and aging on vaccination responses and investigate methods to augment a robust immune response; develop a comprehensive scoring system for human immune competence as it relates to age and ionizing radiation.

Offeror would be required, for example, to demonstrate and document the following:

1. Demonstrated history of tracking for decades the long-term health status of tens of thousands of individuals including men and women from all age groups who were exposed to nuclear weapon-associated ionizing radiation of varying degrees.
2. Demonstrated history of conducting prospective and retrospective clinical and basic research studies in atomic-bomb survivors.
3. Access to survivors, databases, and tissue samples (e.g., blood) of atomic-bomb survivors.
4. Demonstrated history of conducting research in atomic-bomb survivors and the impact radiation on the immune system in this population.
5. Personnel/Management: adequacy, appropriateness and relevance of expertise, experience, qualifications, and availability of the key professional and technical staff with a project of similar size, scope, and complexity.  

It is anticipated that cost reimbursement, completion type contract shall be awarded to a single contractor for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about July 15, 2009, pending the availability of funds and receipt of technically acceptable proposals from the contractor. The estimated FTEs would be approximately 9.2, inclusive of work subcontracted to institutions within the United States. In addition, the Offeror will provide a proposal to accomplish the above requirements for the 5 year period of planned funding. If desired, the Offeror will at the time of proposal incorporate the Option to develop additional projects in the field of radiation-induced immunosenescence and/or other late effects of radiation in atomic bomb survivors. Since research is an evolving process, additional funding for FTEs may be required pending the need and the availability of funding.

The proposal would be evaluated according to the following criteria: (1) Technical Plan/Approach, (2) Scientific and Technical Personnel, (3) Facilities, Equipment, and other Resources, and (4) Project Management.

The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about August 25, 2008, with an anticipated offer due date on or about January 25, 2009. The firm date of receipt of offers will be stated in the RFP. This notice does not commit the Government to award the contract. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

Description: As a part of its continuing biodefense effort, NIAID announces a B Cell Epitope Discovery and Mechanisms of Antibody Protection Program.  The goal of this program is to identify novel B cell epitopes and elucidate novel mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection or pathogenesis that are important in humoral immunity in humans to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and potential agents of bioterrorism and their toxins (listed as NIAID Emerging and Re-Emerging Diseases and NIAID Category A, B, and C Priority Pathogens at http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/-emerging/list.htm).  

Offerors must propose a research program that includes: discovery of linear or conformational B cell epitopes; evaluation of all newly discovered epitopes for their functionality in vitro and in vivo in appropriate animal models and/or with human samples; and studies to identify the mechanisms of protection or pathogenesis elicited by antibodies associated with epitopes discovered under this program.  Clinical trials will not be supported under this solicitation.  Appropriate animal models may be used; however, the use of human samples is strongly encouraged. All epitope information and computation tools developed under the contract shall be submitted to the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (www.ImmuneEpitope.org) to facilitate access and use of these data and tools by the broader research community.  Offerors may also propose novel methods, algorithms, or models for the discovery and validation of B cell epitopes and mechanisms of antibody protection/pathogenesis.

It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a five (5) year period of performance beginning on or about August 17, 2009.    

The NIAID estimates that the average annual total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) per contract is $1 million.  However, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s).  The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  The period of performance proposed by an Offeror should not exceed five (5) years.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.   This BAA will be available electronically on/about July 15, 2008, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (RFP-BAA-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-08-32) entitled Large Scale T Cell Epitope Discovery under full and open competitive procedures.
Description: As a part of its continuing biodefense effort, NIAID announces a Large Scale T Cell Epitope Discovery Program.  The goal of the program is to identify immune epitopes that are important in protection of humans from NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens and emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (listed at http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/emerging/list.htm).  This solicitation focuses on the identification and validation of immunodominant and subdominant T cell epitopes, which bind MHC class I, MHC class II, or non-classical MHC/HLA molecules (e.g., HLA-E, HLA-F, HLA-G, H-2M, H-2Q, H-2T, CD1).  

Offerors must propose a research program that includes: epitope identification; epitope validation; and epitope submission to the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) (www.ImmuneEpitope.org).

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The Center for Research for Mothers and Children, Obstetric and Pediatric Pharmacology Branch, within the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) and HHSAR 306.302-1 (a) (2) (ii), a modification to its current contract with Premier Research Group, Philadelphia, PA, entitled Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA)  Data Coordinating Center.  This six to eight month contract extension is necessary in order to avoid a lapse in contract performance and continue services in its operations of the Data Coordinating Center. This modification will allow Premier Research Group to continue uninterrupted services in supporting ongoing BPCA pediatric clinical trials until a new competitive contract can be awarded and the services transitioned.  

This modification is to continue services until approximately March 31, 2009 or until this new competitive contract can be awarded. Also, it may be necessary to continue data coordinating support and analysis of the data of some ongoing clinical trials that are near completion beyond March 31, 2009, with Premier Research Group. This is because a few trials that are near completion may be at a critical juncture as monitoring data, tracking study progress, formatting the data for FDA, and providing study drugs (including placebos) could pose specific risks to the study, data and/or patients, if a new Contractor were brought in before completion or until a smooth transition could be effected.  A contract extension will allow NICHD to closely supervise the continued activities of the Data Coordinating Center, including monitoring patient records, analyzing collected data, submitting data and final study reports to the FDA, and closing out specific study phases in an orderly fashion. This additional time will allow for a transition to the selected offeror under the new competitive procurement. 

It is critical that the services provided by the Data Coordinating Center not be interrupted as the data coordinating center is integral to the success of the pediatric clinical trials that it supports and these consist of multiple pediatric clinical trials, which to-date, include activities that support approximately fifteen ongoing clinical studies, involving approximately 110  Pediatric Off-Patent Drug Study (PODS) clinical study site centers, with as many as 1400 children, (many in intensive care settings). A primary responsibility of the Data Coordinating Center is to ensure that pediatric clinical trials are performed and documented according to the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards as described by FDA and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) GCP Guidelines. The Contractor regularly gathers, monitors, and formats the study data generated from each POD Center clinical study site and is responsible for submitting the data to FDA for regulatory approval and label modification. A break in the services of the data coordinating center would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the needs of these ongoing clinical pediatric trials. 

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting information (5 page limit) required in Numbered Note 22 within 45 days of publication of this synopsis. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Deliveries should be sent to:

<DESC>USAID/Afghanistan intends to competitively award a performance-based five year contract (base plus option) for the Alternative Development Program (ADP) in Afghanistan.  The purpose of the project is to increase licit and commercially viable agricultural-based alternatives for rural Afghans with the goal of significantly reducing and ultimately eradicating poppy production in the more insecure and unstable southern provinces of Afghanistan (currently the 6 provinces of Farah, Nimruz, Helmand, Kandahar, Uruzgan, and Zabul). 

The contract will be two-fold: 1) outcomes based; and 2) payment for results.  Offerors will compete with proposed solutions that meet the requirements of the contract and are tailored to an optimal technical / business approach.  The goal is to contribute to the creation of full and part-time and year-round and seasonal jobs, increased sales, strengthened associations, increased exports and improved access to services to promote licit economic growth and positive alternatives to the illicit economy for farmers and non-farmers alike.  The Offerors should consider revenue generation and cost recovery, anti-corruption, gender, Afghanization (local project ownership) and local governance as important cross-cutting issues that must be included in all programmatic elements.  

The Offerors are expected to provide a Performance Work Statement (PWS), performance metrics and measurement plan, Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP), and incentives (monetary or otherwise) as part of the proposal package.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This notice is posted IAW FAR 5.203 and 5.204.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District, intends to solicit and award one firm fixed priced contract for Environmental Remediation Services located at Cape Canaveral Air Station, FL, in the support of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). This action will be initiated under NAICS Code 562910 with a size standard of 500 employees.   The subject solicitation will be set-aside for qualified small business concerns IAW FAR 19.502-2. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on or about 16 July 2008 2008.  <BR><BR>SCOPE:  <BR><BR>The following is a summary of the proposed scope of services.  The actual scope of services will be released with the solicitation on or about 16 July 2008.  <BR><BR>Summary:<BR>The following is a brief summary of the proposed CCAFS Industrial Area Regional Treatment Basin planned to be constructed as a Regional Stormwater Improvement Project in the Industrial Area of CCAFS. The purpose/scope of the work plan, design, and stormwater treatment system is to: <BR>1. Manage (capture, route and treat) stormwater runoff from the western portion of the CCAFS Industrial Area (Regionalized Stormwater Basin permitted by SJRWMD), and <BR>2. Prevent (capture and treat) groundwater contaminated with chlorinated solvents (managed by the FDEP) in the Industrial Area of CCAFS from discharging to the Banana River Lagoon located along the western edge of the installation.   <BR><BR>The Banana River Lagoon has been designated an Outstanding Florida Water, a Federal Manatee Sanctuary, and is part of the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge.  Therefore, it is critical to prevent contamination from discharging into the Banana River Lagoon through a combination of stormwater management and groundwater capture and treatment.   <BR><BR>Project Approach:<BR>The current design is for the construction of a stormwater retention/treatment basin system on the west side of the CCAFS Industrial Area to capture stormwater runoff from the western portion of the CCAFS Industrial Area and groundwater/surface waters impacted (or potentially impacted) by chlorinated solvent contamination emanating from industrial area groundwater plumes.  It has been determined that contaminated groundwater can upwell into surface water swales, canals, and ditches that eventually discharge into the Banana River Lagoon. <BR>In addition to the retention/treatment basin, changes to the stormwater conveyance systems (ditches, swales, canals, etc.) in the CCAFS Industrial Area will be required to divert stormwater into the basin area. Aeration, volatilization, and phytoremediation shall be the primary methods used to remove volatile organic compounds from the basin water prior to discharge to the Banana River Lagoon. <BR><BR>The proposed improvement plan establishes two wet detention stormwater management areas. The wet detention areas consist of newly constructed lake areas connected by new conveyance swales, piping and control structure. Following the Primary system east of Scrub Jay Road, the overflow is piped to another wet detention system west of Scrub Jay Road for additional treatment.  The wet detention system discharges by control structure to a bubble-up system into a wetland area south of the 1798 canal.<BR><BR>Groundwater and surface water impacted with VOC will be captured and treated through a variety of treatment processing including: <BR>1. Air stripping/aeration/agitation treatment via a SolarBee (or equivalent) treatment unit in the main basin east of Scrub Jay Road <BR>2. Air stripping/aeration/agitation treatment via a solar powered aeration system in the secondary basin west of Scrub Jay Road <BR>3. Phytoremediation via wetland plant species uptake installed throughout the primary and secondary basin system <BR>4. Photoionization/Volatilization via sunlight surface exposure throughout the primary and secondary treatment basin systems <BR>5. Evapotranspiration via atmospheric conditions.  Evapotranspiration is considered to be one of the most significant influences in the pond system based on Floridas climatic conditions.  This process will be a significant factor in the drawdown of the pond surface water elevations to help ensure maximum groundwater plume capture. <BR>6. Air Stripping/treatment via agitation of surface water flow across various surface water features and structures throughout the basin treatment systems <BR><BR>The 1798 canal bubbler/aerator system will need to be removed and partially abandoned as part of the secondary basin construction efforts. The canal bubbler sparge legs will be removed and salvaged for replacement parts for other operation canal bubbler systems at CCAFS.  The blower unit and applicable infrastructure will be removed and temporarily stored or left in place (if unimpacted by construction activities) for future use as necessary.  If the proposed basin treatment system is unable to effectively remove VOC contaminants, the blower system can be retrofitted to provide more significant air stripping treatment in the secondary basin prior to discharge to the wetland system.  <BR><BR><BR>Basin Construction Activities:<BR>The primary construction activities to be conducted as part of the basin treatment system construction generally include: <BR>1. Remove and replace existing sanitary sewer line crossing (east/west) the primary basin foot print. The existing gravity feed sewer line will be replaced with a ductile iron pipe encased in a HDPE sleeve to allow double containment under the stormwater basin while allowing future access for maintenance as needed.<BR>2. Establishment of a truck haul route along Scrub Jay Road and the construction of a temporary bridge crossing over the FT-17 canal to emplace basin spoils in the permitted Titan Soil Staging Area.  Soil samples were collected and analyzed from various locations and depths within the basin footprint to determine re-use options.  All soil sample results were non-detect or below FDEP SCTLs and/or CCAFS background screening criteria.  Therefore, the soil meets the CCAFS clean fill criteria and will be staged at the Titan Soil Staging Area for future use as clean fill. <BR>3.

<DESC>Under the Authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Quantico, VA intends to award a sole source contract to Allen-Vanguard, 921 Barton Street, Stoney Creek, Ontario, Canada L8E 5P5; for the refurbishing and maintaining of Mobility Denial System MDS Equipment that were used during the MDS developmental Test period.  There are currently two HMMWV-mounted Vehicle-Transportable systems and two back-pack or man-portable systems that are being held at the manufacturer's site.  The systems still function properly, but, as a result of the various humidity, salt fog, and extreme temperature  and shock test, have significant amounts of rust and other corrosion on them and within the nozzle caviities that would jeopardize long-term storage.  Once the systems are refurbished they shall be transported from the Manufacturer's site to their permanent storage location, which shall be at Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany Georgia.  The dispensing systems are mdade up of various pieces (bolts, hoses, clamps, straps, etc.) that could be replaced by numerous sources.  However, both the vehicle systems and the backpack systems have one-of-a-ind water and powder reservoirs, pressure regulators, and mixing nozzles that require special piece parts and calibration to ensure the anti-traction powder and water mix properly.  Although other companies could clean and replace the bolts, hoses, and fastening straps, no other contractor currently has the expertise to reassemble, calibrate, and test the refurbished articles to ensure they are operationally ready for long-term storage and future use.  Allen-Vanguard is considered to be the only source that can responsibly refurbish the four remaining MDS systems - to include the recalibration of the unique Allen-Vanguard fabricated regulators and nozzles.  This is not a formal solicitation; furthermore, this synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.

Introduction and Scope of WorkThe President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health concluded that to improve care for individuals with mental illness, health care systems need to be recovery-oriented, accessible and consistent with evidence-based practices. In response to the commission's report, the Under Secretary for Health of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) charged a task force to review the Commission's recommendations and determine the relevance to the veteran population. After reviewing the report and evaluating the efficacy for a veteran population, the task force developed recommendations which were later the basis for the VA Mental Health Strategic Plan (2004):   The cornerstone of the strategic plan has been the transforming of VHA mental health care to a system that is person centered; one in which each medical center is responsible for  implementing a full-continuum of recovery oriented services that facilitate a journey of healing for a person with a mental health condition in order to live a meaningful life while striving towards personal goals.We would like to identify an experienced professional consulting group to assist us in transforming the VISN 3 mental health service delivery system from one which is based on a medical model of care to one that is patient centered and recovery oriented.  VISN 3 began this transformation approximately 18 months ago and has been one of the national leaders in these efforts.   However, to move our efforts to the next level we are seeking outside expertise particularly focused on culture transformation and partnering with consumers. Although this initiative may seem to have a narrow objective, it in fact will require a significant shift in our current mental health service delivery paradigm which will impact the dynamics of the patient/provider interaction throughout our mental health service delivery system as well as the overall culture in which we provide care.  2.	RequirementsThis consulting position requires an agency or group that has had previous success with recovery transformation in a hospital setting.  The agency should be willing to provide a proposal for consideration that includes referrals from previous projects and identify exactly what were the accomplishments, what were the challenges and what strategies were employed to meet these challenges; a detailed outline of the proposed consulting effort; all educational tools to be used; vitas from all participating personnel with the expectation that the team must be lead by a mental health professional and all team members should have previous experience in mental health settings and educating consumers as well as providers on recovery transformation. The successful bidder must be willing to travel to VISN 3. Outcome: By the end of this 1 year to 18 months consultation, VA NY/NJ Health Care System (VISN 3) will receive the following products:"	A proposal that includes a detailed plan for accomplishing recovery transformation in VISN 3 including reasonable goals and milestones. "	5 - 7 teams of trained recovery transformation change agents (Recovery Coordinators, veterans, and providers) that can enhance change momentum, broaden transformation leadership, and initiate and facilitate site-specific recovery transformation projects and facilitate educational events at each VA site. "	A minimum of 500 stakeholders VISN wide (to include both staff and veterans) trained in veteran centered partnering and planning in individual provider practice."	Educational resources that have been adapted (through training) to the local context of the NY/NJ VA system "	A foundation for a paradigm shift toward partnering with veterans and other stakeholders through mutual learning, planning and the identification of opportunities to strengthen service delivery. "	A plan for ongoing consultation and follow-up to assess the needs, questions and concerns of the Local Recovery Coordinators. We anticipate this consultation will last 1 year to 18 months.  At the onset of the contract VISN 3 mental health leadership will identify the outcome milestones with the consultant agency. The majority of the work will be within VISN 3 and will require travel to each facility.  Any off campus trainings will be at the discretion of VISN 3 leadership.  Off campus training accommodations for VA staff will be provided by VISN 3.  All consulting will be done between the hours of 8am and 4:30.  Departure from this will be at the discretion of VISN 3 leadership.  The consultant group will only work with veterans during these hours, with VA staff present, and only in their role as consumer consultants to the recovery transformation process. No individual patient health care information will be solicited. The consultant group will be responsible for providing all educational material directly related to the consultation.  VISN 3 will provide training settings and all audio visual equipment.  a)	Facility DataContracted agency will not have access to patient data or CPRS.b)	Place of PerformanceTraining will take place at each VISN medical center, and it is anticipated that initial Local Recovery Coordinator training will be at an off site location to be determined by VISN 3 mental health leadership, but within reasonable accessibility to the VISN 3 staff and contracted agency. c)	Exchange of DataThere will be no exchange of patient data.d)	BillingBilling will be completed by the VA.  Please see section" 2.1 Contract Administration Data", " 3. Invoices for further details regarding invoice submission.e)	PaymentsInvoices will be paid 30 days arrears after receipt of certified invoice.  f)	Penalty for non-PerformanceFailure to complete outcomes as stipulated by above, and milestones as determined by at onset of contract will result in non-payment.  To assure there are no misperceptions about progress, a VISN 3 mental health recovery transformation leadership team will meet via phone on a monthly basis to discuss consultation progress. Final determination will be made by VISN 3 mental health leadership.    g)	Reimbursement MethodReimbursement will be the agreed upon consulting fee x logged hours x per diem x travel cost.

5.	Scope and Effectiveness: The DPCIT performs a broad range of tasks related to a complex foreign assistance program in Mexico. NAS programs have a significant impact on embassy operations including those of other USG agencies.

6.	Personal Contacts: The DPCIT will work closely with NAS personnel, the Embassys Management Section, other USG LEA agencies within the Mission, contractors implementing NAS projects and GOM counterparts.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b) to CoCreate Software, Inc. of Fort Collins, CO 80525-5735. This acquisition is for an engineering database upgrade at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). Presently, two NCNR engineering groups utilize different methods for managing data to support their respective missions.  The existing system used by the NCNR Reactor Engineering Group consists of a shared network drive composed of a hierarchal structure of folders containing 2-D engineering drawings, Engineering Change Notices (ECNs), Microsoft Office documents, images and Adobe Portable Document Format (pdfs) files. Search and retrieval capability is provided through a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. This database consists of over 4,100 drawings (some are AutoCad and AutoDesk Inventor files), over 500 ECNs, several hundred Microsoft Word documents including the National Bureau of Standards Reactor (NBSR) Engineering Manual, and over 2,500 photographs of NBSR equipment. The NCNR Instrument Engineering Group operates a central server based relational database system that contains over 80,000 models and drawings of the NCNR facility and associated instruments.  A Microsoft SQL server database is used in conjunction with CoCreate ModelManager software to store and retrieve information.  The purpose of this procurement is to upgrade the existing CoCreate ModelManager database by incorporating all of the files contained in the shared network drive of NCNR Reactor Engineering Group and provide easy and intuitive access to these files by all users (e.g., using attribute searches).

The upgraded database will allow users to better manage the data from both groups, bringing everything under the CoCreate ModelManager database.  This procurement will require the contractor to upgrade and modify an existing NCNR CoCreate ModelManager database to support new document types, non-CoCreate applications and users that are novices or neophytes.  CoCreate Software, Inc., has developed the database system to be upgraded.  To preserve the integrity of the proprietary ModelManager software and maintain any warranty and service agreements, NIST intends to contract with CoCreate Software, Inc. for this upgrade.  CoCreate has developed proprietary tools in order to complete database upgrades of this type and has gained intimate knowledge of the current NCNR database from support they have provided. 

This notice of intent is not a solicitation.  Interested parties may identify their interest; however, they must clearly and unambiguously demonstrate their ability to perform the requirement in writing, no later than the response date in order to be considered. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures may be used by the Government.  

Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Jill Johnson at jill.johnson@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.

This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; however, companies that believe they can provide a solution that meets NISTs requirments provide a written response to this notice and provide clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate that capability. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competition.

Request For Information Title:  Public Reading Room Photocopier/Printing Services
Release Date:  July 1, 2008 Eastern Standard Time (EDT)
Response Due Date:  August 15, 2008 Eastern Standard Time (EDT)
Submit responses to:  phuongu@mail.nih.gov

NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) 

Issuing Institute or Center: NATIONAL  LIBRARY OF MEDICINE (NLM)

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), its Institutes or Centers.  The purpose of this RFI is to help the NIH understand market availability, technical characteristics, and functionality of photocopier and printing products capable of satisfying the technical, functional, and/or operational characteristics described in this RFI.  NIH will use this market research information in its evaluation of potential solutions for planning a Request For Proposal for photocopier and printing solutions for the main Reading Room at the National Library of Medicine.

NIH welcomes comments from all interested parties on each or all of the questions contained in this RFI.  NIH does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NIHs use of such information.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the NIH's evaluation of the information received.  

Description of Objective
NIH seeks information on how to set up and maintain a vending card based photocopier and printing service for public users in the main Reading Room of the National Library of Medicine (NLM).

Description of Environment
NLMs main Reading Room serves the research needs of the general public.  NLM, which is the largest medical library in the world, is located on NIHs secure campus in Bethesda, MD.  Visitors to the Library may not remove materials from the main Reading Room.  Thus, all hard copy resources must be photocopied onsite.  Additionally, the Library subscribes to many electronic resources, which users may either print or download to their own electronic storage media.  On average, the public make approximately 146,000 copies or prints each month in the main Reading Room.  Currently, the Library provides copying and printing services through a multi-year government contract.  The Librarys current contractor provides onsite staff, all equipment, maintenance, and a card vending system which interfaces with the Librarys circulation system.  Additionally, the contractor operates a patron ID card registration system on the behalf of NLM, and the supplies for this system are paid for by the contractor.  The contractor has also established a Pharos printing solution for the Library.  The contractor is paid through the receipts generated by onsite copying and printing customers.  Currently, the Library is investigating alternatives to provide these same services, possibly with a reduced presence of onsite staff, moving away from stand alone copiers and printers to multifunctional devices  which can serve as both copiers and printers --while still utilizing Pharos and a similar card vending system.  

Description of Project
NLM seeks information on all possible configurations of photocopying and printing solutions within the following criteria:  The information gathered through this market research, will provide NLM with important decision support information.  
	Compatibility with the Librarys current patron ID card  which serves as a debit card for the current vending system, as well as carrying a barcode patrons need to authenticate with the Librarys circulation module and Pharos printing system.
	Compatibility with and possible improvement upon the Librarys current Pharos print management system  which currently utilizes several public workstations as Pharos release stations and dedicated printers.  NLM seeks to stream line its current printing set-up by utilizing Pharos or Pharos-compatible technology to allow patrons to print jobs directly at integrated multifunctional devices which are also used for photocopying.
	Card vending equipment that is compatible with NLMs current patron ID card.
	Appropriateness of equipment  NLM seeks a recommendation for integrated multifunctional devices based on a variety of factors including:  first copy time, copying speed, printing features offering both PCL and PostScript, two separate output areas, compatibility with Pharos Uniprint software, ability to scan jobs and cost.  Book-friendly machines are of special interest to this project.  NLM is not interested in office  oriented finishing options such as duplexing, stapling, booklet making, etc.  Additionally, one color multifunctional will be required for this project.  The project also needs to provide users with a solution to copy microfilm.  
	Flexibility  the photocopying and printing solution should enable NLM to respond to the changing needs of the main Reading Room  specifically as it is difficult to predict the exact volumes of copies that patrons will make from year to year.  However, it is an accepted fact that hard copy photocopying and printing is decreasing in favor of downloading.  
	Fit with existing NIH standards, technologies, and systems   any known interoperability issues a potential standard may have with existing technology standards.
	Cost and efficiency  NLM seeks a copying and printing solution that will enable it to provide a page per copy cost that is a good value to patrons, and which is the result of the most efficient configuration of equipment, supplies, maintenance and availability of customer service staff.  The Library is also interested in project proposals that utilize remote equipment maintenance monitoring, in conjunction with an onsite customer service presence to assist patrons with equipment and vending issues.  Creative combinations of remote and onsite staffing would be of particular interest to the project.  
	Usability and Accessibility  the photocopying and printing solution should enable NLM to deliver an excellent customer service experience to main Reading Room patrons.

It is important to reiterate that this RFI is not intended to gather information needed to address each of the decision criteria above.  Received data will be combined with information gathered through other research and analysis methodologies to support NIHs overall evaluation.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), located in Boqueron, PR., intends to issue a fixed price purchase order for the dissemination of information on the status of goliath and Nassau grouper and red hind in Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands. Workshops for restaurant owners and operators to discuss the importance of purchasing fish that comply with fisheries regulations in order to protect commercial species will be completed as part of this project. The educational materials created for restaurants in FY07 will be disseminated during these workshops. Interactions with commercial fishers in USVI, perhaps during the license renewal period in July 2009, and with commercial fishers in Puerto Rico in cooperation with either the CFMC or the PR Department of Agriculture Fisheries Development Program will also be completed. The project will also examine how coastal development affects the juvenile habitat of groupers and how declines in nursery habitat may contribute to declines in their stocks based on data obtained during the FY07 portion of this work. This work will support local efforts to increase public awareness and reduce the impacts of overfishing, which are focal areas of the Coral Reef Task Force, as well as the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Local Action Strategies. This project is being initiated as part of the Southeast Regional Office's work under the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP). This project is also being initiated as a component of NOAA Fisheries' efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998 through Executive Order #13089. The Executive Order, identified as Coral Reef Protection, seeks to "preserve and protect the biodiversity, health, heritage, and social and economic value of U.S. coral reef ecosystems and marine environment."
<p><br />In order to meet the objective of this work assignment, the contractor shall complete the work in two distinct tasks: completion of a workshop series and compilation of information on declines in nursery habitats and species' stocks. Short -term results will consist of the educating of stakeholders in the tourism industry regarding the importance of grouper conservation. Long-term results will consist of improved compliance with regulations protecting the species and enhancement of species' stocks. If no qualified responses are received, the Government intends to contract with the MRAG Americas, Inc. MRAG, specifically Dr. Sarah Frias-Torres, has been Co-Principal Investigator (PI) on research projects related to studies of red hind and goliath and Nassau grouper, including in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and assisted in the writing of the internal NOAA CRCP proposal through which this work assignment was funded. MRAG specializes in work related to fisheries management, investigations, and education, including designing, planning, and completing workshops with fishers and other stakeholders for entities such as NOAA Fisheries and the Caribbean Fishery Management Council. Therefore, MRAG has the resources and data on the status of Nassau and goliath grouper and red hind necessary to complete the work in a timely manner. Dr. Frias-Torres of MRAG is the person in possession of the data to be presented to stakeholders in completion of this work assignment. Dr. Frias-Torres and MRAG have the ability to produce bilingual workshop materials and complete all aspects of workshop planning and implementation such that NOAA Fisheries needs only to attend the workshops as a participant. MRAG as an intermediary is the only known mechanism available to NOAA Fisheries to accomplish this project. MRAG Americas, Inc. is a small, independent consulting firm dedicated to promoting sustainable use of aquatic resources. The company has a long history and experience conducting marine conservation, outreach, and resource management in the Caribbean region, in addition to experience in the development of educational and bilingual materials. The company has developed and produced materials such as project reports, newsletters, announcements, posters, web pages, brochures, training courses, workshops, and manuals. The company has completed several projects for NOAA and NOAA Fisheries.<br />The anticipated performance period is date of award through September 30, 2009. To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide service. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for which you have furnished this service previously. Information should provide sufficient detail that demonstrates the firm's knowledge and ability to perform the requirement. Only affirmative responses to this notice will be evaluated to the extent necessary for the Government to determine whether it is feasible to conduct a competitive acquisition considering demonstrated knowledge and experience. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required services as stated herein. This notice is for service for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties must respond within (10) days after publication of this notice. If no affirmative responses are received, the government intends to issue a purchase order to the MRAG Americas, Inc. Faxed responses can be sent to 816-274-6983, Attn: Sharon Walker. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The NACIS code for this action is 541690. The Central Region Administrative Division (CRAD) requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number.

<DESC><p>The 565 CBSS / GBLB located at Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC) is issuing the attached "draft" Performance Based Work Statement (PBWS) to obtain industry input toward the acquisition and sustainment of the Versatile Depot Automated Test Station (VDATS). It is the intent of the Government to award a five to ten year Performance Based Acquisition (PBA) contract for this effort.
<p>There is potential that this effort may be set aside for small business. However, significant on-going market research by the Government will be the deciding factor.</p>
<p>The VDATS was developed organically by the Air Force to support multiple weapon systems. This tester is designed to eventually replace most of the legacy testers currently in use by the Air Force depots.</p>
<p>In order to expand our market research, an Industry Day will be hosted at Robins AFB, GA, in the Air Force Museum, beginning July 28, 2008 and ending July 30, 2008. During this time, interested sources will have the opportunity to pose questions and provide input into the requirement development. In addition, the Government will use this Industry Day as a means of gauging the availability of qualified commercial sources. Since our organic maintenance capability will largely depend on the availability of the VDATS, the Government intends to utilize a rigorous source selection process to ensure award is ultimately made to the source that offers the best value to the Government. Of utmost importance is demonstrated experience to: 1) build similar automatic test equipment (ATE) to include acquiring parts, assembly and testing; 2) support similar ATE through the management of multiple suppliers, supply chain integration, and in-house technical capability.</p>
<p>Industry representatives should be prepared to discuss execution risks associated with the PBWS, and any appropriate best commercial practices that could be incorporated into the strategy. The Government will also lead a discussion on risks and the general source selection criteria anticipated. To finalize the Industry Day dialogue and collection of ideas, scheduled times will be allotted for one-on-one discussions as requested by each contractor in attendance.</p>
<p>All reservations for this event must be made starting July 9, 2008 and no later than July 14, 2008. Please contact the Industry POC at Linda.Ralston@robins.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>Department of Energy Nuclear Suppliers Outreach - Denver, ColoradoHyatt Tech Center HotelDenver, ColoradoJuly 31, 2008Background and Purpose of the Supplier ForumThe Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM), andtheNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), will be co-sponsoring aSuppliers Outreach event with the Energy Facility Contractors Group (EFCOG)andthe Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) for suppliers interested in providingservices and products in the nuclear sector on July 31, 2008 in Denver, CO.This nuclear suppliers outreach event is an excellent opportunity forcompanies interested in working in the DOE nuclear sector to gain insightsintothe current and future markets for products and services, and requirementstoenter or to continue to work on nuclear projects in the DOE-complex.  Inaddition, participants will have the opportunity to interact directly withsenior executives, project managers, and procurement personnel working forDOEand its prime contractors; and, gain insight into Nuclear Quality Assuranceprogram requirements applicable to both the DOE and commercial nuclearindustrysectors.The purpose of this forum is two fold.  First, it will help ensure that allEMand NNSA sites have an adequate number of qualified nuclear and non-nuclearsuppliers for future projects and programs.  Second, it will provideinformation for suppliers regarding the needs of DOE projects and programsfortheir products and services in the years ahead.  By providing products andservices to DOE for its nuclear projects, companies may become qualified tosupply similar products and services to the commercial nuclear powerindustryas the commercial nuclear renaissance in the U.S. and overseas evolves.Who should attend?Suppliers who wish to provide their products and services to DOE for itsprojects and programs for both nuclear and non-nuclear applications.Services,for example, would include safety analysis, engineering, design, andconstruction.  Examples of products include engineered items, piping,valves,pumps, heat exchangers, cables, electrical components, and duct work.Executives and business development, sales, and marketing professionalswillfind the forum very informative and support potential expansion of theirbusinesses into the DOE and commercial nuclear markets.RegistrationThere is no registration fee for the conference but you must register.Register at: http://www.prc8a.com/doenuclearsuppliersoutreachmeeting/

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT:  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, it is the Governments intent to award a sole source service contract to Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation (GTRI), 505 Tenth Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0001, for the Cochiti Baseline Study: Independent Review and Outreach.  THIS IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION.  This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.  No solicitation document is available, and telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation will not be honored.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  All responses received within 15 days will be considered.  If no affirmative written response is received, the service contract will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed service contract is based on the fact that GTRI has been assigned as the southwestern region research and development center for hazardous substances technology and outreach by the EPA, and also due to Tribal Sovereignty of the Pueblo de Cochiti.  The Cochiti Baseline Study is located almost exclusively on Trust and Fee lands of the Pueblo de Cochiti, a federally recognized Native American Tribe.  As such the government has specific responsibilities to safeguard sensitive Tribal resource information.  GTRI has significant experience in working in similar situations and has agreed to conform to confidentiality agreements and protocols between the Government and the Pueblo de Cochiti.  Award of this service contract will be based upon the EPA requirements and the Tribal sensitivity issues, the possible responses to this notice, and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the following email addresses no later than 2:00 PM (MST) 16 July 2008, linda.j.anderson@usace.army.mil or Madeline.e.livermore@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>NASA intends to extend Contract NNA04BC25C with Eloret Corporation on asole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, insupport of Ames Research Center's (ARC) Code TS, Space Technology Division.  Theobjective is to extend the performance period for five months.The current Contractor provides the following mission critical support services underSpace Technology Research and Development (STRAD).  The principal purpose of thiscontract is to support the Space Technology Division at NASA Ames Research Center toobtain the services needed for the development of technologies for use in the design andfabrication of prototype vehicles that travel at hypervelocities in the atmosphere ofEarth and other bodies in the solar system. The Contractor provides support in the areasof Reacting Flow Environments, Nanotechnology, Thermo-physics Facilities, and ThermalProtection Materials and Systems.  This extension will allow for a continuation ofservices to ensure program continuity and critical mission support and avoid significanttechnical impacts while a competitive follow-on acquisition is completed.  The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA04BC25C,value and extend the period of performance for a period of five months, from October 1,2008 through February 28, 2009. The current contractor, Eloret Corporation is consideredthe only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short period of performance forthe extension.	Awarding a five-month contract to another source, at the same timerecompetition of the follow-on is in process, would not allow for sufficient phase-inperiod, thereby affecting the seamless continuity of services and cause unacceptabledelays in fulfilling ARCs requirements.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:00 PM. PST on July11, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose ofdetermining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

Questions regardingthe extension can be sent via email to Lana Jones Clemon at Lana.Jones.Clemon@nasa.gov.An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<SUBJECT>Radio-Synthesis of 11C-docetaxel.
<SOLNBR>1043416-1
<RESPDATE>071508
<CONTACT>Vida - Niles, Phone 301-827-2476, Email vida.niles@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration(FDA) is seeking full and open competition for vendors capable of providing service for a project titled:  Radio-Synthesis of 11C-docetaxel.

The Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology at FDA has developed a micro-synthesis using CO2 as the donor to form the tert-butylcarbonate group on the side chain connected to the main Baccatin moiety. 11C-CO2 is a common cyclotron product that can be used with this method to generate 11C-docetaxel.  The contractor must have access to a cyclotron and have sufficient experience in 11C production and synthetic chemistry to generate the 11C starting material and 11C-docetaxel final product.

Request for Quotes - Statement of Work  Reference #  1043416
The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, services, materials, and otherwise perform all necessary functions, in the performance of the work as described below.  The primary amine form of precursor is available from the Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology at the FDA.

I.	Work closely with the project officer and study liaison throughout the lifespan of the contract.

II.	The contractor shall synthesize 11C-docetaxel based on the procedure developed by the Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology (LCP) at FDA. 

a.	The contractor will perform the synthesis of 11C-docetaxel following the procedure developed by LCP. The procedure uses 11CO2 mixed with potassium tert-butoxide followed by the addition of methanesulfonyl chloride to produce 11C-di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (diBOC). The docetaxel precursor is reacted to complete the synthesis 11C-docetaxel.

b.	The contractor shall follow alternate synthesis methods of 11C-docetaxel from published literature or developed at their site to compare with the procedure described in 2a. The radiolabeled carbon may be in the form of 11CO2 or other forms of 11C. 

The synthetic process that is most facile with the least steps or shortest synthesis time and yields the most 11C-docetaxel will be used for isolation and purification steps suggested in 3 below.


III.	The contractor is required to purify the 11C-docetaxel after it is made. The suggestion is that the contractor follow procedure IIIa. IIIb allows the contractor to perform a different purification if the contractor so chooses. 

a.	The reaction mix from 2a or 2b is dried and then dissolved in a small volume of 40% ethyl alcohol. It is passed through a strong cation solid phase exchange column (SPE) followed by more 40% ethyl alcohol. The pooled elutions are diluted with water and passed through a C18 SPE, washed with water, and eluted with MeOH. The MeOH elution containing the 11C-docetaxel is dried and a final purification step is performed by peak collection from HPLC.

b.	The contractor shall develop and follow alternate purification methods of the reaction mix from 2a or 2b.

IV.	The contractor shall optimize the full procedure from isotope generation to final 
injectable product while maintaining records of failed attempts and successful improvements.

The contractor shall show that a sufficient quantity of final product can be produced with a specific activity and product quality required for patient imaging. 

Period of Performance:

The FDA anticipates a one year period of performance from the time of award.

Deliverables:

The contractor shall issue monthly status reports to the project officer and study liaison indicating the progress since the last report.  Due at the end of each month.  

At the completion of the project the contractor shall provide 
I.	Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the complete optimized production, synthesis, and purification processes under the Scope of Work above.  Due 30 days after the completion of the project. 
II.	Final report to include a summation of the results of the monthly reports and conclusions drawn from the findings.   Due 30 days after the completion of the project.
III.	 Reports shall be submitted in wordformat electronically via email upon due date.


Evaluation criteria:					100 Points

The vendors should note that the evaluation criteria serve as the standard against which all technical information will be evaluated, and serve to identify the significant matters which vendors should address.

I.	Regular access to 11C
Scoring will be base on the availability of  11C for repeated attempts at at synthesis and purification of 11C-docetaxel.     30 Points

II.	Experience in multistep radiosynthesis with 11C
Scoring will be based on the experience of the contractor in performing multistep radiosynthesis with 11C.   50 Points

III.	Potential for clinical collaboration with Oncology Unit.
11C-Docetaxel will eventually be imaged in oncology patients as part of another study.  Ideally the radiosynthesis of 11C-docetaxel for the oncology study will be performed in the same radiochemistry lab that the initial synthesis was performed.  Scoring this element will be based on the potential for collaboration with a unit that can provide oncology patients for imaging studies.   20 Points

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR QUOTES (RFQ).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  QUESTIONS DEADLINE:  all questions must be received by email (vida.niles@fda.hhs.gov) before 10:00 AM  EST on July 7, 2008.

<DESC>This is a Brand Name Only requirement and a small business set-aside.  NGA has standardized ProLiant servers.  Maintaining the same hardware architecture minimizes total cost of ownership.  All LAN components within a network need to work with all other components flawlessly.  Any part that is incompatible or malfunctioning will quickly degrade the entire network performance to an unacceptable level.  This complexity and fragility is one reason that NGA must continue to maintain their HP servers.  The period of performance for this warranty is 01 April 2008 through 31 March 2008.  Evaluation will be based on lowest price technically acceptable.  See the attachment for the item details.  Please submit a HP factory direct quote; third party quotes will not be considered.  If you have any questions concerning this correspondence, please contact April Merriwether at April.N.Merriwether@nga.mil.

The MT ARNG supply sergeant, SSG Brian Johnson (406-265-3444) will provide a head count to the contractor after the first meal on the first day of each training period.  The Contractor will adjust accordingly, and verify meal numbers actually served respectively with the MT ARNG supply sergeant after each event.   The head count sheets tracked by the supply sergeant and reconciled with the Contractor will be used for Government tracking purposes only.<BR><BR>3.  MENU<BR>  <BR>3-1.	The Contractor shall serve nutritional meals consistent with favorable offerings served to commercial clientele.  The Montana Army National Guard strictly uses the Armys General 20 Day Menu Information when preparing soldier meals with Army cooks.  We offer it here as a guide and general standard.  Refer to (http://montanaguard.com/USPFO_Home.htm).  The meals served should include similar, but not exact, portions and servings of all food groups, beverages, and condiments indicated in the 20 Day Menu.  Contractors are encouraged to replace meals from the 20 Day Menu with nutritional meals theyve tailored and developed for commercial clientele as long as the integrity of a quality menu/meal is maintained.  For example, a contractors specialty flat bread can be used in place of wheat bread called for in the Army Menu.  <BR><BR><BR>4.  PERFORMANCE PERIOD<BR><BR>4-1. The period of performance shall start with a breakfast meal on 13 July 2008 and complete with a sack lunch meal on 2 August 2008. <BR><BR><BR>5.

<SUBJECT>Health Consequences of Vitamin D Deficiency in Older Adults in the InChianti Study
<SOLNBR>CRBSA08002 
<RESPDATE>071008
<CONTACT>Patricia L Meise, Phone 410-558-8043, Fax 410-558-8319, Email meisep@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP,  Clinical Research Branch located at Harbor Hospital intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with the Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA to undertake clinical research to assess the distribution of vitamin D levels in the InChianti cohort and to determine the health consequences of vitamin D deficiency.  The title of this project is Health Consequences of Vitamin D Deficiency in Older Adults in the InChianti Study.  This project aims to generate populationbased healthy reference range for vitamin D levels in community-dwelling older individuals who are participating in the InChianti Study.  We will measure vitamin D levels using LC-MS/MS, widely considered the gold standard for the measurement of vitamin levels.  We will first evaluate the statistical distribution of vitamin D levels in the InChianti population.  Using Lowess plots, we will evaluate the relationship of vitamin D levels with PTH and define vitamin D deficiency in terms of the threshold or the inflection point at which the PTH levels rise above the upper limit of normal.  We will then examine the cross-sectional association of outcomes (bone mineral density, walking speed, SPPB scores, muscle strength, disability, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and other co-morbid conditions) with varying degree of deviations in vitamin D levels from the reference limit.  Based on these analyses, we will generate an initial proposal for healthy range for vitamin D levels for further validation in additional analyses.  The study will require Institutional Review Board approval at both Boston University and the National Institute on Aging.  Because these analyses will utilize existing serum and data that have already been collected, they impose no additional burden on the subjects and require no further contact with the participants.  The amount of serum required for these analyses is small (100ul).  The contractor will perform the following:  1) measure vitamin D levels in 1000 individuals in the InChianti study (approximately 500 men and 500 women) using LC-MS/MS based assay; 2) analyze the data, in collaboration with Drs. Guralnik and Ferrucci and their staff, on the distribution of vitamin D levels and the cross-sectional association of deviations of vitamin D levels with outcomes in the InChianti study; 3) generate preliminary proposal for healthy vitamin range.  The contractor shall provide the assay method for the study.  The contractor will also develop and report plans for quality control and data entry.  The main deliverables are the assay results and the analytical plans for the utilization of these results.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because the Boston University School of Medicine, Boston Medical Center is internationally recognized in endocrinology with expertise in androgen biology, especially hormone assays.  They have experience that is critical for developing standardized assays for steroid hormone measurements and have a state-of-art laboratory with scientific and instrumental infrastructure to perform the vitamin D assays.  Boston Medical Center has previously led NIH-funded efforts to develop and standardize LC-MS/MS assays for testosterone and estradiol; as such, is the PI of an NIA-funded grant to generate population-based reference ranges for testosterone.   Over the last few years, Boston Medical Center has developed unique experience and insight in the specific assay methodology used in this project which allow a continuous supervision and quality control of the data generated that are crucial to the success of this project.    While the same assay could be implemented by other research groups, this would require extensive testing and validation before they become acceptable (this extensive testing would also require more sample volume which is in very limited supply), and, as a consequence, the cost of this project would become substantially higher.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt form the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.  Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest price, technically acceptable source.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price proposals for overhaul of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-08-Q-300024 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside.  The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 and the size standard is 1000 employees. This synopsis/solicitation is issued for a firm-fixed-price for the overhaul of C130H NOSE LANDING GEAR STRUTS, NSN-1620-00-505-1184, Part Number 3303591-3, the quantity of 6, which will include modifications in accordance with Air Force Technical Order 4S2-23-3, 4 (Mfg cage code 17576). The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release Air Force Technical Orders. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders. 
Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, OEM approved parts. The United States Coast Guard will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. Offerors must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with the proposal; or other certifications; (such as DOD Certification), to be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping reparables which are determined "Beyond Economical Repair".  Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage.  Components received in the above listed conditions will be handled on a case by case basis, after notification to the Contracting Officer of such condition.  Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for Unusually Damaged Items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work".  The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately.  High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices.  Nonreworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose.  Should any of the reparables be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions.  The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document.  Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule.  Delivery is required no later than 45 days after receipt of material. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to notify the Contracting Officer upon receipt of the reparables.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

 HSAR 3052.20970  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established five permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office.  The regional offices are located in San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; and Pretoria, South Africa.  The Asia sub-regional office is in Kathmandu, Nepal.
The OFDA/Asia offices cover the AsiaPacific region, which includes twenty-six countries in South, Southeast, and East Asia and sixteen Pacific Island nations. This also includes the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which will soon receive disaster assistance from USAID, in transition from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The region of responsibility is comprised of rich and poor nations, and politically stable and failing states.  It is a region of diverse cultures, languages, topographies, and disaster vulnerabilities.

OBJECTIVE

The Asia Regional Team requires the services of a Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for the Asia-Pacific Region, based in its Bangkok, Thailand office. This position requires an experienced practitioner in disaster response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. The incumbent is responsible for managing the Asia Regional Office and supervising its staff, development of the three-year Asia strategy, coordination of disaster response activities, and for the identification and formulation of disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs primarily in the Asia region.  

The PRA will actively develop and coordinate preparedness, mitigation and training programs to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region.  Frequent travel within Asia and the Pacific region will be required.


9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2) Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation - Working closely with OFDA/W and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the PRA will assist representatives of host government organizations, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.

Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA/W Asia team colleagues, will: 

	Prepare (and supervise the preparation of) regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

(1)   The following responses are provided to technical questions submitted:

QUESTION:  Do you require any specific finish on the inside?

ANSWER:  There are no requirements for the finish on the inside of the ball.

QUESTION:  Are the posts drilled through to the inside of the balls?

ANSWER:  The requirement for the connection between the post and the ball is that the connection be designed so that under twice the weight of the ball, it will not shear off, bend, and it is fixed - i.e. there is no movement between the post and ball.  The post is permanently attached to the ball.

(2)  The DUE DATE for quotations is hereby changed FROM:  Wednesday, July 2, 2008, 3:30 PM EST, TO:  Monday, July 7, 2008, 3:30 PM EST.

<DESC><p>Question 1: What type of PBX is in use (manufacturer and system model/version)?</p>
<p><br />Answer 1: There is no PBX for USUHS phone lines. They are 5ESS Verizon Centrex Lines. The switch is owned and maintained by Verizon.</p>
<p>Question 2: In your request, the initial installation is to support 2500 users; however, you also request pricing to provide VM for an additional 7500 users. The hardware specification for the server supporting the initial 2500 users will not meet the manufacturers specifications for a system of the size to support 10,000 subscribers. Shall all respondents supply pricing for a server which will also allow you to grow to 10,000 subscribers?</p>
<p>Answer 2: The requirement for 7500 additional users can be eliminated. We will probably never need that many boxes. 2500 will be sufficient.</p>
<p>Question 3: Can you please elaborate on the following request: 14) Voice to Email and Email Notification. The line item requested in the pricing section does not ask for any of the following items which could address item 14 above: Unified Messaging, Email Text to Speech, and Speech Recognition.</p>
<p>Answer 3: Voice to E-mail is an option that would allow message to be recorded and then deliver it to them over email. This is a very useful feature, because it allows users to listen to their message from their computers and then archive them appropriately. It allows them to read their messages from wherever there is an email terminal with Windows software. This is a good option to have but it is not a critical item and it can be eliminated. Unified Messaging, Email Text to Speech, and Speech Recognition are not features that we require.</p>

The Government reserves the right to award up to three contracts.  However, the Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no awards based on the quality and quantity of proposals received and/or funding availability for this program.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on or about 31 Jan 2008 with proposals due 03 Mar 2008.

<DESC>TITLE IS CORRECTED TO READ:  58 -- Personnel Locator Beacon (PLB).  
THIS IS A FORMAL PRESOLICITIATION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.204. The 77 Aeronautical Systems Group, Contracting Division (77 AESG/PSK), intends to solicit full and open competition for award of up to three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract(s) for delivery of Personnel Locator Beacons (PLB) to integrate with the Advanced Concept Ejection Seat (ACES II/III) kits and BA-22 style parachutes.  The PLB is a first alert device used to signal rescue forces that an aircrew member has either ejected or bailed out of an aircraft, and is also used to provide homing or location signals for the rescue team.  Requirements will be provided in the final Government Performance Specification Revision D issued with the solicitation.  Initial award will be for the delivery of 30 First Article units, First Article Contractor Testing, Test Plan and Test Report.  Each award will have options for subsequent production PLB quantities for ACES II/III kits (the Best Estimated Quantity (BEQ) is 6,000 each) and production PLB quantities for the BA-22 style parachutes (the BEQ is 12,500 each).  Total program requirement maximum is 20,000 units.  Each contractor's share of the production quantities will be based on when each contractor receives First Article Approval, production capability and the need date of customers.  FOB is Origin.  Inspection & Acceptance will be Origin.  Packaging Requirements shall be IAW AFMCFARS 5352.247-9009, Military Packaging and Marking and Appendix D of MIL-STD-2073-1, QUP 1, PRES-PACK B.  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334511 with a small business size standard of 750 employees is applicable.

Awards will be partially set aside for small business.  The application of the Lowest-Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) technique will be used to evaluate this procurement as follows:  The Government will perform a price evaluation as described in the solicitation on all proposals.  Proposals will be ranked from lowest priced offer to highest in two categories (small business and large business).  A decision on technical acceptability and ability to meet the required delivery schedule of the lowest priced offer(s) in these categories shall be determined.  A Performance Confidence Assessment will be conducted on these proposals.  Only those Offerors determined to be technically acceptable; determined capable of meeting the required delivery schedule; and receiving a positive Performance Confidence Assessment will be considered for award.  

The Government reserves the right to award up to three contracts.  However, the Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no awards based on the quality and quantity of proposals received and/or funding availability for this program.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on or about 31 Jan 2008 with proposals due 03 Mar 2008.  

Comments to the draft Government Production Performance Specification, Revision D, PRF-TA-PLB-001-06, dated 20 December 2007 are requested and must be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 4:00pm CST on 11 Jan 2008.  This document is posted at FedTeDS website, http://www.fedteds.gov.

Any concerns regarding this acquisition may be directed to the Contracting Officer.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels.  If your concerns are not satisfied by the Contracting Officer, interested parties are invited to contact the Ombudsman, Mr. Edward Noack at 210-536-2319 or e-mail edward.noack@brooks.af.mil.  Collect calls will not be accepted.  Please identify your business size in your response based upon this standard.  All responsible sources, including foreign vendors, may submit an offer which will be considered.  NOTE: ALL OFFERORS MUST BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRY (CCR) PRIOR TO RECEIVING ANY AWARD.  IN A

<SUBJECT>A-SpaceX Industry Day Announcement
<SOLNBR>A-SpaceX
<RESPDATE>070308
<CONTACT>Peter Rocci, Email Peter.Rocci@rl.af.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to:  (1) Delete the first paragraph in its entirety and replace with the following:   The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), on behalf of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), will be hosting an Industry Day prior to soliciting proposals for innovative, creative, and high-risk research to advance the state-of-the-art in technologies and methods for the Analysis WorkSpace for Exploitation (A-SpaceX) program. The proposed BAA will address Phase 1 of what is being conceived as a multi- phase program. A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is anticipated to be released following the Industry day, which will provide more details into this program. Phase 1 is anticipated to be a multi-million dollar program which will focus on conducting critical research and development of key technologies. Phase 1 has an expected performance period of up to 18 months. Successful completion of Phase 1 milestones and metrics, which will be specified in the BAA, will lead to Phase 2, which will focus on developing integrated systems. . The BAA will initially request white papers generally describing a performers area of interests and proposed work. White papers will be reviewed and feedback provided prior to the submission of full proposals. Separate white papers may be submitted for different thrust areas. Formal proposals will be reviewed by a selection committee. Actual awards may be determined based on formal proposals, and concurrence of IARPA management. We anticipate initial contract awards will be made by the first quarter of CY2009.

 (2) Delete the following paragraph in its entirety:  A-SpaceX MindSnaps will address the analysts dilemma of too much information and inadequate tools to deal with it.  MindSnaps are envisioned as a tool to provide analysts the ability to cut through the opaque information space, discover what is important, store it for future analysis, and recall/reload it later as needed with changes highlighted.  MindSnaps are enablers to help analysts make information associations and build upon them to test hypothesis and recognize increasingly complex patterns of relationships that may have significance to the intelligence community.    No other changes have been made.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

<DESC>T-1A Trainer Aircraft Modification to Add Combat Systems Officer (CSO) Training Capability
This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements to modify twenty-one T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include an on-board Combat Systems Officer training station for use by United States Air Force (USAF) personnel and generate the associated technical data. The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined.  Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards.  The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.
INSTRUCTIONS:
1.	Below is a document containing a description of CSO requirement and a Contractor Capability Survey which allows you to provide your companys capability.
2.	If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your companys capability in meeting these requirements.  Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities.  If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)
3.	Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research.  Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.
4.	Questions relative to this market research should be addressed to John Webb at (937) 904-4254.



REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTIONT-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability
PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
           We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data. The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010 with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2011.
	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical / engineering data on the aircraft.  The CSO solution must be FAA certified as integrated into the T-1 aircraft.

<DESC><p><br />538th ACSG has a requirement for contractor support to sustain and modify all configurations of the A-10 weapon system. The A-10 is expected to remain in AF inventory until at least 2028. This poses unique challenges in maintaining mission capability for an aging aircraft flying well beyond its original life expectancy. All task orders under this contract will fall into two primary areas: sustainment and development requirements.
<p>Sustainment is the ongoing activities and resources required to maintain mission capability, and improve mission readiness and effectiveness of the A-10 weapon system throughout its life cycle. The contractor shall perform sustainment activities as directed by task order in the technical/functional areas of avionics, structures, mechanical systems, and software. The contractor shall be capable of supporting a variety of sustainment activities in each technical/functional area including form, fit, or function changes to existing components and/or systems as a result of diminishing manufacturing sources or materiel shortages, obsolescence, reliability improvements, maintainability concerns, integrity program evaluations, failure analysis, or directed efforts.</p>
<p>Developmental activities are inherent to modifications that provide a new capability to a weapon system. As directed by task/delivery order the contractor shall use a systems engineering approach to accomplish the design, development, integration, test, production and delivery of hardware, software, and firmware that provides new capability to the A-10 weapon system. <br />This procurement is for a Multi-Award 10-year Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity contract, including a 5 year base, and 1, five-year option. It is the 538th ACSG's intent to solicit this requirement through Full and Open. The NAICS for this procurement is code 541330. For this procurement the 538 ACSG Project Team shall evaluate all properly received offers consistent with FAR 15.101-1, "Trade of process". As defined in FAR 15.101-1 <br />a) A tradeoff process is appropriate when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.<br />(b) When using a tradeoff process, the following apply:<br />(1) All evaluation factors and significant subfactors that will affect contract award and their relative importance shall be clearly stated in the solicitation; and<br />(2) The solicitation shall state whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than, approximately equal to, or significantly less important than cost or price.<br />(c) This process permits tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal. The perceived benefits of the higher priced proposal shall merit the additional cost, and the rationale for tradeoffs must be documented in the file in accordance with 15.406.<br />The approximate issue date for this solicitation is&nbsp;24 July 08. It is anticipated that responses will be required 30 days following issuance of the solicitation.&nbsp; It should be noted that all contractors are required to be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database prior to award.</p>
<p>5352.201-9101 ombudsman (paragraph (c) of the clause reads: Julie Primbs at (801) 777-0768, or email julie.primbs@hill.af.mil questions should be directed in writing to: Andrew Hatch, Contracting Officer, via email andrew.hatch@hill.af.mil , telephone 801-775-2291 or by facsimile (801) 777-6172 or Ron Hilliard, Contracting Specialist, via email ronald.hilliard@hill.af.mil, telephone (801) 777-4164 or by facsimile (801) 777-6172.</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers for RFI0008  MPRS PODS RFI
As of 1 July 2008
1.   16 June 2008
Question:   There are two different response dates noted (30 June and 9 July).  The upper right of the page states the 9 July date.  Can you please tell me which is the correct date, or clarify if different submittal types are expected on each date?
	Answer:   The due date for all material is 9 July 2008.
2.   25 June 2008
Question:   Is it the Governments intent that only the MPRS pods be replaced (utilizing the existing MPRS pylons with the new Pods)?    
	Answer:   Our intent is to provide our war fighters with the most cost effective system possible; while this may require a new pylon to satisfy the pod to aircraft interface, the new pods/pylons should not require any structural modifications to the aircraft for installation.
3.  26 June 2008
Question:   The RFI states the need of MPRS Pods on 20 KC-135R aircraft.
a.	 Should I assume 2 Pods/aircraft?
b.	The RFI does not ask for spares, so should I assume 10%?  Or does the program require a number of spares?
	Answer:   
a.	Yes, there are 2 pods per aircraft.
b.	The program office is considering requiring 6 spare pods for a total of 46; however, the RFI requests proof of logistics support  parts supply, spares, repair, support equipment and tech data, where we are looking for suppliers recommendations on the number of required spare parts and pods.

Question:   Could not find a time span/need date/schedule  for the MPRS.  Could you provide critical USAF needs dates such as 1st unit delivery date and time span, developmental/operation/cert test start, quantity needed per year?
Answer:   There is no defined schedule.  The RFI requests that responses address anticipated delivery schedule and product availability in order to help us determine a realistic fielding schedule.
5.  26 June 2008
Question:   Flight Certification: does the program require FAA certification (as KC-X requires) or military certification instead?  
	Answer:   Military certification.
6.  26 June 2008
Question:   Would a KC-135R be made available (at not charge, or if chargeable, at what rate) to perform DT/OT and certification flight testing of pylon/aircraft/pod system.  
Answer:   The program office is interested in identifying Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Non-Developmental Item (NDI) equipment that can be adapted for use on the KC-135, therefore developmental testing should be minimal; but at this time we are only looking for suppliers to provide estimates of how much testing would be required.  The costs associated with the aircraft to be used for testing does not need to be considered in these estimates.

<DESC>COMMERCIAL ITEM.  Solicitation will be posted on fbo.gov at a later date.  This project will increase the growth and vigor of whitebark pine and facilitate the natural regeneration of this species.  Several different release treatments will be implemented under this contract including: Full Release, Modified Release, and Cone Tree Release.  These treatments are thoroughly described in the technical specifications section of this document and shall include a number of activities that include: cutting, girdling, grubbing, lopping, bucking and handpiling subalpine fir and Lodgepole pine. See exhibit 2 for specific unit requirements.   LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:  The project area is located approximately 10 air miles northwest of Lowman, Idaho.  The area is located at some of the higher elevations on the Boise National Forest ranging from 7,200 ft to 8,200 feet.  The weather conditions at these elevations can be quite variable with strong winds and precipitation making difficult working conditions during the early and late summer months.  These elevations can also be a pleasant working environment during the hottest summer months.  The project area can be reached by forest roads 555 and 555BC that are accessible by standard two-wheel drive pickups during normal operating seasons.  These roads are not recommended for trailer towing due to steep grades and narrow road prism. The edge of the project area is located approximately 10 miles along FS Road 555 from Highway 21. Four wheel drive may be needed when roads, as shown on vicinity maps, are wet, icy, or snow covered.  CONTRACT TIME:    Estimated start date is late July 2008, with 30 calendar days for completion.  NAICS code: 115310. SIZE STANDARD: $6.5 Million.  100 percent Small Business Set-Aside.

<DESC><p>Amendment&nbsp;1 - To&nbsp;modify&nbsp;the response date from Monday, July 7th to Friday, July 11, 2008</p>
<p>NOTICE OF INTENT SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS
<p>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Oxford Instruments America, Inc., of Concord, Maine, for the purchase of a Vericold Dilution Refrigerator.</p>
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) requirement for a Vericold Dilution Refrigerator that will meet the demands of the Laser Radiometry Project here at NIST, the NIST. This refrigerator will serve as the cooling vessel for the next generation cryogenic radiometer. Oxford Instruments America, Inc. is the only vendor that offers a refrigerator system that employs a "pulse tube" cooler that obviates the need for liquid helium. These characteristics meet our technical requirements. Specifically, no other vendor can meet the NIST requirement for a Vericold Dilution Refrigerator that can allow a single vacuum chamber and direct optical access to the mixing chamber, which is not the case in traditional dilution refrigerators. Oxford is the only vendor that sells a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator (VeriCold Dilution Refrigerator DR400-10) that meets the following specifications: cooling power of greater than 400uW at 100mK and a base temperature of 10mK or less.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 11 calendar days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>1. OBJECTIVE & SCOPE

1.1 INTRODUCTION
As part of its ongoing mission to align information technology investments and improve geospatial service delivery across the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Geospatial Management Office (GMO), under the direction of the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is investigating the development of a centralized geocoding platform (service and/or system) which will best serve the broad geocoding needs of the Department and its component agencies. The objective of this request for information (RFI) is to solicit innovative and efficient geocoding methodologies that provide the GMO with insight into the current state of the art both from a data content and system perspective. The information collected will help to establish a common framework from which to plan for any enterprise geocoding solution the Department may wish to develop in the future.  

1.2 BACKGROUND
The GMO works in a technical advisory capacity to maximize DHSs return on geospatial technology investments, strengthen cross-mission information sharing, and assists DHS component programs in developing collaborative technology that supports their mission domain while conforming to interoperable standards and the IT policies of the Department. With this mission in mind, the GMO has developed a geospatial solutions architecture, the Geospatial Information Infrastructure (GII), which is the technology target for the Department and its components. As part of this architecture development, the GMO has identified the need for a centralized geocoding solution that can offer the scalability and agility to meet the diverse needs of the Departments enforcement, preparedness, response, recovery mission areas.    

1.3 CURRENT STATE OF OPERATIONS
At present there are approximately 15 known geocoding engines servicing various system requirements within DHS. In this current environment, each geocoding engine and their associated reference layers are maintained by a variety of technology, data, staff and other ongoing operations and maintenance infrastructure. Additionally the amount and availability of geocoding functionality from these various geocoding services is largely inaccessible to the broader end users. These current disparate configurations also hinder the ability for remote staff to access geocoding services in a manner that is timely and efficient. 

1.4 FUTURE STATE OF OPERATIONS
The future geocoding environment for DHS will be consolidated to a single solution that supports Department-wide geocoding operations. This fully integrated solution, will help to minimize overall levels of IT investment, enhance overall service delivery, and will be implemented in one of DHSs two data warehouses. Although this more centralized environment will likely exist within an infrastructure controlled and managed by the government, it should also be able to leverage distributed services for certain aspects of desired functionality and/or take advantage of a vendor supplied service delivery that might be cost prohibitive for the government to implement or would offer the desired levels of dynamic failover to a redundant service. Centralizing DHSs geocoding requirements also meets the intent of DHS Management Objective 4030, and the Departments Investment Portfolio Management Program.  

This future geocoding solution will support DHS business processes in the areas of:

Ad hoc street address matching to include validation, standardization, and geocoding,

Batch processing of street addresses to include validation, standardization, and geocoding,

Address validation, certification, correction, and other interpolative capabilities

Methods of determining and matching the location of landmarks, cities, towns, and other commonly-used geographic references (i.e. Gazetteer level functionality)

Proximal intelligence or supplemental detail on environs of geocoded results beyond simple latitude and longitude returns (i.e. demographics, political boundaries, census designation, Congressional Districts etc)

Ability to load and manage custom taxonomies, data dictionaries and GIS datasets.

Reverse geocoding capabilities to translate incoming coordinate data and dimensionalize that geo-location data to a local street address, nearest populated place etc... 

While serving the businesses processes described above are of immediate interest to the Department and the majority of its mission owners and operators, it is conceivable that a future state of operations may also optionally contain a capability to search text documents using various geographic keywords and display that information geographically on a map interface.   

This future geocoding environment will be implemented in such a way as to support the broadest end users possible, the following DHS components are specifically in scope for this desired implementation given known requirements and existing mission needs:

Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE)
Intelligence & Analysis (I&A)
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
U.S. Secret Service (USSS)
National Operations Center (NOC)
U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)

Anticipated volume/usage metrics:

The estimated monthly volume of ad hoc geocoding requests. .   500,000
The estimated monthly volume of batch geocoding requests... 1,000,000
The estimated monthly volume of unstructured (gazetteer) requests. 20,000,000	

Characteristics of the future solution may include but are not necessarily limited to the following:

Systems provisioned via service oriented architectures/automation interfaces,
Systems hosted and maintained by solution provider outside DHS firewalls,
Systems hosted and maintained by DHS within its firewalls,
Systems that provide graphical user interfaces

viii.  DHS Use Case Scenarios
In addition to describing the system/architectural elements of their solution(s), respondents should also outline how end users would specifically interact with their proposed solution(s) in the following use case scenarios:

 Batch Geocoding Use Case:
A program analyst has recently received a comma delimited export file from an existing DHS mission critical application. This file contains several hundred thousand to several million addresses which needs to be geocoded in a batch process to support follow on analysis. Some of these records share a single street address (i.e. commercial office or high rise apartment building). Any address which is not directly matched to a particular reference data set should be re-geocoded using multiple reference data sources to reconcile address mismatches. Assuming this analyst has access to the DHS intranet as well as the outside internet, please describe how this end user would interact with the proposed solution to achieve a geocoding match rate above 85% 

 Gazetteer Level Functionality: 
A variety of DHS mission domains require access to a rapid map display functionality based on simple keyword searches for purposes of geolocation and to better orient themselves to a particular area of interest quickly. Typical keyword searches used might include:

 Exact/Partial Street Address
 City/Neighborhood/County Name
 Landmark Alias (i.e Empire State Building, Golden Gate Bridge etc)

For example, a good Samaritan observes a signal flare from the 3rd floor of his beach front hotel and telephones in to a local US Coast Guard (USCG) Search and Rescue (SAR) operations center. During the call the SAR controller must rapidly translate that observer and observed information to a corresponding Latitude/Longitude, in order to best vector USCG assets to aid those in distress. Please describe how the proposed geocoding solution(s) might support this potential call center application and provide a flexible gazetteer level functionality to both DHS end users with and without outside internet connectivity.

 Ad-hoc Interactive Geocoding from a GIS Enabled Desktop Workstation
Describe how the proposed solution(s) could support a geospatial analyst using Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Geographic Information System (GIS) software application to support geocoding in an ad hoc or interactive way. Respondents should describe in detail how the proposed solution leverages both existing COTS GIS functionality and any proposed plug-ins, additional applications, and/or toolbar(s) to support accurate and efficient geocoding. Respondents may assume the geospatial analyst has access to both the DHS intranet and the wider internet.

 Geo-Entity Extraction from a Structured/Unstructured Text
Please describe how the proposed solution(s) might support a geographic keyword search across a variety of text based documents, messages, and/or reports and then display the results in a geographic context on a map display to better inform analysis and/or decision making.
