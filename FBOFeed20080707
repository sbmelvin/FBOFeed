<DESC><p>The Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Directed Energy Bioeffects Division is unique in the Department of Defense because it brings together in one organization the physical, biological, behavioral science and engineering disciplines with specialized facilities to address all aspects of the human interface with optical sources in Air Force combat operations. Due to this laboratory's focus on man as an intrinsic part of the weapon system, the laboratory is often tasked from other customers to evaluate the human aspects of their systems. AFRL must respond with technical solutions and programs that address the customer's technical requirements. Optical radiation technologies, with potentially serious hazards to aircrews, are being incorporated in many operational systems. Beyond today's target designator, rangefinder, and beamrider systems are dedicated laser systems capable of jamming and damaging both eyes and sensors. These systems have potential serious consequences for air missions, special forces operations, and security of high-value targets in both US and allied countries. In turn, similar systems can be utilized to enhance the warfighters'/peacekeepers' flexibility by allowing them to respond with non-lethal methods.</p>

<DESC><p>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to invite bids for the provision of G/A/G Secure and ECM Resistant UHF Communication for Poland.<br /><br />NC3A will be serving as the NATO contracting agency for this project. NC3A intends to use the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) One Envelope Procedure, in which the price proposals are opened and evaluated and the bids ranked in order by lowest price. Technical Evaluation then commences with the lowest price bid until a fully compliant bid is found.<br /><br />The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-12546-POL-GAG. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>The successful contractor may be required to handle and store classified information up to the level of NATO SECRET. In addition, contractor personnel working on NATO sites will be required to hold individual security clearances of NATO SECRET. Only companies maintaining such facilities and personnel clearances will be able to perform the resulting contract. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.</p>
<p>Bidders will be required to quote for the provision of ground, secure, and ECM resistant UHF radio infrastructure with the associated remote control capability, and with additional VHF- and UHF-band ancillary equipment to include hardware, software, documentation, testing, installation, training, and transition on-site support.</p>
<p>A minimum of one year warranty period will also be included for maintenance and support of the systems. Quotations shall be on a fixed price basis for the total of the contract.</p>
<p>Bidders will be required to bid for UHF radios that are capable of operation using the Have Quick II standard. If SATURN radios are bid, they must be capable of operation in Have Quick II mode. If Have Quick II radios are bid, it must be possible to upgrade the radios to the SATURN standard, while still retaining the capability to operate in the Have Quick II mode. In the latter case, the bidder will be required to quote for the related option referring to the upgrade of Have Quick II radios to SATURN. This option will be part of the evaluation.</p>
<p>The bidders will also be required to quote for options referring to additional equipment to be installed in additional sites in Poland. The options will be part of the evaluation.</p>
<p>The solicitation will require the bidders to guarantee that the radio frequencies specified are compatible with the regulations and controls of the nations and that national frequency clearances will be obtained as appropriate.</p>
<p>The bidders will have to take in to account that the installation will be performed on existing sites, which have electromagnetic and infrastructure constraints.</p>
<p>The solicitation will include a requirement for prospective bidders to demonstrate their ability to undertake this project, and mandatory criteria for extensive experience with the provision of similar types of systems.</p>

<p>Firms are allowed to bid independently or as members of a consortium according to the principle of equal treatment. The structure of any form of consortium shall be demonstrated by relevant legal actions, to be submitted on the bid closing date. If such legal actions are not submitted, the offer shall be considered as non-compliant. In any form of consortium, there shall be a legally appointed representative, which may be a person or a firm and will be addressed as the prime contractor.</p>

This process continues to this day.  The Kemmerer Field Office is contracting completion of some of grazing permit renewal Environmental Assessments (EA) to complete the remaining within the congressionally mandated schedule of September 2009.  The use of contractors to assist in the preparation of NEPA documentation is intended to complement Bureau of Land Management (BLM) staffing resources.2.0	BACKGROUNDAfter the enactment of the Taylor Grazing Act in 1934, grazing allotments were created and the number and kind of livestock, as well as season of use, were established for the area.  In 1946, the Bureau of Land Management was established and in the 1950's and 1960's range surveys were completed on the public lands to determine the amount of forage being produced.  Following these surveys, grazing capacity for the allotments was adjudicated.  The number of livestock authorized on most of the allotments was decreased to facilitate meeting certain management objectives such as healthy rangelands, sustainable forage production, etc.  In order to conform with the Taylor Grazing Act, grazing has traditionally been authorized on grazing allotments within the Kemmerer Field Office. The Contractor will be helping with term grazing permit renewals.  ONLY Offers submitted electronically through ideasec.nbc.gov website will be accepted. Posted on ideasec.nbc.gov as well.

<DESC>The National Supplier Clearinghouse - Medicare Administrative Contractor (NSC-MAC) is the single organizational entity responsible for issuing or revoking Medicare supplier billing privileges for suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) and maintaining supplier files that contain information collected via the Medicare enrollment application (CMS 855S).
The NSC-MAC was developed because of the unique and specialized requirements that distinguish DMEPOS supplier enrollment from that of other Medicare providers and suppliers.  In particular this includes special licensing, insurance, inventory, etc.  The unique standards that DMEPOS suppliers must meet are contained in 42 C.F.R. 424.57.  The primary function of the NSC is to, at a minimum, 1) ensure that only qualified suppliers of Durable Medical equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) are enrolled or remain enrolled in the Medicare program; 2) take necessary actions to revoke enrolled suppliers who no longer meet supplier standards; 3) establish and maintain a fraud prevention and detection program; 4) process DMEPOS supplier enrollment applications and appeals in a timely manner; 5) participate in the development, testing, and transition/implementation/operation of the Provider Enrollment Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS) for DMEPOS suppliers; and 6) ensure that all DMEPOS suppliers are properly accredited.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a solicitation for the National Supplier Clearinghouse Medicare Administrative Contractor (NSC-MAC). It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee plus award fee contract will be awarded with a base period plus 4 option years. CMS intends to solicit this requirement as a full and open competition. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of Request for Proposal in late May/early June of 2007 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is December 2007.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), DERA has a requirement for the Laboratory of Molecular and Biophysics (LMB) for the purchase of a Multi Element Deformable Mirror System to support the Adaptive optics research. 

This new research will exploit new optical devices, first developed for astronomy, but applicable to  biological microscopy. Atmospheric seeing is a distortion which can be compensated with optical elements such as Adeformable mirrors.   The mirrors essentially refocus each of many pixels independently in an image.  The technology exploits tiny actuators under each of many elements inside the mirror, (which can either be segmented or smooth) to advance or retract a few microns (10**-6m) each.  Computer control of these high-voltage actuators optimizes the overall focus.  Rather than Adeblur@ the sky, the Laboratory seeks to compensate for blurring of a similar nature that occurs when one attempts to view microscopic images more than 100 microns deep in living tissue.  For these particular studies, the deformable mirror should meet or exceed the following specification:

(1)  Contain a grid of over 120 mobile elements, (2) be coated with silver for near-infrared reflectivity enhancement and low thermal load, (3) have an element stroke of over 3 microns, and (4) have size <9mm, to match back aperture of microscope objectives.       

This requirement is under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, Size Standard is 500 employees.  The Small Business Set-Aside does not apply. 

The market research conducted has determined that there is no reasonable expectation of receiving offers from two (2) or more small businesses.  

The Government=s estimated expected delivery date is 30- 45 days or sooner after receipt of the purchase order. 

The reference number is NHLBI-PB(HL)-2008-170-DDC. 


Proposals are due July 22, 2008 by 8:30 a.m. local time. The award will be made based upon the technical specifications of the required products and delivery period in this synopsis, and to the lowest price, technically acceptable quote meeting the Government=s requirements. The offerors must submit written descriptive literature of the product in their proposal, an itemized price list and warranties of the product quoted.  The Government intends to evaluate offerors and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a technical and price standpoint.   However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later it is determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers, waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  The offeror=s proposal=s must include an itemized price lists of charges, complete description of services, complete address for invoice payment and purchase order delivery, prompt payment discount terms,  the Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and certification of business size of the company.  The offeror must also register in the Government=s Contractor Registry System. Note: www.ccr.gov.  
 
The proposal must reference ASolicitation number@ NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2008-170-DDC.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which if timely received shall be considered by the agency.  Proposals must be submitted in writing to the National,  Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042,  Bethesda, MD 20892-7902,  Attention: Deborah Coulter. Response may be submitted electronically to coulterd@nhlbi.nih.gov or cbelt@nhlbi.nih.gov and by fax to (301) 480-3345.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Cambridge Systematics Inc. for the Evaluation of Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) Reduction Measures.
Cambridge Systematics Inc. shall provide EPA with a meta-analysis of currently available studies on VMT reduction approaches.  These approaches can include, but are not limited to; Transportation Demand Management Measures, Smart Growth Strategies, Greater Public Transit Usage, Congestion Pricing, and Parking Fees.  Cambridge Systematics Inc. shall provide estimates on the amounts of VMT reduction possible aggregated to a national level.  These estimates might include, for instance, surveying work on the top metropolitan regions in the U.S. and extrapolating information to the national level.  Cambridge Systematics Inc. shall provide up to three scenarios that reflect minimal, moderate, and aggressive VMT reduction levels based on VMT measure implementation levels.  Cambridge Systematics Inc. shall provide a final report, with underlying data, by November 30, 2008.
Cambridge Systematics Inc. is uniquely qualified for this effort due to its proprietary access to models that are necessary to complete these analyses and its previous experience on similar efforts.  The use of Travel Demand Forecasting (TDF) models is necessary to analyze the specific changes in VMT within metropolitan areas. Cambridge Systematics has access to software packages such as Cube, TRANSCAD, and EMME/2 which will be necessary to model changes at the metropolitan and regional levels.  Cambridge Systematics Inc. also uses Freight Tools CS, a proprietary freight model developed to analyze freight planning, and will be necessary to assist in analysis of logistical improvements to reduce VMT.  
Cambridge Systematics Inc. is also uniquely qualified due to its experience in customizing and modifying Mode Choice Models (e.g. MnPASS Metropolitan Council Mode Choice) that will allow analysis of induced demand and emissions from modal shifts.  In addition, Cambridge Systematics Inc. performed similar analyses last year that identified and analyzed many similar VMT reduction measures.  This evaluation will expand, update, and provide a more detailed analysis on the previous evaluated VMT reduction measures. 
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the required Evaluation of Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) Reduction Measures may submit appropriate documentation within 15 calendar days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

Description

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is considering the introduction of state of the art Data Services into the Global Information Grid Services (GIG) Core Enterprise Services (CES) Architecture. This is a request for information (RFI).

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is considering the introduction of state of the art Data Services into the Global Information Grid Services (GIG) Core Enterprise Services (CES) Architecture. This is a request for information (RFI).

DISA is seeking information from industry on state of the art Data Services Technologies & Architectures, and metadata products that support Messaging, Mediation, Discovery, Publication, Subscription, Content Management,  and Security services to ensure that it has considered all available commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products that provide this capability. This RFI includes but is not limited to software specifications to include: data management tools, interface software, data catalogs, formatting tools, data quality control, metadata management, translation and correlation capabilities, and integration support from all manufacturers and suppliers Data Services.

THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR 
TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. However, this RFI will be the basis for collecting information on products available, and as a result of information received; the government may enter into Product Loan Agreements for trial and testing of products identified. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.     Information provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition   process for the Data Technology products. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

1. Introduction: Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) provides the foundation for network-centric operations by creating a set of nine core services for joint and service systems to use. NCES is part of the larger Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Services (ES). The GIG ES supports the entire Department of Defense Information Technology (IT) requirements, including the Business and War-fighting domains, as well as interfaces with the national Intelligence Community (IC) domain.

As the enterprise services component of the Global Information Grid, NCES is the infrastructure on which Department of Defense (DoD) computer applications (e.g., C2, Combat Support, and Medical) rely. This new environment must:
(1)	Support posting data to common storage spaces as early as possible,
(2)	Alert edge users to changes in relevant DoD information or time-critical events affecting their survival or threatening their mission, 
(3)	Provide users, down to the last tactical mile, with the capability to pull whatever they want, whenever they want, from wherever they are and limited only by the commanders information management policy, 
(4)	Ensure information assurance (IA)/security, 
(5)	Support interoperability among allies, coalition, and multinational partners.  

NCES relies upon the GIG transport services and tactical communications systems for exchange of information with the Core Enterprise Services (CES) and the Community of Interest (COI) capabilities. Data Services is an inherent component of NCES and the CES are dependent upon a robust set these services to support the domains COI.     

The NCES facilitates data sharing and reuse of the many redundant, dissimilar, but overlapping, data stores used in legacy applications by making use of a set of standard NCES compliant data services engineered from components that blend multiple data technologies. To do this, the data engineering team provides architectural definition of data services that support discovery, data access, mediation, collaboration, security, and content management services. NCES defines the data management services, support tools, engineering support services, and legacy data migration guidance for system developers and administrators and end user applications on the network that will enable both horizontal fusion and vertical integration of data sources. These tools and services allow easy organization and publication of existing data components to encourage reuse and migration away from application-centric data stores to NCES data management services. These services will provide the ability to post information to public space, advertise requirements, advertise service offerings, publish content in easily accessible form, precision discovery of needed information efficient pull and reliable subscription, alerts, tip-offs, notifications of significant events collaboration among geographically dispersed team(s) asynchronous (intermittently connected) operations, expanded messaging capability, and comprehensive help. Under the NCES, application developers use common data-related services rather than re-implementing them for each application. NCES shall use COTS products, relational database management systems (RDBMS), message-oriented middle-ware, and GOTS products (metadata registries) to provide mainline data services. NCES emphasizes coordinated management of the sharable data structures and semantics employed within heterogeneous data product frameworks. 

The purpose of this RFI is to perform market research. Information from industry is required for planning purposes about COTS software products that enable the government to define a comprehensive set of data service requirements.  The requirements shall be used to formulate a strategy for development and integration of the CES defined in NCES. Since NCES is a data centric program, the government requests information concerning Data Services Technologies software in support of Mediation, Data and Service Discovery, Publication & Subscription, Messaging, Security (Information Assurance) and Metadata Management services of the GIG. These services are defines as follows: 

Mediation
Services that help broker, translate, aggregate, fuse or integrate data, providing capabilities that enable transformation processing (translation, aggregation, integration), situational awareness support (correlation and fusion), negotiation (brokering, trading, and auctioning services) and publishing.


Data and Service Discovery
The set of services that enables the formulation and execution of processes to locate data assets (e.g., files, databases, services, directories, web pages, streams) by exploiting metadata descriptions stored in and or generated by IT repositories (e.g., directories, registries, catalogs, repositories, other shared metadata storage).

Messaging
Services that support synchronous and asynchronous information exchange. Selected capabilities used to exchange information among users or applications on the enterprise infrastructure (e.g., Email, DMS, VMF, USMTF, TADIL, OTH, Message Oriented Middleware, AOL instant messenger, Wireless Services, Alert Services).

Publication and Subscription
The services that provide the capability to publish data or services to the public space and the ability of of  COIs to subscribe to them.

IA/Security
Capabilities used in addressing vulnerabilities in networks, computing infrastructure, core services, and/or discreet systems. The set of services that provides Defense in Depth to ensure the integrity and continuity of the information environment and the information it stores, processes, maintains, uses, shares, disseminates, disposes, displays, or transmits.

Metadata Management
The capability to catalog metadata artifacts, manage their configuration, share the artifacts among various COIs, and provide reuse capabilities to service developers.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Description:

NAICS  562910.  General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting competitive proposals for an Indefinite Quantity Contract for Asbestos Abatement, Greater Southwest Region (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, 
New Mexico, and Texas).  This procurement is a set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVO).

This procurement is an Indefinite Quantity Contract for Asbestos Abatement in Government-owned, GSA controlled or leased buildings in various counties/parishes in the Greater Southwest Region (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas).  The Asbestos Abatement IDIQ Contract is for a period of one (1) year from Notice to Proceed, with four 1-year options, not to exceed five years.  The maximum ordering limitation is up to $1,500,000.00 (One Million Five Hundred Thousand) per year.  The guaranteed minimum shall be $500.00 per each one-year period.  A bid guarantee will be required in the amount of $200,000.00.  THE SUCCESSFUL FIRM WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT ALL LOCATIONS WITHIN THE GREATER SOUTHWEST REGION (ARKANSAS, LOUISIANA, OKLAHOMA, NEW MEXICO, AND TEXAS).  See ATTACHMENT A  City Listing(s), includes but is not limited to the cities listed.  The successful firm shall have the capability to perform work at several sites simultaneously and to handle large projects.  More than one project may be in progress at any one given time or location during the term of the contract.  The successful firm shall have the capability to respond rapidly on an emergency as-needed basis for the Greater Southwest Region (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas).  This negotiated procurement will be accomplished by using source selection procedures, which will result in award of a firm fixed price contract to the contractor offering the best value to the Government.  Technical ability is significantly more important than price.  Work includes all asbestos abatement (construction) activities, but may require the contractor to make site surveys, to provide determination for confirmation of asbestos scope of work on site, to take bulk samples of suspected asbestos containing materials (i.e., ACM), and prepare reports on the results of the site surveys.  The work will primarily require asbestos workers, building laborers, carpenters, lathers, plasterers, insulators, truck drivers, industrial hygienists and other disciplines with specialized experience.  Projects will primarily involve asbestos abatement, but may also include selective demolition and/or restoration, including re-insulation, reinstallation of ceiling, lighting, etc.  The successful contractor must have a minimum of five (5) years experience as a licensed asbestos abatement contractor in at least one or more of the following states:   Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas.  All work performed under this contract shall be performed by licensed asbestos abatement parties (either a Prime Contractor and/or Key Subcontractor) that is licensed in the state and/or municipality in which the work is to be performed.  

Proof of licensing and of the requisite experience will be verified prior to awarding a contract, or any delivery order issued under the contract.  The Government may or may not hold discussions on technical proposals (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a); therefore, the offerors proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  The Government is not limited to contacting only those references provided by the offeror.  The Government may also consider the offerors performance on contracts not submitted by the offeror that the Government is aware of, or becomes aware of.  

Technical factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Experience and Past Performance is significantly greater in importance than each of the remaining factors.  (1)  Experience and Past Performance of Prime Contractor and Key Subcontractors; (2) Experience, Past Performance and Qualifications of Key Personnel; (3) Management and Technical Approach.  Offerors will not be reimbursed for proposal submittal expenses.  The Government furnished line item listing in this contract will be the primary ordering source.  If the awarded contractor refuses to accept work for any line item included in a task order issued under this IDIQ contract the Government will deem this to be a material breach of the contract and may terminate the contract for cause, without additional expense to the Government.  Any documents related to this procurement will be available via the Internet only.  No hard copies will be available.  Contractors are responsible for downloading their own copy of all documents.  These documents will be in .pdf(Adobe Acrobat) format and will be available at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about July 23, 2008.  It is the contractors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any information or documents in the special notices, the solicitation and amendments, if any.  Contractors can also register to be notified by e-mail of new postings including synopsis, solicitations, and amendments at the site.

<DESC>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has been involved with aquifer monitoring at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) since the early 1950s.  Hundreds of monitoring wells have been drilled on and around the INL to examine the fate and transport of contaminants and to characterize the regional aquifer system.  In collaboration with the INL, the USGS has started a new phase in aquifer monitoring that includes the use of deep (up to 1,400 feet) vertical monitoring systems that allow for the collection of pressure, temperature, and water quality data at specific depths within a single borehole.  Using a series of inflatable packers to seal the open-borehole, data can be collected and analyzed that will add 3-dimensional control for ongoing numerical modeling.  Results will be used to verify where contaminants are moving as they disperse through the aquifer.
Open boreholes do not allow for measurement of vertical variation in pressure, temperature, or water quality.  Mixing of water chemistry and pressure occurs inside of open boreholes and can change or dilute the pressure or water chemistry.  To better characterize the shallow, intermediate, and deep aquifer system of the eastern Snake River Plain, a vertical monitoring system is needed that meets borehole diameter limitations (3.5 to 4.8 inch) and that can monitor at depths 1,400 feet or greater where the water table can exceed 600 feet.  
To meet this need, the USGS intends to award a non-competitive purchase order to Schlumberger Water Services USA for additional components that will be used with our existing Westbay MP55 system network.  These additional components include (82 each) MP55 Casting 1 (3M/10F), (80 each) MP55 Regular Coupling, (25 each) MP55 Measurement Ports, (1 each) MP55 End Plug, (19 each) MP55 Packer - 100mm, plastic mandrel, and (1 each) Well Head Completion Kit of MP55.  This solicitation will be issued on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1) and the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled "Acquisition of Commercial Items."  The USGS has an existing inventory of Westbay components and has already invested significant dollars in training and ancillary support for that equipment.  Further, the USGS is not aware of any other manufacturer currently making equipment that is capable of meeting our need at the required depth and in the small-diameter borehole that we are using.      
In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(13), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency, to the Contract Specialist no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All responses must be in writing by email to the Contract Specialist at sklingler@usgs.gov.   
This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-26, effective 12 June 2008.
NAICS 334519 - Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing.  No numbered notes apply.

Reports of like format and organization of material will be prepared for each of 20 Louisville District reservoir Lake Projects using phytoplankton data collected over the past 20 years or so from 1987 to 2007.  Variations may occur depending on sample effort limitations encountered on a year to year basis.  However, the reports are to be as inclusive as possible given stated objectives.  The reports are to be written for understanding and appreciation by the non-scientific community having an interest in algal community structure and implications regarding water quality in their respective Lake Projects.   This includes identification of spatial and temporal variations in composition and abundance.   The reports are to be well illustrated with colorful figures and tables as primary means of data display with well-written, easy to read text describing ecological implications and value in terms of indicating water quality conditions.   The reports are to be appropriately prepared and bound to attract the attention of interested readers, from the 7th grade up, and survive being handled as such.  A template report should be initially prepared for review by the Contractor and presented to the Government for final approval.  The final and accepted template report will be used as guide in report preparation for all Louisville District Lake Projects.  Reports will be utilized by personnel at each respective Lake Project for information dissemination to the general public.

<DESC>The Contractor will be responsible for the preparation of technical reports describing characteristics and trends in stream insect community structure, including composition on the genus level with notes made on species present bearing particular significance with respect to indication of water quality, impact on aquatic life, and/or other matter warranting specific attention and detail as needed.  Reports of like format and organization of material will be prepared for each of 20 Louisville District reservoir Lake Projects using insect data collected over the past 10 years or so from 1997 to 2007.  Variations may occur depending on sample effort limitations encountered on a year to year basis.  However, the reports are to be as inclusive as possible given stated objectives.  The reports are to be written for understanding and appreciation by the non-scientific community having an interest in stream insect community structure and implications regarding stream water quality associated with their respective Lake Projects.   This includes identification of spatial and temporal variations in composition and abundance.   The reports are to be well illustrated with colorful figures and tables as primary means of data display with well-written, easy to read text describing ecological implications and value in terms of indicating water quality conditions.   The reports are to be appropriately prepared and bound to attract the attention of interested readers, from the 7th grade up, and survive being handled as such.  A template report should be initially prepared for review by the Contractor and presented to the Government for final approval.  The final and accepted template report will be used as guide in report preparation for all Louisville District Lake Projects.  Reports will be utilized by personnel at each respective Lake Project for information dissemination to the general public.

Decisions involve interpretation, analysis, and negotiations regarding modification of contract terms and conditions, evaluation of contractual progress, and identification and solution of problems involving contracts assigned.  Factors vary for each situation because of variations in the terms of the contracts, products and services involved, and contractor capability and characteristics, i.e., the relationship with corporate headquarters, previous experiences, and degree of cooperation.  The work requires making final decisions on a variety of issues, such as cost and price allowability, negotiating settlements, resolving legal and technical problems, approving or disapproving expenditures incurred, estimating the percentage of completion for payment of fixed-fee, and fairness of salaries paid to Contractors employees.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:
The Department of Homeland Security is seeking sources for a potential requirement to provide strategic, technical, program oversight, and security engineering support.  The requirement entails the contractors to provide policy development and implementation support; independent technology assessments; acquisition documentation, evaluation and review support; engineering review and configuration management board support; and support for strategic planning for the National Security Systems (NSS) security initiatives and policy.  The Contractor shall also provide support services to include the provision of analyses and recommended solution(s) for issues related to the establishment, Departmental implementation, and maintenance of the Information Security Program.  


1.0 BACKGROUND:  
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Information Security (OIS), implements a Department level Information Security Program under the management of the DHS Chief Information Security Officer.  This office ensures compliance with Federal law, regulation and policy regarding information security and information technology, including the Computer Security Act, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), the Clinger-Cohen Act; Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Executive Orders, and Homeland Security Presidential Directives. 
OIS requires support to perform two critical missions.  First, the office requires contractual support to develop policy, standards, and architecture that can and will impact procurement decisions and therefore, must be vendor neutral.  Second, the office requires contractual resource to develop and implement Department level performance metrics.  


2.0 STATEMENT OF NEED:
OIS requires independent and unbiased systems/security engineering analysis and guidance, along with strong technical support resources to maintain and improve an existing security program.  The nature of the work requires an organization that operates in the public interest with objectivity and independence, with full disclosure of its affairs to the government and, is free from organizational conflicts of interest and from restrictions created by a commercial relationship, with full disclosure of its affairs to the government.  In order to discharge its responsibilities to the Information Security Office, the organization will be afforded access, beyond that which is common to the normal contractual relationship. This includes access to Government and supplier data, including sensitive and proprietary data, and to employees and facilities. The access will preclude the organization from bidding on and serving as the prime or sub-contractor on any DHS procurement that is the result of or effected by the analysis and guidance. Furthermore, the organization will maintain the confidentiality of this information through a trusted relationship with the government.  


This is not a Request for Quotation. Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by DHS to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling the above requirements.   


Interested parties shall submit a capability statement electronically to Stefanie Conway, at stefanie.conway@dhs.gov 12:00p.m E.S by July 16, 2008.

Participation by non-U.S.organizations is welcome but subject to NASAs policy of no exchange of funds, in whicheach government supports its own national participants and associated costs.The objectives of the ACT Program are to research, develop, and demonstrate component-and subsystem-level technology developments that: Reduce the risk, cost, size, volume, mass, and development time of Earth observinginstruments and platforms, and Enable new Earth observation measurements.The ACT segment of the overall Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) program advancescore component technologies to a technology readiness level (TRL) that enables them tograduate to other programs, such as the Instrument Incubator Program, or to directlyinfuse them into a mission.This opportunity focuses on advancing the components and subsystem technologies that arenecessary to implement the measurements described in the National Research Council's(NRC) Decadal Survey (Reference: Earth Science and Applications from Space: NationalImperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond, ISBN: 0-309-66900-6 (2007) or access a freepdf download from http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11820.html ). Measurements called for in theDecadal Survey have been assembled into fourteen (14) mission concepts with start datesranging from 2010 to 2020 for implementation by NASA. NASA LaRC has specific interest in development of innovative components related to thefollowing mission area: ASCENDS (Active Sensing of CO2 Over Days, Nights, and Seasons).The favored sensor for the ASCENDS (Active Sensing of CO2 Over Days, Nights, and Seasons)is the advanced avalanche photodiode to operate at moderate temperatures and large areadetection for long-term lidar remote sensing at 1 um to 5 um wavelengths. Specifically,LaRC is seeking potential partner(s) for development of advanced avalanche photodiodeswith the following specifications:i. Collecting Area for each Element ~ 100-500 micron;ii. Bandwidth 10 MHz;iii. Responsivity @ 2.00 micron 60 A/W;iv. Quantum efficiency @ 2.00 micron 80%; and v. Noise equivalent power &lt;10^-14 W/rt.Hz.Teaming with providers of and leveraging emerging technologies, such as current andrecent Small Business Innovative Research awards(http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/SBIR/awards.htm ), is of special interest.If selected through this synopsis, it is expected that selected partner(s) will work withNASA LaRC scientists and engineers to jointly develop the proposal. If the proposal isselected, NASA LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the selectedpartners for performance of the proposed tasks. This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts orother agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for theinformation solicited. It is expected that the selected partner(s) would provide (at nocost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules andcost estimates. Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria inthe following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, and availability of keypersonnel. This criterion evaluates the offeror's relevant recent experience, pastperformance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform thedevelopment and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidenceof successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control. This criterion evaluates the offeror's ability to controlboth cost and schedule. The ability of the offeror to complete projects on time andwithin the modest, fixed budgets that are characteristic of Advanced Component Technologyis key.

<DESC><p>This publication serves as a notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract with Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric, National Marine Fisheries Service, Southwest Fisheries Science Center has the need to provide staff to carry out Klamath Coho Salmon Monitoring as follows:</p>
<p>Naturally spawning coho salmon in the Klamath-Trinity Basin have experienced drastic reductions to 1,497 fish in the 2007-2008 year from estimates of 15,400 fish in 1965.  Coho salmon were thought to be much more abundant prior to 1965 before large hydropower projects were constructed and are currently listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  The situation is further complicated by the introduction of large numbers of hatchery coho salmon from two large hatchery programs at Iron Gate Hatchery on the Klamath River and Trinity River Hatchery.  Monitoring efforts in the Klamath-Trinity Basin have been historically focused on the commercially important fall-run Chinook salmon rather than ESA listed coho salmon.  While the biology of coho salmon is known from studies on other rivers, there are no studies of coho salmon specific to the Klamath-Trinity Basin and there are no overall monitoring efforts.  Reports by the National Research Council's Committee on Endangered and Threatened Fishes in the Klamath River Basin, Endangered and Threatened Fishes in the Klamath River Basin, National Marine Fisheries Service's Updated status of Federally listed ESUs of West Coast salmon and steelhead and Magnuson Act Klamath River Coho Recovery Plan, all identify coho salmon population monitoring as the top requirement to fill the lack of information to support quantitative assessments of coho salmon population strength, trends and distribution.  Such Klamath-specific quantitative assessments would provide resource managers with reliable scientific information to evaluate: (1) the status of coho salmon under the ESA; (2) the potential impacts of land and water use, hatchery, and harvest practices, on the long-term survival and recovery of coho salmon; (3) high priority coho salmon recovery actions; and (4) Klamath coho salmon's progress toward recovery.  This monitoring is especially timely since passage around Iron Gate Dam has been mandated and dam removal is being considered. Conduct adult coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) surveys in the Klamath-Trinity Basin.  Currently, Chinook salmon surveys are conducted on the Salmon River, Scott River, Shasta River, Bogus Creek, Mid and Upper Klamath River, Lower and Upper Trinity River, and Trinity River tributary streams.  In each of the nine basin units, these Chinook salmon live fish or redd surveys are conducted in October and November.  However, these survey efforts end too early in the winter to be useful for coho salmon.  This project will extend the existing Chinook salmon surveys for a longer sampling period to be used to provide coho salmon estimates.   These surveys are wide spread and adding new areas are not currently envisioned.  In addition, a data technician will be needed to construct the spatially explicit sampling frame.</p>

All metal posts will be placed so that the spade is completely below the ground.  If in hard rock, the hole will be drilled to allow the steel post to be placed into the ground.  

Braces: Braces will be constructed every  mile at each gate and at each change in the fence alignment (corner) according to Forest Service standards.

Three-five post brace corners and/or diagonal end braces will be installed in all locations where a corner is formed.  Post pipe shall be buried 39 in the ground (except 24 in rock).  Line braces shall be constructed at a minimum distance of  mile, as well as at the crest of hills and the base of all drainages.  In draws where the fence wire has a tendency to pull the steel posts out of the ground, a rock or steel post anchor shall be placed at these points.  

Creek crossings:  at any major creek crossings, a separate fence will be built across each creek crossing to prevent the main fence from being destroyed in the event of high water or flooding.

Gates: all gates encountered along the fence are to be considered part of the fence.  All gates will be 16.5 (rod) wide.  Gates are to be built at a ll previous locations and will be built with 4 strands of barbed wire, two wooden posts and 48 metal stays.  Smooth wire will be used on the gate post except for the mechanical latch.   

Terrain:  the elevation runs from approximately 4000 to 7500.  The terrain rolls with draws, steep hillsides, some rock outcrops, talus slopes, as well as sagebrush, aspen, mahogany and grassland along the unburned portions.  Clearing will be done by the contractor or permittee with hand tools or a chainsaw.  Clearing is only necessary to ensure the fence is straight between braces.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

<DESC>The Navy intends to procure T-45 retrofit kits for the RAMP and associated engineering support efforts with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company.  This effort for the Navy will procure nine baseline aircraft kits to meet the FY09 requirement, an option for thirteen aircraft kits to meet the FY10 requirement, and an option for six aircraft kits to meet the FY11 requirement.  These units will be used to perform RAMP upgrades on the T-45A aircraft with the T-45C crew station and associated avionics systems, including head down displays, upgraded Pilots Display Unit (PDU), a MIL-STD-1553 data bus, standby instruments common to other platforms, and government furnished Multi-Function Color Displays and Global Positioning System-based navigation system.  Since the inception of the T-45 Training System (Full Scale Development approval was granted in 1984), MDC has functioned as the sole designer, developer, system integrator and manufacturer of both the T-45A and T-45C aircraft.  As such, MDC possesses unique expertise with respect to the design, engineering and performance details of the aircraft.

Statement Of Work:
Summary

The west side passenger elevator in the Gus Solomon Building has been out of service for several weeks because of a short to ground in the motor armature presumed to have been caused by a sheet metal screw falling onto the energized armature from the ceiling. 

Purpose

The purpose of this work is to get the elevator repaired and back in service as soon as possible at a reasonable cost to the government. An alternative to repairing the existing armature is to purchase and install a new gearless hoisting machine if it will not add significant time or cost to the Government. A new geared machine could be considered if it is feasible to make alterations to accommodate the configuration of the existing machine room

 Requirements

1. Contractor shall investigate conditions and make recommendations on the feasibility of a repair or replacement.  Contractor shall provide recommendations in their firms quotation to the Government.  
2. Contractor shall review the Statement of Services and may participate in walk-through of the service site to demonstrate an understanding of the requirements when submitting a quotation to the Government.
3. The contractor, based on the requirements and the site visit, shall examine the following options and provide the Government with a quotation that addresses the contractors findings, recommendations, anticipated time line, and price for each option that the contractor deems to be feasible:
a. Option one;  Determine if the armature repair is feasible. If an armature repair is recommended, the contractor shall include motor vendors shop pricing as a separate line item presented in quotation to the Government.
b. Option two;  The alternative is possible of purchasing and installing a new gearless hoisting machine if it will not add significant time or cost to the Government.
c. Option three; A new geared machine could be considered if it is feasible to make alterations to accommodate this configuration in the existing machine room.
d. Option four; any contractor discovered option.

4. Upon review of the requirements and/or examination of the elevators current condition that contractor shall determine if craning machine assemblies to the roof are necessary for the repair, the contractor shall provide a structure evaluation of the roof and submit this evaluation and a roof protection plan with the Project Plan in the contractors quotation if this approach is chosen. 

5. If option one is chosen the contractor must remove armature and driver assembly from hoisting machine, separate the driver from armature, lower armature through hatch and down one of the other elevators, then transport it to and from motor repair vendor. The contractor would be required to reinstall the repaired armature to produce a completely functional and running elevator and be available for any post repair testing or inspections. New motor bearings or any other recommended upgrade should be presented to GSA if they would be prudent to sustain the life of the hoisting machine.

6. Contractor shall determine if winching machine assemblies up the stairways is necessary for the repair of the elevator. If this approach is chosen the contractor shall provide a structural evaluation of the involved building systems and submit this evaluation and structures protection plan with the Project Plan in their firms quotation.

7. Contactor shall identify all subcontractors when responding to this Request for Quote.

Additional Requirements:

a. Provide all materials, labor and vendor services required to produce a complete repair as described in this Statement of Services.
b. Unless specified otherwise, all new products are to comply with Building Standards.  Building Standards are provided in Guides and Standards section of the SOS.
c. Contractor shall clean area and remove all trash created by the contractor on a daily basis; dust and other airborne materials are to be contained and removed.   Contractor shall provide their own waste removal.  The existing building solid waste disposal system is not to be used for construction waste.
d. Contractor shall develop and implement a waste management plan, quantifying materials.  Recycle and/or salvage at least 50% of construction and demolition materials.  Calculations can be done by weight or volume, but must be consistent throughout the project.
e. Contractor is responsible to secure any needed permits. GSA will provide for third party inspections if needed.

Constraints

1.The existing hatch opening is large enough to accommodate the armature so the contractor must remove armature and driver assembly from hoisting machine and separate driver from the armature before lowering it down the service hatch.

2. If the contractor wishes to use the service hatch for machine assemblies larger than the armature the contractor must submit with their proposal subcontractor costs for abatement of the pipe insulation and rerouting the two steam pipes that partially obstruct the service opening.  Alternatively, any new assemblies maybe disassembled to fit up through the hatch then reassembled.

3. The egress to the freight elevator is constructed with a wooden ramp with a rise of approximately 5/8 per foot. The weight bearing ability of this ramp is unknown. If the contractor wishes to use this ramp the contractor is responsible for the discovery of its structural integrity and for the repair costs of any damage that may incur. The freight elevator has a 42 inch door and the interior cab dimensions are 58 wide x 68 deep. It has a 2500 lb rating.

4. Rather than deal with the wooden ramp issue the contractor may chose to roll equipment across the seventh floor to the east passenger elevator. It has the same weight rating as the freight elevator (2500 lbs), a 42 door and the cab is shaped differently at 72 wide and 55 deep. The carpeting is fragile so putting down plywood is suggested.

5. NO hand trucks, carts, dollies or equipment is to be rolled through the 1st floor Broadway entrance because of damage to the pressure sensitive mats. 

6. The existing maintenance contract is with Kone.  They have done the initial disassemblyand troubleshooting. If the successful offorer is other than Kone they would need to re-hang the cab and cables and return Kones rigging to them.

7. Any new hoisting machine assemblies must be compatible with the existing Montgomery control panel	

Additional Constraints

1. Work may be performed during normal business hours which are 6am to 5pm M-F.  Work hours and schedule must be coordinated with the GSA Property Manager and the  GSA Project Manager. 
2. During business hours service site must be secured for ensure safety of all persons with appropriate signage applied to prevent entry of customers and staff.

3. Contractor is responsible to coordinate and pay the building maintenance service provider (TSSI) for their services as needed in relation to building utility systems that interface with this project.

4. Asbestos fibers have been identified in the Building Asbestos Survey in piping insulation that is in close proximity of the work site. This pipe insulation is protected by a steel jacket. If the contractor inadvertently damages materials that contain asbestos fibers GSA will manage any repair or abatement but GSA reserves the right to recover costs from the contractor. The contractor will bear any responsibility for delays in the project process caused any such damage to materials containing asbestos fibers

5. Protect finishes, equipment, carpeting, elevator doors and cab and surrounding tenants from dust and damage.

6. Coordinate access and parking with GSA Project Manger.

7. Project must be scheduled to minimize the time that adjacent spaces are off line and     unavailable for use by the building tenants.

<DESC>The USPS Sales organization manages approximately 627,310 business locations out of approximately 3 million commercial customers. To manage and grow this customer base, it is imperative that we have data elements which allow further segmentation and statistical analysis of these customers for the purposes of building sales strategy, responding to industry and market change, improving customer satisfaction, evaluating business-family relationships, and tracking the customers revenue.  

As with any sales organization, to gain more business from a customer, we must understand where the revenue is generated and who controls the expenditures.  The Postal Service has many incoming revenue streams which make identifying a customers revenue complex.  Appending the data elements requested below to our customer records allows us to roll together these multiple revenue streams and understand the true value and spending habits of our customers.  This matching process is coordinated through the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) group within Postal Service Marketing.  Once completed, the matched records are uploaded in the Sales CRM system to allow appropriate customer account planning and development.

The USPS is considering potential sources capable of providing this type of service for our organization.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, S.W, Washington, DC 20590 Telephone (202) 475-3754 Fax: (202) 202-475-3904.

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 18 JUL, 2008, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about JUL 23, 2008. Contact Cindy Soules Cynthia.d.soules@uscg.mil or 252-335-6438 for questions regarding this solicitation.  Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5240, or at the following address:

<DESC>This is a Brand Name Only requirement.  NGA has standardized ProLiant servers.  Maintaining the same hardware architecture minimizes total cost of ownership.  All LAN components within a network need to work with all other components flawlessly.  Any part that is incompatible or malfunctioning will quickly degrade the entire network performance to an unacceptable level.  This complexity and fragility is one reason that NGA must continue to maintain their HP servers.  The period of performance for this warranty is 01 April 2008 through 31 March 2008.  Evaluation will be based on lowest price technically acceptable.  See the attachment for the item details.  Please submit HP warranty service; resellers are sufficient but no other third party warranties.

<DESC>This Amendment to the solicitation provides the offerors with consultant recommended options to repair the elevator.

Option 4: Replace the existing machine with a new DC gearless. This would be a logical option if the machine could be broken down in small enough components to be brought up on the
passenger elevator. The old machine would be sawed up and taken down in pieces. The
existing controls could be retained. The new machine would be warranted.

Option 5: Provide new AC geared machine. This would be a good option providing all new state-of-theart microprocessor-based controls and the energy-saving variable voltage, variable frequency motor drives. However, the government does not recommend running geared machines over 450 fpm. Current contract speed is 600 fpm.

Option 6: Provide new AC gearless machine.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for: identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<SUBJECT>A-SpaceX Industry Day Announcement
<SOLNBR>A-SpaceX
<CONTACT>Peter Rocci, Email Peter.Rocci@rl.af.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to delete the previous announcement and all of the previous modifications and replace with the following in its entirety:

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), on behalf of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), will be hosting an Industry Day prior to soliciting white papers for innovative, creative, and high-risk research to advance the state-of-the-art in technologies and methods for the Analysis WorkSpace for Exploitation (A-SpaceX) program. The proposed BAA will address Phase 1 of what is being conceived as a three phase program. A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is anticipated to be released following the Industry day, which will provide more details into this program. Phase 1 will focus on conducting critical research and development of key technologies with contract awards anticipated as being in the range of $250K - $1000K. Phase 1 has an expected performance period of up to 18 months, and will culminate with a technology showcase for the benefit of potential users and system integrators. Phase 2 would begin at the conclusion of phase 1 and will focus on developing prototype integrated systems. The BAA will initially request white papers generally describing a performers area of interest and proposed work. White papers will be reviewed and feedback provided prior to the submission of full proposals. Separate white papers may be submitted for different thrust areas. Formal proposals will be reviewed by a selection committee. Actual awards may be determined based on formal proposals, and concurrence of IARPA management. We anticipate initial contract awards will be made by the first quarter of 2009.

Overview: 
A-SpaceX is seeking to create an analytic environment where the workspace becomes an enabler for the analytic process  fostering creativity and effective analytic reasoning. A-SpaceX envisions two key emerging technologies being fused in the workstation of the future to exploit the information available to the intelligence analyst: Virtual worlds, and Workflow management. 

Analysts will work with an integrated workstation that not only allows access to the legacy tools of today, but any number of virtual worlds designed to support the analytic process. Virtual worlds are defined here as: 1) Complex digital environments (models) that are shared across many users; 2) They may incorporate data models from a variety of sources, made up of objective data as well as hypothetical and/or theoretical constructs; and 3) Both persist and evolve whether or not any individual user is actively engaged with that world. A-SpaceX will demonstrate that this technology affords transformational opportunities to change the way people work in general, and how analysts will work in particular. A-SpaceX seeks to adapt virtual world technology to create synthetic worlds specifically adapted to support doing work. Synthetic worlds will be multi-dimensional, dynamic visualizations of that data. Synthetic worlds will be specifically developed to: 1) Highlight the dynamic aspects of the data, and how it changes; 2) Show the dynamic aspects of cognition, and how it changes; and 3) Demonstrate how groups of analysts can collaborate in the exploration of data and the sharing of analytic strategies. 

A-SpaceX envisions multiple synthetic worlds, each of which is optimized to support different kinds of analytic decision-making. Multiple synthetic worlds will be optimized for different analytic problems. The incorporation of multiple, coherent virtual worlds will require that there be a consistent set of protocols and usability standards to ensure that analysts may readily jump from one world to the next as needed to support exploring complex inter-related data. Analysts will use synthetic worlds that allow large amounts of multi-dimensional information to be explored as models. 

Implicit in the A-SpaceX vision is that changes in data will be detected by automated agents working on behalf of the analyst to both find relevant information, and highlight when data already integrated into analytic products has changed. Legacy applications will be integrated into the workspace through the incorporation of proximal displays located close to the analysts, while exploration in parallel synthetic worlds will be available through distal displays that will serve as windows into the synthetic world. Proximal and distal displays will be part of a single integrated digital desktop so that no matter how physical displays are used, the moving of information from one display area to another is as seamless as possible. 

Synthetic worlds, unlike the virtual worlds from which they are derived, will connect the analyst not only to other analysts for collaboration across users, but also with themselves and their previous states of thought about a problem. Analysts will be able to explore their own past thinking about the data as well as enabling the proactive exploration of how that data might change in the future. 

Phase 1 of the A-SpaceX program as currently conceived will have multiple thrusts: 1) Development of a Synthetic World foundation which includes an over-arching concept of operations for the employment of virtual worlds as part of the analytic infrastructure, along with the definition of prospective architectures for the use of synthetic worlds with legacy software and hardware infrastructure. 2) The research and development of key science and technologies for a Time Machine synthetic world; as well as theory & usage CONOPS specific to the incorporation & exploitation of changing data. 3) The research and development of science and technologies for MindSnaps that capture key aspects of an analysts decision-making process in conducting analyses; as well as the development of a Decision Space virtual world visualizing the analytic process.

Thrust   Synthetic Worlds Common Elements. 
Common to both the development of MindSnap and Time Machine capabilities will be the development of an overarching concept of operations (CONOP) and a shared HumanComputer Interface for the use of synthetic worlds as analytic tools. Further, the application of current virtual world technologies to support the proposed CONOP will require the adaptation of current virtual world technologies. The A-SpaceX program will therefore include a systems engineering task to address the common information technologies anticipated as being required for the use of synthetic worlds in support of the analytic tasks. During Phase 1 of the A-SpaceX program, we anticipate that these tasks will be largely limited to the definition of coherent CONOP as well as architecting the requirements for supporting systems architectures. There may be limited development of those services and the definition of knowledge representation in support of the critical services identified as being required for the A-SpaceX CONOP. 

Thrust  - Time Machine. 
Virtual worlds are in fact models that have several relevant properties: they can be shared by multiple people, they are persistent, and they evolve over time. As a model, it is possible to systematically explore temporal aspects of change of data and events that occur in the physical world. Forensic analysis can be performed by replicating the real world in a synthetic world. In this forensic mode, alternative explanations can be explored by adjusting assumptions and the quality index of the collected data and allowing the changes to propagate into the future. Proactive analysis could be explored by applying predictive models that look forward in time and suggest indicators leading to future events.

Virtual worlds allow the representation of complex, n-dimensional data sets, they can be shared by multiple people, and they evolve over time. In developing synthetic worlds to facilitate analysis, one of the more interesting aspects of synthetic worlds will be their ability to explore how data changes, and the implications of that change in formulating hypotheses about, and explanations of, change. We believe a key dimension of exploring changing data will be the ability to manipulate time in the synthetic worlds  in effect turning these worlds into Time Machines. The use of synthetic worlds as Time Machines is conceptually about the explorations of data, and as such, may be (but need not be) tied to a physical location. These synthetic worlds will allow a variety of data abstractions to be embedded, layered, and compared. A critical issue in creating a Time Machine capability will be the ability to detect and manage significant changes from data. A-SpaceX will seek research and development for technologies that will address contextually relevant change detections and management from raw data streams. Further, the complexity of the data sets possible in synthetic worlds for analysis suggest that tools to optimize how those worlds work and appear for specific analytic problems will require the development of context lens & filters that will make it possible to highlight, distort or block different kinds of data within a synthetic world. 

The CONOP for Time Machines is expected to transform how analysts would explore data. For instance, analysts can work from a here and now where they pick a perspective of interest from which to explore the data sets represented within a synthetic world. The analysts would then assess possible futures relative to their chosen perspective in place and time; effectively assessing the possibilities for then and there and developing potential hypotheses for what is possible in the future given what is known from the here and now. Another analytic CONOP might be that analysts could hypothesize a discrete (specific) future and then assess the viability of that hypothesis by exploring both known and unknown data represented in the synthetic world. In effect, the Time Machine CONOP would allow analysts to engage in forensic and proactive analysis, by viewing past/future perspectives.

Thrust  - MindSnaps. 
Current information technology is completely agnostic regarding helping an analyst to perform work. The burden is on the analyst to use tools to annotate, organize, and associate their work products. The analysts workflow process is complicated by methodology practices and security requirements of the IC that add even more tedious and time consuming activities. Today, there is no formal or proscribed mechanism for tracking analytic workflow. Current automation limitations make it extremely difficult for analysts to remember, find, and return to their analytic decision points to reconsider information changes, or try alternative hypotheses. None the less, analysts have to explain, share and propagate work products with supporting rationale to peers and managers. 

The analytic process is inherently iterative and fractionated. The analyst will typically think about one aspect of analytic problem until it is no longer fruitful, new data comes in, or a new facet of the problem becomes more salient. Analytic decision making is iterative because the analyst will often return to a previous point in his or her thinking and resume analysis from that point in time until a solution is found to the analytic problem. We believe that it will be possible to monitor an analysts workflow, and detect when the analyst has shifted their decision trajectory while engaged in this fractionated process. When a shift in decision trajectory is detected, the system would collect meta-data regarding the analysts workspace including what software applications were in use, where they were located and the data sets open in those applications. Further, by examining the work that was being done before the decision trajectory shifted, it should be possible to extract meta-knowledge about what the analyst was doing during that period of analysis. The meta-knowledge would become the basis for creating a meaningful abstraction to summarize that decision trajectory. Together, the meta-data about the workspace and the meta-knowledge data would be combined to create a MindSnap. MindSnaps will be the basis for the creation of mental bookmarks of an analysts decision making. A-SpaceX seeks to develop a research thrust that explores creating a synthetic world that will facilitate these processes. 

MindSnaps will be the foundation for developing a "Decision Space" synthetic world that maps the overall decision-making processes of analysts as graphical decision nodes, and allows them to find and, cognitively re-load their workstation from different points in their own analytic process. 

Conclusion. 
An A-SpaceX Phase 1 Industry Day will be held on July 8, 2008 from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm at the University of Maryland (UMD) Samuel Riggs IV Alumni Center located on Alumni Drive, College Park, MD. All participants must pre-register with AFRL (contact information below).  Sign in will begin at 8:00 AM and the government briefing will begin at 9:00AM. The briefing and all discussions will be UNCLASSIFIED.

The purpose of the Industry Day is to provide the A-SpaceX vision and concepts / ideas that may appear in the BAA, and solicit feedback from potential performers on key ideas and technologies. Following this presentation, there will be a general Q&A session. The afternoon of July 8th is being reserved for 15 minute private conversations with the A-SpaceX team  by appointment only. The purpose of the private conversations is to allow for general discussions relating to the A-SpaceX BAA. We will not be discussing what potential offerors specifically plan to propose. Additionally, we are providing conference call access for those prospective bidders who may not be able to physically attend.  If you are interested in participating via conference call you must pre-register (details provided upon request).  Please contact Peter Rocci (contact information below) if you are interested in attending as well as requesting a private conversation. In the event that time constraints do not permit a private conversation, a 15 minute conference call will be scheduled with the A-SpaceX team before the scheduled BAA release date on or about July 15th, 2008. 

We cannot control the types of problems that future analysts might face. We cannot control the demands for understanding information and the pressure for faster decision making. We can, however, provide the analyst with an environment that encourages creativity, reasoning, collaboration with internal and external experts, rapid exploration of alternate perspectives for greater understanding, and detecting change in data and through processes within a multi-dimensional information rich synthetic world. Welcome to A-SpaceX where its about the future.

THIS IS AN INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and NO contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.

<DESC><p>The sustainment of Eagle Vision Data Integration Segment (DIS) systems will include: hardware maintenance, software maintenance, security accreditation, configuration management, systems engineering, training, and potential updates to the DIS commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software and hardware baseline. This effort will also include the procurement of a complete DIS system for EV 6 and a configured laptop for Air Force Director of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Applications (AF/A2U) located at the Pentagon. Eagle Vision is the only deployable commercial ground station in DOD that can directly receive and process panchromatic/multispectral/SAR imagery from commercial remote-sensing satellites. Eagle Vision provides imagery products for military operations, disaster relief and homeland defense, especially for use in combat commander mission planning/rehearsal and intelligence gathering systems. DIS imagery processing includes both industry standard and government-specific output formats such as GeoTIFF, JPEG 2000, NITF 2.1, and RPF CIB. The DIS resides at each of five geographically-separated Eagle Vision sites: Ramstein Air Base Germany, San Diego, CA, Eastover, SC, Honolulu, HI, and Montgomery, AL. Each DIS system (except for EV 6 and AF/A2U) comprises six independent workstations (mix of desktops and laptops), a Local Area Network (LAN), shared storage devices, printers, and plotters. Each workstation contains multiple commodity COTS applications software for imagery, office automation, and geospatial processing applications, including ERDAS Imagine and ESRI ArcGIS. The sustainment effort will also support one workstation configured with all DIS software at AF/A2U, once those systems are procured. Additional informational about the locations and hardware/software configuration of the DIS systems may be found on the Hanscom Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB), http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/. Under business opportunities, choose systems/Hanscom for type and location. The information ! can be found under Eagle Vision Data Integration Segment (DIS). NOTE: THE SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY. THE SOURCES SOUGHT WAS POSTED TO THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES ON 12 DEC 2007 and 12 MAY 2008 WITH AN EVALUATION DEADLINE OF 27 MAY 2008. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO EVALUATE ANY MORE SUBMISSIONS.</p>

<DESC>The National Supplier Clearinghouse - Medicare Administrative Contractor (NSC-MAC) is the single organizational entity responsible for issuing or revoking Medicare supplier billing privileges for suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) and maintaining supplier files that contain information collected via the Medicare enrollment application (CMS 855S).
The NSC-MAC was developed because of the unique and specialized requirements that distinguish DMEPOS supplier enrollment from that of other Medicare providers and suppliers.  In particular this includes special licensing, insurance, inventory, etc.  The unique standards that DMEPOS suppliers must meet are contained in 42 C.F.R. 424.57.  The primary function of the NSC is to, at a minimum, 1) ensure that only qualified suppliers of Durable Medical equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) are enrolled or remain enrolled in the Medicare program; 2) take necessary actions to revoke enrolled suppliers who no longer meet supplier standards; 3) establish and maintain a fraud prevention and detection program; 4) process DMEPOS supplier enrollment applications and appeals in a timely manner; 5) participate in the development, testing, and transition/implementation/operation of the Provider Enrollment Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS) for DMEPOS suppliers; and 6) ensure that all DMEPOS suppliers are properly accredited.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a solicitation for the National Supplier Clearinghouse Medicare Administrative Contractor (NSC-MAC). It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee plus award fee contract will be awarded with a base period plus 4 option years. CMS intends to solicit this requirement as a full and open competition. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of Request for Proposal in late May/early June of 2007 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is December 2007.

<DESC><p>Description:<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI), as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) is issuing this RFI in an effort to conduct market research to solicit and survey industry for potential sources that may have the technical capability to meet its requirements and potential solutions for providing financial risk management software packages and support services related to Asset-Liability and Economic Capital Models (ECM in general). The ECM being developed by OFHEO will be used to provide alternative risk-based capital measures to supplement the statutory measures of capital adequacy of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises), and to supplement market and credit risk focused examinations. OFHEO is seeking an ECM software solution and desires to see what software technology products exist in the market. See attached for detailed information about requirements related to this RFI.
<p><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or an invitation for bid, nor does its issuance restrict the Government on its eventual acquisition approach. This is an RFI only, and all information received will be used for planning and market research purposes only. Respondents will not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided; however, information gathered may be utilized for technical and acquisition planning purposes. This RFI should not be construed as a commitment by the Government and the Contracting Officer does not intend to award a contract on the basis of your responses. All information contained in the RFI is preliminary and is subject to modification and is in no way binding onto the Government. All proprietary information sent in response to this RFI should be marked as such and will be handled accordingly. The Government will not pay for information received in response to this RFI.

Company Information. Vendors will provide a one-page summary about their company. Included in the summary will be:<br />a. The company name and address<br />b. Contact information for the financial risk management software <br />c. Size of the company in terms of revenue and employees<br />d. Years in business<br />e. Type of company<br />2. Understanding of Business Need. Vendors will state the business need fulfilled by their financial risk management software package solution in the Federal environment.<br />3. Functional Overview. Vendors will provide a description of how their software solution works for their clients, including a process overview. The information should fully describe operational functionality and describe infrastructure requirements (e.g., hardware platform, operating system(s), database server, etc.). The overview should include information to support how it&nbsp;can meet OFHEO's attached minimum requirements.<br />4. Public/Private Sector Experience. Vendors will summarize risk management software implementations of their product in the financial institution (i.e. banks, thrifts, credit unions, etc.) and Federal environments by providing a minimum of three references. Each reference should include: implementation date, current status, and reference name with contact information.<br />5. Provide information about their pricing structures and rough order-of-magnitude pricing (e.g., including software licenses, consulting rates, etc.) for their software, given their understanding of the requirements stated in this RFI. Also the response should provide an estimate of the practical implementation schedule of the approach.</p>
<p><br />Responses to this RFI should be sent to OFHEO via email in Microsoft Word format. All responses should be delivered no later than July 9, 2008, at 4:00 PM EDT and sent to <a href="mailto:Janice.Uthe@ofheo.gov">Janice.Uthe@ofheo.gov</a>.</p>
<p><br />Potential respondents may solicit further information from OFHEO via email in preparing their responses to this RFI. No telephonic discussions will be held.</p>
<p><br />If time permits and depending on the number of responses, OFHEO MAY choose to contact individual vendors for presentations to OFHEO personnel on their proposed risk management software solution. These presentations are not required, and any information provided during these presentations will be used strictly for planning and market research. Respondents wishing to take advantage of this opportunity must clearly indicate their desires in their RFI responses. Further scheduling and coordination of these presentations may be conducted once all RFI responses are received. The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the demonstration of any software products.</p>

<DESC>The National Supplier Clearinghouse - Medicare Administrative Contractor (NSC-MAC) is the single organizational entity responsible for issuing or revoking Medicare supplier billing privileges for suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) and maintaining supplier files that contain information collected via the Medicare enrollment application (CMS 855S). The NSC-MAC was developed because of the unique and specialized requirements that distinguish DMEPOS supplier enrollment from that of other Medicare providers and suppliers. In particular this includes special licensing, insurance, inventory, etc. The unique standards that DMEPOS suppliers must meet are contained in 42 C.F.R. 424.57. The primary function of the NSC is to, at a minimum, 1) ensure that only qualified suppliers of Durable Medical equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) are enrolled or remain enrolled in the Medicare program; 2) take necessary actions to revoke enrolled suppliers who no longer meet supplier standards; 3) establish and maintain a fraud prevention and detection program; 4) process DMEPOS supplier enrollment applications and appeals in a timely manner; 5) participate in the development, testing, and transition/implementation/operation of the Provider Enrollment Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS) for DMEPOS suppliers; and 6) ensure that all DMEPOS suppliers are properly accredited. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a solicitation for the National Supplier Clearinghouse Medicare Administrative Contractor (NSC-MAC).
