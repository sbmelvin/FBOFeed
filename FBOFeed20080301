<DESC>NASA/DFRC intends to award a sole source contract for the acquisition of four (4) each seven (7) slot Versa Module Eurocard (VME) chassis with extra 3.3VDC 45 amps converter by CM Computer of Sevilla - Spain. Deliverables are anticiated approximately fourteen weeks from the effective date of the order (estimated to be issued on or about March 14, 2008).  The SOFIA program consists of an airborne observatory platform (a Boeing 747-SP aircraft) arrayed with a 2.5 meter infrared telescope, as well as other scientific instruments capable of infrared and sub millimeter observations.  The SOFIA observatory is being developed by NASA and its partner the DLR (German Aerospace Center).  The SOFIA observatory will be the world's largest and most sensitive airborne observatory.  The aircraft will operate at a ceiling of 45,000 feet. The telescope will look out of an open cavity in the side of the aircraft and allow astronomers to obtain sharper infrared images than ever before.  The estimated life of the operational program is 20 years.  NASA/DFRC intends to procure services from CM Computer of Sevilla-Spain. The authority for other than full and open competition is "only one responsible source, no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)." CM Computer is the only responsible source; they are the only vendor that can provide the chassis pre-configured to SOFIA specifications. As a result, CM Computer is uniquely qualified to provide the required chassis configuration. No equivalent computer can be obtained from any other source which meets the specific combination of requirements. Any other contractor, selected in a competitive procurement, would need to implement a design effort, adding six (6) to twelve (12) months to the delivery time in order to meet the below unique requirements of this procurement:  Item Description: 7 slot VME Chassis with extra 3.3 UDC 45 amps converter.  Part Number: CM-ATR-35/FAC/VME64x/90-264VAC/500W/CB3.3-150W/CMP/HTC/HBC/F115-65CFM/EMIG/B  Technical specifications:  a. 3/4 ATR, 7 Slot Chassis, Flowthrough Air Cooled, Military VME64x Backplane  b. 90-264VAC Input Power, 500 Watts Output Power, extra 3.3VDC 45 Amps DC/DC converter-6Uboard fitted and wired in backplane slot 7   c. Standard CM Front Panel, High Profile Top Cover, High Profile Bottom Cover  d. Fans fitted for 115 VAC 400 Hz, auto voltage and auto frequency through electronics converter box  e. EMI/EMC fingerguard  f. Chassis Color: Black  g. The entire assembly together shall be able to run off power sources from 90 - 264 VAC, 30 - 800 Hz.  h. Each chassis shall:   i. be delivered with a complete set of MIL-STD-461E and MIL-STD-810F certificates and detail testing reports issued by independent labs.  ii. be flight rated to NASA environmental test requirements,  iii. have single board processor capability for use with a VME backplane,  iv. have backplane w  ith low power requirements (DC/DC 3.3 VDC 6U card).  The NASA-HQ Science Mission Directorate (SMD) made a recommendation to restructure the SOFIA Program after the NASA Program Management Council review of the Program in 2006. The resultant schedule for early science, spring of 2009, is an agency requirement and has become critical to the success and continuation of the SOFIA program. Accurate configuration of the chassis and delivery, which includes vendor testing, qualifications and certifications, is a commercial acquisition through CM Computer. All other potential venders would need to meet this requirement through special design, precluding use of commercial procedures and making the agency requirement for early science unattainable.  CM Computer is highly specialized in military specifications for flight-system hardware design. The products are manufactured based on field-tested technology and offer commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) open architectures. These aspects are vital to this instant action, allowing for delivery of tested and certified chassis and COTS configuration, all of which are critical to the SOFIA early science schedule. Failure to acquire the chassis by June 24th will adversely impact other SOFIA tasks dependent on the chassis installation.  These reasons justify procuring the work exclusively from CM Computer.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. local time on March 10, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>A.	General Information

The Southwest & Pacific Regions, two of the three Regions that form the Logistical Support Area (LSA-West), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in California, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announce a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Casting & Splinting Supplies.  The regions recognize vendors may manufacture and/or distribute subsets of the category.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Regions and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Regions a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs? needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes casting tape, cast protectors, plasters, arm slings, stockinettes, padding, and splints used to set and/or immobilize abnormalities of the musculo-skeletal system.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit?s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in these Regions include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB, Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.   

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a 

contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is May 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s).  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Southwest and Pacific Regions are seeking product line items in the category of Casting & Splinting Supplies. The product category includes casting tape, cast protectors, plasters, arm slings, stockinettes, padding, and splints used to set and/or immobilize abnormalities of the musculo-skeletal system. Within these 2 Regions, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $310,000.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include Tape Cast ? various sizes; Splint ? various sizes & types; Undercast Padding ? various sizes; Stockinettes ? various sizes & types. 

At the request of the Southwest & Pacific Regions Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Vendors

If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil later than March 26, 2008.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed.  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:

Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN 
Tri-Service Regional Business Office

Phone: (808)433-7985

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is 
strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within the Southwest Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be 

requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria

Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls/alerts that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for central venous catheters and supplies including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  This represents your sole opportunity to present this information. Provide any mitigating factors that you may have in order to provide a proper context for the cited back orders, recalls, etc.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the ?break?, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria Evaluation
Cast Padding
1.	Provides comfort and protection to the skin to prevent injury to the skin.
2.	Provides minimal shifting with application to ensure it remains in place while the casting material is applied.
3.	The padding is water resistant at minimum to prevent skin breakdown from prolonged exposure to moisture.

Casting Tape (fiberglass/plaster)
1.	The tape is easy to apply and does not get sticky.
2.	The tape molds to the extremity without excessive gapping or bulging for a smooth application.
3.	The tape has a creamy texture and allows for a smooth finish to prevent sharp edges from being formed and potentially causing injury to the skin or surrounding area.
4.	The tape is comfortable to the extremity to prevent discomfort or pain.
5.	The chemical reaction does not create excessive heat to the extremity which can cause discomfort and potential skin injury.
6.	The strength is consistent to maintain the integrity of the finished cast.
7.	The casting tape can be easily cut with standard tools to avoid the need to purchase additional tools and to make application effortless.

Stockinette
1.	Provides comfort and protection to the skin.
2.	Provides minimal water retention to prevent skin breakdown from prolonged exposure to moisture.
3.	The stockinette is water resistant at a minimum to prevent skin breakdown from prolonged exposure to moisture.

Splints
1.	The splint is adequately padded to provide comfort to the affected area.
2.	The splint provides adequate support to maintain the proper alignment of the limb.

Phase III ? Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.
