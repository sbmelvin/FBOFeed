INTRODUCTION: The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) seeks concept papers that address technological innovations and/or process improvements that can be demonstrated to enhance our nation's ability to quickly deploy and sustain our warfighters by air, anywhere in the world. The AMB pursues innovation opportunities across the entire span of air mobility missions: Air Transportation (cargo and personnel), Air Drop, Air Refueling, Special Air Missions, Expeditionary Combat Support, and Aeromedical Evacuation. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraphs 35.016 and 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals. Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984." Responses shall reference Solicitation Number 1435-04-04-RP-32344. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL 30 SEP 04, AND CONCEPT PAPERS MAY BE SUBMITTED AT ANY TIME UP TO THAT DATE. A copy of this BAA is also posted on the World Wide Web at http://www.amwc.af.mil/wcb. There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic. B. OBJECTIVE: The AMB seeks ideas and solutions that reduce mobility response time and/or air mobility cost to the Department of Defense, reduce the deployable support structure, increase combat capability and effectiveness during deployment, and/or enable USAF members who support air mobility missions to do their jobs better, cheaper, and/or quicker. AMB'S PRIMARY FOCUS IS THE IDENTIFICATION, INVESTIGATION, AND DEMONSTRATION OF INNOVATIVE IDEAS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND CONCEPTS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF BEING FIELDED IN 18 MONTHS OR LESS. AMB seeks first to use contractor-loaned equipment or to participate in Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), but has limited funds available to contract for several demonstrations.  The AMB conducts operational demonstrations of innovative mobility concepts, evaluates their military worth, and presents its assessments to senior decision makers--frequently to the Commander of Air Mobility Command, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Transportation Command, and Chief of Staff of the USAF. CURRENTLY, HIGH INTEREST AREAS INCLUDE:  1.) Precision Airdrop 2.) Aircraft Survivability 3.) Aircraft Identification (Friend/Foe)  4.) Autonomous All-Weather Landings 5.) Next Generation Mobility Aircraft Concept 6.) Aeromedical Evacuation Interoperability 7.) Secure, Global Connectivity & Information 8.) Deployed/In-Garrison MAF Force Protection 9.) Improve Inter-Modal Ammunition Distribution 10.) Operations in Austere Environments 11.) Enhance Maintenance Effectiveness Via Computer Modeling 12.) Small, easily deployable material handling equipment (MHE).  However, this BAA solicits concept papers with the potential to enhance Air Force operations within any element of air mobility operations, or their interfaces with the rest of the Defense Transportation System (DTS). C. HOW TO RESPOND/ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: (1) DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME; ONLY CONCEPT PAPERS WILL BE EVALUATED. The purpose of the concept paper is to preclude effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. (2) Offerors are advised that only a warranted Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the government to an award under this BAA. (3) Security Requirements: every precaution must be taken to protect potentially sensitive or classified material. Such material should not be transmitted across open-source media like public telephone, fax, Internet, or email. If a submitter has any reason to suspect their concept may reference ideas or operations that require special protection, please contact Captain Brendan Burke at (609) 754-7938 prior to submission for additional guidance.  In general, potentially sensitive submissions should be sent via REGISTERED MAIL to the mailing address listed in Section D of this BAA.

(4) Successful offerors must comply with the Privacy Act, AFI 37-132. (5) Offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, if they have one. (6) Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the concept paper and any evaluations.

ABSTRACT:

The Munitions Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Eglin AFB FL is interested in revolutionary munitions-related research that has the potential to create new airframe/ordnance and guidance/control technology weapon paradigms.  One of the goals of this program is to develop highly innovative solutions relating to munitions ordnance packages and airframe technology for the purpose of defeating a variety of targets including fixed and moving targets, hard and soft targets, and above ground and deeply buried targets.  Ideas and concepts are sought that represent new approaches – lethal and non-lethal – to defeat these targets.  For example, dropping a 2000-pound bomb on a biological weapons factory represents a standard lethal approach to defeat the target.  Alternatively, an approach may be to detonate an acoustic energy warhead that neutralizes the biological agent within the facility.  This represents an innovative, non-lethal approach to the problem.  These are the types of concepts being sought, i.e., approaches and methodologies that are so innovative that they essentially represent new ordnance package and delivery system technology paradigms.  With this type of revolutionary thinking, as opposed to evolutionary incrementalism, order of magnitude increases in performance may be realized.  The military payoff would be in terms of significant munition weight and size reduction, reduced weapon cost, and improved effectiveness.  Non-lethal approaches also have the benefit of disabling enemy capabilities with reduced loss of life. 

Another goal of this program is to develop highly innovative concepts and approaches in guidance and control technologies for air-deliverable autonomous munitions.  This program may develop advanced concepts in such areas as electro-optical, infrared, millimeter wave, and radio frequency seeker technology with the components and signal/image processing systems used in such seekers. Advanced concepts in the guidance, navigation and control (GN&C) of munition airframes will also be sought.  Munitions airframes under consideration include air-to-air missiles, air-to-surface munitions (general purpose bombs and hard target penetrators), exointerceptors, submunitions, and projectiles.  The basic seeker technologies to be considered include:  sensing materials, sensing elements for target characterization, autonomous target acquisition algorithms, signal and image processing algorithms, and multi-sensor data fusion algorithms.  The basic GN&C technologies include: miniature inertial measurement units (IMUs), Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, jam resistant GPS, and micro-electro-mechanical system based sensing and control cooperative attack algorithms.  In addition to advancements in the basic technology, revolutionary changes that shift current or create new guidance and control paradigms will be developed.

Novel concepts such as ultra-light integration of GN&C, seeker, and warhead technologies will be considered.  Ideas and concepts such as smart skin (for sensing and controlling the ambient aerodynamic environment) and microelectromechanical systems (e.g., micro gyros and accelerometers) will be explored.  This radical type of technology has the potential to increase weapon performance by orders of magnitude over existing systems.  The technology developed under this program will support the far term goals of the Battle Space Access, Air Supremacy, Area Dominance, Hard Target Neutralization, Counter-proliferation, and Revolutionary Munition Integrating Concepts.  New integrating concepts evolving from the aforementioned ones center on munition technologies for close air support, urban combat, air expeditionary forces, counter-proliferation, and functional defeat of hardened targets.  The Munitions Directorate welcomes innovative research proposals in many different areas.  Some specific examples are given below:  (Please note that this list is not intended to be restrictive.  Proposals dealing with other areas of revolutionary munition ordnance or guidance technology will also be welcome.)

	- Target Location Methods

	- Multi-Mode Explosives

	- Integrated Guidance

	- Munition Speed/Maneuverability

	- Long Loiter

	- Munition Component Parts Reduction (Numbers/Size)

	- Networked Communication/Intelligence

	- Munition Knowledge (Artificial Intelligence)

- Multifunctional Damage Mechanisms
	
- Non-Lethal Technologies

            - Battle Damage Indication

- Munition Related Environmental Pollution Prevention

- Advanced Fuze Research


Also, as with the previous Broad Agency Announcement, the Munitions Directorate wishes to emphasize four specific technology topics.  Proposals describing innovative technologies that may have the potential to support one or more of these topics are particularly encouraged.

1.	Positron Energy Conversion and Advanced Energetics
2.	Micro Platforms
3.	Cooperative Attack
4.	Subterranean Platforms

Proposals should describe scientific study and experimentation to increase knowledge and understanding in these areas or other areas that may have the potential to provide paradigm-shifting technologies that could dramatically change the way the Air Force conducts future operations.


This Broad Agency Announcement consists of three parts (ATTACHMENT 1):

	PART I	Research Interests

	PART II	Proposal Evaluation

	PART III	Proposal Preparation

The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Companies responding to this announcement are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds.
This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes a solicitation for proposals under the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  The BAA describes research requirements and methods for preparing and submitting proposals.

<DESC>NA The USDOT/RSPA/Volpe Center intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Electric Research & Management, Inc. (ERM).  The purpose of negotiations is to reach an agreement on the techniques and cost for a survey and comparative analysis of electromagnetic fields and radiation associated with the Intercity Express (ICE) rail system in Germany.  Electric Research & Management, Inc. (ERM) owns and uses MultiWave Equipment and MWAVE data analysis software.  These products are necessary to perform the survey and analysis and are the exclusive, trademarked products of ERM.  The MultiWave Equipment and MWAVE data analysis software meet current Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) testing and analysis protocols. Government market research indicates that ERM is the only entity capable of meetin g established FRA survey protocols for electromagnetic fields and radiation associated with the ICE.  The USDOT therefore intends to negotiate with ERM on a sole source basis.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  Persons and entities interested in this procurement and which believe themselves capable of performing, may submit a statement of capability and qualification.  Statements of capability and qualification must be submitted in writing to the identified Original Point of Contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 11/7/2003.  Such statements must demonstrate: (1) Knowledge and ability to perform a survey and comparative analysis in accordance with established Federal Railroad Administra tion (FRA) protocols for electromagnetic fields and radiation associated with the ICE; (2) Familiarity with and ability to use existing electromagnetic field databases for preparing the comparative analysis; and (3) Knowledge of applicable human exposure safety standards (e.g., WHO/ICNIRP, FCC and German government).  Statements of capability and qualification will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>21 CONS/LGCZ, Air Force Space Command, intends to offer the privatization of the electrical, water, and wastewater infrastructure system at Clear Air Force Station, Alaska.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, if privatized, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s).  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the Government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s).  The contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain, and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The operation and maintenance contract(s) will be governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  Transfers of property and grants of access are authorized by 10 U.S.C. § 2688.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP and grants access to the system(s).  Transfer of title to the utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale after meeting the licensing and permit requirements of the contract.   Past Performance information from potential offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  The utility systems being privatized are described as follows:  Clear Air Force Station, Alaska, electric, water, and wastewater utility systems support a base population of approximately 251 people.  Clear is comprised of approximately 11,438 acres (350 acres developed), and 59 buildings consisting of 870,623 square feet. Electrical power is generated by the government-owned Central Heating and Power Plant (CH/PP) and is the only electricity source for Clear AFS.  THE PLANT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRIVATIZATION EFFORT.  The CH/PP has three coal-fired boilers.  Each boiler was designed to operate at 625psig and 825°F, with three 7.5-megawatt General Electric (G.E.) steam turbine generators and one 1.0-megawatt diesel engine generator.  The CH/PP produces power at 4160 volts wye with an ungrounded neutral.  Primary power is distributed throughout the site through overhead three phase circuits consisting of approximately 29,000 feet of 1950’s vintage #1/0 ACSR.  In addition, there exist roughly 136,000 circuit feet of insulated conductor and 96 single and three phase transformers ranging in size from 5 to 1000 kVA.  The need to run the plant for steam heat results in the production of more electricity in winter than the station requires, and a load bank has been installed to absorb the excess.  The annual electric energy usage for this facility is roughly 75,480,000 kWH with a peak demand of approximately 10,993 kW occurring during the fall months.  These numbers include the CH/PP station loads.  The water distribution system consists of on-base groundwater supply wells, chlorination system, water supply pumps, and the piping distribution system.  The main potable water supply well pump has a 250gpm capacity.  Fire protection water supply pumps include two wells with 1,000gpm water supply pumps and a 1,500 gallons hydro pneumatic tank.  The water distribution piping system includes approximately 25,000 feet of 4-inch to 8-inch water main piping.  Water production flow averages approximately 150,000 gallons per day.  The wastewater collection system is treated for primary solids removal, and discharged to an on-base leach field system.  The collection piping includes approximately 14,000 feet of 6-inch to 10-inch mains and one lift station.  The primary treatment facilities include a commutator, Imhoff clarifier, and sewage sludge drying bed.  Dried sludge is hauled once a year to a nearby landfill.  Clarified effluent flows to a 26,136 square feet leach field.  The collection system was mostly constructed in the 1960s.  The treatment system was refurbished in 1992.  The leach field was constructed in 1997.  Wastewater flow averages approximately 150,000 gallons per day.  The successful offeror or offerors will be required to comply with all service distribution requirements outlined in the solicitation, to obtain all applicable permits, licenses and certifications necessary for performance, to possess the financial resources necessary to provide operation and maintenance of the utility distribution system or systems, and to possess the financial resources required for capital improvements. The points of contacts are: Ms. Jean Goforth, Contracting Officer, Phone (719) 556-9356; e-mail jean.goforth@peterson.af.mil or Ms. Diane Stout, Contracting Specialist, Phone (719) 554-2840; Fax (719) 554-2744, e-mail diane.stout@peterson.af.mil e-mail is the preferred method of contact.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization in cooperation with the White House Communications Agency (WHCA) intends to award, though limited competition (under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)), a fixed-firm price contract to a single vendor to provide temporary telecommunications services in support of the White House travel mission.  After extensive market research and analysis of WHCA travel records going back to 1998, the Government has developed a list of vendors that meet the required experience, past performance record, existing telecom service agreements and market presence to guarantee successful support of this critical requirement.  AT&T, Bell South, CenturyTel, Southwestern Bell/SBC, Sprint, QWest and Verizon are the only vendors that will be allowed to submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  This contract will be used to provide temporary telecommunications services in support of the President of the United States, Vice President of the United States, First Lady of the United States, White House Special Missions, and White House Communications Agency travel requirements.  Competition will be limited to the previously identified vendors having significant prior experience with the White House travel mission and enough market presence to be able to provide extensive connectivity averaging in excess of a hundred temporary lines in dozens of locations on very short notice (typically 72 hours or less).  Each trip site must be supported exactly as required (in terms of schedule and types of service required) to ensure the Commander in Chief  (CINC) is connected to the national security structure 100% of the time with exactly the capabilities required by WHCA.  It is absolutely vital the company selected has the capabilities, experience and resources to instantly react to the rapidly changing requirements of the CINC and members of the national security staff.  The contractor will be responsible for all aspects of provisioning all required communications between the locations identified in every order including, but not necessarily limited to, installation of drops, pulling of cable, provisioning of local and long distance service, installation and provisioning of ISDN-P & B for switched data, voice, video and VTC, installation of trunks, provisioning of international direct dialing and VPN.  Government personnel will operate the equipment employed.  All personnel having access to summary data about trip provisioning (access to the full list of trips and services) must have at least a SECRET security clearance.  Numbered note 22 applies to this solicitation.  POC for this acquisition is Stephen Sprenger, 618-229-9408, Email: Sprenges@Scott.Disa.Mil

<DESC>53 NSNs – Silver Brazing Alloy, Copper Brazing Alloy, Brazing Flux, Soldering Flux, Lead Alloy Solder, Tin Alloy Solder, and Electric Soldering Iron.
	 
The purpose of this solicitation is to provide worldwide support for the National Stock Numbers (NSNs) listed in Attachment 1.  The NSNs are from the 3439 FSC, and 332811, 332812, 332813 NAICS.  The NSNs will be evaluated on a line by line basis and multiple contracts may be awarded.  Contractors may quote on as many NSNs as they have the capability to perform. The contract(s) awarded will be Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract(s).  The solicitation contains a two-year base period with three one-year option periods. The NSNs on this solicitation were chosen based on the World Wide Web Industrial Capabilities Assessment Program (WICAP).  WICAP uses the Department of Commerce’s North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), which is based on similar manufacturing processes. The NSNs listed in Attachment 1 identify the items to be included in this solicitation.

The contractor shall function as a source of supply for the NSNs on this contract to consistently deliver parts to the DLA Depots.  Delivery Orders will be issued to the contractor through the Paperless Ordering Placement System (POPs). The contractor shall interface with DoD Information Systems in an Electronic Commerce/ Electronic Data Interchange (EC/EDI) environment as specified in section titled ‘System Interface and Integration’ below.  On an exception basis, manual delivery orders may be issued for these items. 

Pricing:  The Contractor is to provide pricing for the base period and option periods. Attachment 1 identifies the NSNs, and estimated demand quantities for the base period and option periods.  Please provide contractor pricing on this spreadsheet.  Contractors are encouraged to consider minimum order quantities (MOQ) when setting prices.  Contractors are not required to honor orders for quantities less than the MOQ [see clause I67, 52.216.19].  However, it is important to note that offers will be evaluated based on the estimated annual demand quantity (ADQ) [see clause M12, 52.216-9G09].  These numbers are based on the best projection available at the time of this solicitation and are subject to change.  Some of the NSNs may have ADQs of zero; however, these NSNs may not necessarily have zero demands.  They may, in fact, be items recently assigned to DSCR, or items for which historical data is otherwise incomplete or unavailable, or items for which the Government has no recurring demands and therefore, cannot forecast any realistic estimates.  Offerors are encouraged to submit offers consistent with quantities reflected in their own historical data where available. 

For evaluation purposes, each individual NSN will be evaluated by multiplying the proposed unit price times the ADQ to arrive at the estimated total for each NSN.  In those cases where the annual demand quantity is zero, the government will use (1) to represent the quantity. 





I71, 52.216-22, Indefinite Quantity:  The minimum contract value is defined as the guaranteed monetary value of the aggregate orders issued during the base period only.   The minimum will not guarantee orders for any particular item or group of items.  The Government will not guarantee a minimum for the option periods.  The Government will compute a different minimum for each contract awarded under this solicitation in accordance with the following formula:  

10% of the aggregate extended dollar value of the minimum order quantity (MOQ) for the NSNs, computed as follows: 

0.1 x ([NSN1 price x MOQ] +  [NSN2 price x MOQ] +  etc…).

The maximum contract value is defined as: 

150% of the aggregate extended dollar value of the estimated value for the base period or each option period.  

Delivery:  The contractor shall deliver to the DLA distribution depot as designated on each DO.  The contractor shall ship ordered items on or before the required contract delivery date specified in the DO.  The required delivery date for each NSN is indicated in Attachment 1.

Delivery shall be FOB destination. The Contractor shall consolidate shipments from the same source to the same destination whenever possible. 

Surge and Sustainment: Surge and Sustainment NSNs are identified in Attachment 2. Surge and Sustainment requirements are outlined in clauses 52.217-9G25 and 252.217-9006 in Section I, in instruction 52.217-9G26 in Section L, and in 52.217-9G27 in Section M. In the attachment, the individual quantity requirements for each month are identified as well as the total six-month requirement per NSN. ‘Surge Support’ is one of the evaluation factors; therefore, offerors are required to comply with the specific clauses/provisions.

CLIN 6000 – Surge and Sustainment Requirement. Notice to Offerors: Clin 6000 is the surge quantity that may be ordered by the Government in a military contingency. The Government is not obligated to order any of the surge quantities and the contractor should not ship such quantities without receipt of an order clearly designated for surge quantities. The surge quantity requirements are identified at Attachment #2. The offeror must specify the percentage of price increase for surge quantities or state ‘none’. If the offeror fails to do so, the offeror will be evaluated with no additional charge for surge quantities.

		Surge Support 	Plus ___________%

Investment costs: Investment costs, if any, to execute the surge plan otherwise state ‘none’. Reference Clause 52.217-9G25, 252.217-9006 and 52.217-9G26

					$___________

Packaging Requirements: Higher-level packaging requirements in accordance with MIL-STD-2073 apply. All items shall be marked in accordance with MIL-STD 129. The contractor is required to package material in accordance with Quantity Unit Pack (QUP) specified in MIL- STD-2073 and the Unit of Issue (UI) specified in each DO.

Quality: The contractor shall establish, implement, document and maintain a quality system that ensures conformance to all contractual requirements and meets the requirements of ISO 9001:2000. However, the contractor may propose an equivalent quality system model. If the contractor chooses to propose an equivalent quality, the clause in E5 – 52.246-11 – Higher Level Quality Requirements must be completed.

NSNs that require origin inspection are coded 1 or 2 in the PIC field of the Quality Matrix (Attachment 3).  NSNs that require destination inspection are coded 2 in the PIC field.  Quality Assurance Provisions for each NSN also appear in Attachment 3. 

Access to Technical Data Packages: Items shall be manufactured in accordance with Government technical data packages and drawings. The contractor may obtain technical data packages using the following website: http://www.dscr.dla.mil/tdmd.
Contractors must have a membership number to access technical data. Contractors must follow the instructions provided on this website to obtain a membership number and technical data.

The Contractor is responsible for notifying the Government if the drawings or technical data is different from the information cited in the Acquisition Item Description (AID). Attachment 4 includes item descriptions obtained from the Contract Technical Data File (CTDF).

System Interface and Integration: In accordance with Clause52.211-9G33-POPS- Computer Compatibility, the contractor shall establish interface capability with DLA’s Standard Automated Material Management System (SAMMS) and Defense Automated Addressing System (DAAS). These interfaces will be for purposes of sending and receiving EC/EDI transmissions, electronic invoices and/or receipt transactions processing, and establishing two-way communication for logistics and management information. The Contractor shall ensure adequate systems interfaces are used to integrate commercial systems with Government systems for the entire logistics trail.

The following three EDI transactions are required for the purposes of transmitting the DOs and Tracking Performance:

		850 Purchase/Delivery Order
		856 Shipment Notice Manifest
		997 Functional Acknowledgment

The Purchase/ Delivery Order (850) will be processed through Defense Supply Center Richmond. The Functional Acknowledgement (997) will show that the contractor has received the delivery order and will establish the order issue date. The Shipment Notice (856) will identify the order shipment date of the total quantity. The functional acknowledgement and shipment notice will be used to track performance metrics. DSCR will utilize the Enterprise Linked Logistics Information Source (ELLIS), a performance metrics-tracking program, to measure contractor’s performance.

Please contact the contract specialist below for a listing of the NSNs.

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is seeking proposals from U.S. Contractors.  The opening date for the Request for Proposal is November 11, 2003 and the closing date is November 26, 2003.

The United States Trade and Development Agency (hereinafter “USTDA” or the “Government”) is considering the provision of grant funds for a multi-sector feasibility study in the Madagascar.  The objective of this contract is to secure advisory and assistance services in determining whether to fund a feasibility study(s) or any alternative activities that the Contractor sees as a viable option for USTDA consideration.  This means the Contractor’s recommendation will take into consideration the entire range of USTDA program capabilities, such as alternative technical assistance, orientation visits, or training grants. USTDA’s website, www.tda.gov may be used as a resource tool.  To specifically meet the objective, the Contractor shall provide expert analysis on:  potential risks of the proposed project; potential exports of U.S. equipment and services that could be utilized in project implementation; and priority of the proposed project to the host country.  The Contractor shall provide a final report to USTDA.  The Contractor shall use a project life cycle approach in formulating recommendations, analysis of the issues and a recommendation on whether USTDA should fund a study or studies on the project(s).  All recommendations to fund a study shall include a complete budget and terms of reference.

USTDA has received expressions of interest for feasibility funding for projects in the energy, transportation, and mining/natural resources sectors in Madagascar from both the Government of Madagascar and from the local private sector.  USTDA staff visited Madagascar to conduct an initial review of proposed projects and has narrowed its interest to one or two strong projects in each of the above sectors.  The selected Definitional Mission team will be expected to review each of these projects and others in country to make a recommendation to USTDA for feasibility funding.  

It is expected that the DM team will travel between the end of November 2003 and the end of December 2003.  The Contractor should plan for a significant amount of travel in Madagascar.  The DM team will be expected to communicate with USTDA officers in Washington, DC, and Johannesburg, South Africa, on a regular basis.

USTDA in Madagascar (Potential Projects) – TRANSPORTATION:  Project No.1 - Pangalanes Canal / Port of Manakara - Constructed by the French in early 1900s to create a safe inland waterway along Malagasy east coast, to offset treacherous Indian Ocean conditions for improved maritime navigation.  Upgraded with inland port facilities, dredging by African Development bank during 1980s. Lack of continual dredging has limited effective capacity of canal.  If dredging program and capital improvements were implemented, canal would open multimodal transport, cabotage and trade possibilities between Fianarantsoa –Manakara (via the FCE Railway, to be concessioned) and Manakara – Tamatave (largest Malagasy port via the canal).  The primary financier of the upgrade would be revenue gained from fossil fuels transport, but also local agricultural producers along the canal.  A feasibility study needs to focus on two distinct issues: a) The section of the Canal from Tamatave to Manajary that has already been opened up in the past to barge traffic; b) the section from Manajary to Manakara that is not at present wide enough to sustain barge traffic. The feasibility study must consider the Canal de Pangalane as a uniform entity from Tamatave to Manakara, but technical and economic issues vary between the two sections.   Project No. 2-Ft. Dauphin (Taolanaro) Port – The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is working with QMM (Rio Tinto’s ilmenite development) to develop a new, major deepwater port to handle the mineral export and local trade needs for southeastern Madagascar.  A $70 million Public Private Partnership (PPP) development, it appears that IFC and QMM will come to terms with the government for financing.  Likely not a USTDA interest, unless the parties come back and request additional assistance in design and financial structuring.   Project No. 3-Mahajanga Port- A new port is planned for north of Mahajanga, a major industrial city on the west coast.  
Project No. 4-Diego (Antsiranana) Port - Local industry – fishing and vanilla – as well as a co-located shipyard, require port improvements.  French government is financing road and port upgrades.  Project No. 5 -Tulear Port - Rehabilitation design work already completed under World Bank program.  Minimal quay rehab and port extension work envisaged.  Government needs to commit resources or line up private equity.  Likely not large enough for USTDA interest.  Project No. 6 - Tamatave Port – This project is presently being concessioned with IFC consulting.  Need to expand/rehabilitate infrastructure, improve efficiency.  Several shipping lines will bid for container terminal concession.  No current USTDA prospects.  Project No. 7-Ivato Airport - Several plans proposed, including new passenger terminal, new cargo terminal, new highway to connect airport with Tananarive and/or a new convention center.  While some re-structuring of airport facilities is necessary (particularly cargo), it appears that Ivato is right-sized for current passenger/cargo throughput.  Likely no USTDA potential.
POWER - Hydropower is a high priority of the government, given the prohibitive high cost of thermal power generation Madagascar experiences today.  Project No. 8-20 MW HPP (near Ft. Dauphin) - QMM will require 10-12 MW when production begins in 2009.  It would guarantee offtake.  Remainder of power could be sold to local industrial/residential consumers, as Ft. Dauphin is not connected to national grid.  No known pre-Feasibility Study (FS) work to date.  Site on Mandrare or Marianara River.  IFC suggest a wind/solar supplement could be a useful co-renewable add-on to existing thermal facility.  Ministry rather is focusing solely on hydro solution.  Project No.9-60-70 MW HPP (to supply Muramanga) -Presently, considered under EDF (French company) pre-FS concluded 2003.  Ferro-chrome industry and possible Phelps-Dodge nickel mine would require 50-60 MW of power by 2010.  With transmission extension, could be easily connected to main highlands backbone power grid.  Three sites have been analyzed for construction – Lohavanna, Volobe, Ranomafana.   Project No. 10-40 MW HPP (near Mahajanga) - Several sites have been analyzed for a HPP to supply Mahajanga with power.  Facility lacks an obvious industrial guarantor, but power could serve municipality and regional sugar processing.  USTDA conducted feasibility study in 1986 on Ambodiroka site.  DM needs to review that report and determine applicability to current strategy.   Project No. 11-Bagasse Power Projects (facility near Ambanja) - The power unit could require upgrading; bagasse could be extended to its three other facilities.  NATURAL RESOURCES – Project No. 12-Moramanga Nickel Mining - USTDA expects to receive a request from Phelps Dodge/Dynatec for a final feasibility study on its 40,000 tpa nickel mining development near Moramanga that is slated for commissioning in 2010.   Project No. 13-Ferro-chrome - USTDA conducted a feasibility study for a facility rehab near Moramanga in 1996.  Minister of Mines and Energy requests re-consideration of this project, as well as additional mining opportunities in the sector.  Key question for new mining ventures is the amount of preliminary geology that has been done.  Project No. 14-Graphite - Similar to Ferro-chrome, Minister of Mines and Energy has requested that USTDA consider the possibility of developing projects where some preliminary geology is available.  The French founded and have dominated the sector since the building of the FCE Railway in the early 1900s.  Today, 3 French firms operate facilities, though minimal capital has been invested in recent years.  New sites could be developed.   Project No. 15-Sugar - Sirama, the state sugar company, is undergoing privatization and rehabilitation.  Madagascar produces 40,000 tpa of sugar, despite capacity to produce 120,000 tpa.  It was unable to make use of its valuable U.S. sugar quota last year.  Mauritian firms have expressed the greatest interest, having already invested $3 million in rehabilitation projects in advance of the privatization.  

The estimated cost for this work does not exceed $40,000.

USTDA, located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, promotes American private sector participation in developing and middle-income countries, with special emphasis on economic sectors that represent significant U.S. export potential. Through the funding of feasibility studies, orientation visits, specialized training grants, business workshops, and various forms of technical assistance, we help U.S. businesses compete for infrastructure projects in emerging markets.  We assist in building mutually beneficial partnerships between American companies and overseas project sponsors that result in increased U.S. exports and jobs, and the completion of high quality, successful projects in host countries.  

The Small Business Act, at 15, U.S.C. 252, authorizes procuring agencies to aside procurements or portions of procurements for the exclusive participation of Small Businesses Concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 541330.

Definition: “Small business concerns” for purposes of USTDA award of this total set aside contract means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operating for which it is bidding.  In determining whether dominance exists for USTDA’s purpose for this contract, consideration is given to annual gross receipts.  Any concern that is annual gross receipts above $5 million dollars, averaged over a three year period, is not considered small and is therefore, NOT eligible for award under this contract.

All participating organizations involved with supplying professional services must be incorporated or chartered in the United States.  Consultants planning teaming arrangements must be U.S. citizens or resident aliens.  In accordance with FAR 19.301, offerors will be required to submit self-certification relating to business size.  The competitive proposals method of solicitation as set forth in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1) shall be utilized for this procurement.  The solicitation does not obligate USTDA to award a contract, nor does it commit USTDA to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal.  Any explanation desired by an offeror regarding the meaning or interpretation of this solicitation must be requested in writing and with sufficient time allowed for reply to reach the offerors before submission of their offerors.  All oral explanations or instruction, given before award of this contract will not be binding.  Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning the solicitation will be furnished promptly to all prospective offerors as an amendment of the solicitation, if such information is necessary to offerors submitting proposals or if lack of such information would be prejudicial to uninformed offerors.

The contractor must be in the position to present fair and unbiased information pursuant to the statement of work. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on/about (15) fifteen days after the publication date of this synopsis.   The RFP opening date is NOVEMBER 11, 2003 and the closing date is NOVEMBER 26, 2003.  Only written requests for the RFP that indicate the company’s size will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

QUESTIONS and ANSWERS PERTAINING TO
        REQUEST FOR QUOTATION
               03L000003

Title: HHS Uiversity Academic Partnerships

1.Question: Are you looking for one entity that could offer all
            types of courses, on site classroom , e-learning,
            telecourses? Or could a proposal be submitted for 
            just one type of course, for instance ,e-learning?
  Answer:   A proposal could be submitted for one type of access, but we are hoping the contractor can provide various means of access to their coursework, in order to maximize the benefit to HHS employees nationwide.
2.Question: What does a firm–fixed price inclusive of all
charges for all sites mean? Does a firm-fixed unit price inclusive of all charges include software costs, admission fee and course material costs?
  Answer:  Additional fees for books and materials is expected, but firm fixed price applies to the per credit rate for courses. The rate should be constant for all HHS employees, regardless of duty station or place of residence.  
3.Question: What is the “unit cost”? Semester Credit Hour? 
            Quarter Credit Hour? Per Course?
Answer: Unit cost is a semester credit hour.
4.Question:  How many on-site , e-learning, or telecourses can
             be offered? Can a universities complete catalog be 
Answer:  There is no limit on the amount of courses offered.  Universities can offer their complete catalog in the proposal.
5.Question:  How much detail would you like provided on the 
             individual courses proposed?
  Answer:  As long as the contractor already provides catalogs, program guides or other print media that describes its courses, there is no need to provide detail at the individual course level.
6.Question:  Do you want information on every course in a 
            program?  For instance there may be 40 courses in a
            baccalaureate degree program.  Do want information 
            and pricing on each course or information on the 
            degree program?

  Answer: No, there is no need to cover every course in a program, as long as the contractor already provides catalogs, program guides or other print media that describes its courses in sufficient detail. Pricing should be presented in a per credit basis.  General information should cover types of programs, certificate or degrees.  There is no need to provide information on every course.
7.Question:  What is the suggested format and maximum length 
             for proposal responses?
  Answer:  The technical proposal should be no longer than 20 pages and should address the contractor’s ability to meet the requirements.  The business proposal shall provide the cost information for courses on a per credit hour basis and any separate costs that may be course specific materials or resources.  
8.Question:  What are your evaluation expectations at both the 
           course and partnership levels?
Answer:   There are no specific course level evaluation expectations, other than compliance to any terms a potential contractor intends to submit in the proposal. The partnership evaluation expectations are based on the actual accessibility and utilization of the contractor’s services.
9.Questions: Most State Universities do not supply books and 
           materials with courses.  These are purchased by the
           student from a designated vendor.  Would this system 
           of supplying books, workbooks, and other materials 
           required for the course be acceptable?
  Answer: Yes.
10.Questions: Can fees (such as for information technology) be
              excluded in the course cost?
  Answer: If “information technology” is defined as a course specific material or resource, then it can be a separate cost, passed to the student.
11.Questions: Some courses have pre-requisites.  Can these 
              courses be included. Who will establish that the
              student meets the pre-requisite.
  Answer:  Yes.  Completion of the pre-requisite is the responsibility of the contractor.
12.Questions: Can travel for on-site programs be billed as 
              incurred?
  Answer:  All costs (except books and other course specific materials) should be included in the per credit rate for the course.
13.Questions: In what format should we communicate course 
              information such as length of time & class size
              minimums/maximums?
  Answer:  Existing electronic or print material can be sent to HHS upon award of the contract.
14.Questions: You refer to both a “technical proposal” and a 
              “business proposal” in the announcement.  Are 
               these one in the same?
  Answer: No.  Reference answer to question number 7. The technical proposal shall not include price information.  
15.Questions: Please define and provide examples of 
             “telecourses”.  Would these include video-
              conference delivered courses?
  Answer: Telecourses would cover alternative types of distance learning.  Video conferencing would be included in telecourses.
16.Questions: Please define and provide examples of the content
              you seek in the “technical approach” section of
              the proposal.
  Answer: The technical proposal shall be written in sufficient detail to clearly and conscisely demonstrate the contractor’s ability to provide the services required and explain how the project will be organized, staffed and managed.
17.Questions: In your statement “one tuition rate for all HHS 
              employees”, are you referring to charging one rate 
              to all people regardless of location, etc. or are 
              you seeking the same tuition rate for all courses?
  Answer:  One rate to all HHS employees, regardless of location.
18.Questions: Are you seeking both credit and non-credit
              courses?
  Answer: Ideally, credit courses are preferred, but non-credit courses can be presented.
19.Questions: Are you seeking both graduate and undergraduate
              courses?
  Answer: Yes
20.Questions: Please define what you mean by “accredited 
              academic courses”?
       
  Answer:  Courses that are accredited by an organization that is recognized by the US Department of Education.
21.Questions: What is your definition of a “certificate
              program”?
  Answer:  A series of courses focused in one area of study.
22.Questions: Relative to on-site delivered courses, do you 
              expect the university partner to identify the 
              physical facilities used for these deliveries and 
              make the logistical arrangements with these 
              facilities for delivery of these programs?
             
  Answer:  Yes
23.Questions: Can we add new program offerings as they are 
              developed?
  Answer: Yes
24.Questions: Will we have an opportunity to modify prices in 
              future option periods?
  Answer: Yes
25.Questions: What expectations does HHS have for the
              recuperation of facilities and administrative 
              costs?

  Answer: There are no expectations of administrative costs and recuperation of facilities to be passed on to HHS.  All costs for coursework (except for books and other course-specific materials) should be included in the per credit cost.

26.Questions: Can the course offerings be expanded and or 
              modified during a project period or in subsequent 
              project periods?
  Answer Yes
26.Questions: If a student does not complete a course does the 
              accredited institution return all, part or none of
              the course fee?
  Answer  Once enrolled in a course, the student abides by the rules of the institution; and must adhere to its refund policies.

<DESC>53 NSNs – Silver Brazing Alloy, Copper Brazing Alloy, Brazing Flux, Soldering Flux, Lead Alloy Solder, Tin Alloy Solder, and Electric Soldering Iron.
	 
The purpose of this solicitation is to provide worldwide support for the National Stock Numbers (NSNs) listed in Attachment 1.  The NSNs are from the 3439 FSC, and 332811, 332812, 332813 NAICS.  The NSNs will be evaluated on a line by line basis and multiple contracts may be awarded.  Contractors may quote on as many NSNs as they have the capability to perform. The contract(s) awarded will be Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract(s).  The solicitation contains a two-year base period with three one-year option periods. The NSNs on this solicitation were chosen based on the World Wide Web Industrial Capabilities Assessment Program (WICAP).  WICAP uses the Department of Commerce’s North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), which is based on similar manufacturing processes. The NSNs listed in Attachment 1 identify the items to be included in this solicitation.

The contractor shall function as a source of supply for the NSNs on this contract to consistently deliver parts to the DLA Depots.  Delivery Orders will be issued to the contractor through the Paperless Ordering Placement System (POPs). The contractor shall interface with DoD Information Systems in an Electronic Commerce/ Electronic Data Interchange (EC/EDI) environment as specified in section titled ‘System Interface and Integration’ below.  On an exception basis, manual delivery orders may be issued for these items. 

Pricing:  The Contractor is to provide pricing for the base period and option periods. Attachment 1 identifies the NSNs, and estimated demand quantities for the base period and option periods.  Please provide contractor pricing on this spreadsheet.  Contractors are encouraged to consider minimum order quantities (MOQ) when setting prices.  Contractors are not required to honor orders for quantities less than the MOQ [see clause I67, 52.216.19].  However, it is important to note that offers will be evaluated based on the estimated annual demand quantity (ADQ) [see clause M12, 52.216-9G09].  These numbers are based on the best projection available at the time of this solicitation and are subject to change.  Some of the NSNs may have ADQs of zero; however, these NSNs may not necessarily have zero demands.  They may, in fact, be items recently assigned to DSCR, or items for which historical data is otherwise incomplete or unavailable, or items for which the Government has no recurring demands and therefore, cannot forecast any realistic estimates.  Offerors are encouraged to submit offers consistent with quantities reflected in their own historical data where available. 

For evaluation purposes, each individual NSN will be evaluated by multiplying the proposed unit price times the ADQ to arrive at the estimated total for each NSN.  In those cases where the annual demand quantity is zero, the government will use (1) to represent the quantity. 





I71, 52.216-22, Indefinite Quantity:  The minimum contract value is defined as the guaranteed monetary value of the aggregate orders issued during the base period only.   The minimum will not guarantee orders for any particular item or group of items.  The Government will not guarantee a minimum for the option periods.  The Government will compute a different minimum for each contract awarded under this solicitation in accordance with the following formula:  

10% of the aggregate extended dollar value of the minimum order quantity (MOQ) for the NSNs, computed as follows: 

0.1 x ([NSN1 price x MOQ] +  [NSN2 price x MOQ] +  etc…).

The maximum contract value is defined as: 

150% of the aggregate extended dollar value of the estimated value for the base period or each option period.  

Delivery:  The contractor shall deliver to the DLA distribution depot as designated on each DO.  The contractor shall ship ordered items on or before the required contract delivery date specified in the DO.  The required delivery date for each NSN is indicated in Attachment 1.

Delivery shall be FOB destination. The Contractor shall consolidate shipments from the same source to the same destination whenever possible. 

Surge and Sustainment: Surge and Sustainment NSNs are identified in Attachment 2. Surge and Sustainment requirements are outlined in clauses 52.217-9G25 and 252.217-9006 in Section I, in instruction 52.217-9G26 in Section L, and in 52.217-9G27 in Section M. In the attachment, the individual quantity requirements for each month are identified as well as the total six-month requirement per NSN. ‘Surge Support’ is one of the evaluation factors; therefore, offerors are required to comply with the specific clauses/provisions.

CLIN 6000 – Surge and Sustainment Requirement. Notice to Offerors: Clin 6000 is the surge quantity that may be ordered by the Government in a military contingency. The Government is not obligated to order any of the surge quantities and the contractor should not ship such quantities without receipt of an order clearly designated for surge quantities. The surge quantity requirements are identified at Attachment #2. The offeror must specify the percentage of price increase for surge quantities or state ‘none’. If the offeror fails to do so, the offeror will be evaluated with no additional charge for surge quantities.

		Surge Support 	Plus ___________%

Investment costs: Investment costs, if any, to execute the surge plan otherwise state ‘none’. Reference Clause 52.217-9G25, 252.217-9006 and 52.217-9G26

					$___________

Packaging Requirements: Higher-level packaging requirements in accordance with MIL-STD-2073 apply. All items shall be marked in accordance with MIL-STD 129. The contractor is required to package material in accordance with Quantity Unit Pack (QUP) specified in MIL- STD-2073 and the Unit of Issue (UI) specified in each DO.

Quality: The contractor shall establish, implement, document and maintain a quality system that ensures conformance to all contractual requirements and meets the requirements of ISO 9001:2000. However, the contractor may propose an equivalent quality system model. If the contractor chooses to propose an equivalent quality, the clause in E5 – 52.246-11 – Higher Level Quality Requirements must be completed.

NSNs that require origin inspection are coded 1 or 2 in the PIC field of the Quality Matrix (Attachment 3).  NSNs that require destination inspection are coded 2 in the PIC field.  Quality Assurance Provisions for each NSN also appear in Attachment 3. 

Access to Technical Data Packages: Items shall be manufactured in accordance with Government technical data packages and drawings. The contractor may obtain technical data packages using the following website: http://www.dscr.dla.mil/tdmd.
Contractors must have a membership number to access technical data. Contractors must follow the instructions provided on this website to obtain a membership number and technical data.

The Contractor is responsible for notifying the Government if the drawings or technical data is different from the information cited in the Acquisition Item Description (AID). Attachment 4 includes item descriptions obtained from the Contract Technical Data File (CTDF).

System Interface and Integration: In accordance with Clause52.211-9G33-POPS- Computer Compatibility, the contractor shall establish interface capability with DLA’s Standard Automated Material Management System (SAMMS) and Defense Automated Addressing System (DAAS). These interfaces will be for purposes of sending and receiving EC/EDI transmissions, electronic invoices and/or receipt transactions processing, and establishing two-way communication for logistics and management information. The Contractor shall ensure adequate systems interfaces are used to integrate commercial systems with Government systems for the entire logistics trail.

The following three EDI transactions are required for the purposes of transmitting the DOs and Tracking Performance:

		850 Purchase/Delivery Order
		856 Shipment Notice Manifest
		997 Functional Acknowledgment

The Purchase/ Delivery Order (850) will be processed through Defense Supply Center Richmond. The Functional Acknowledgement (997) will show that the contractor has received the delivery order and will establish the order issue date. The Shipment Notice (856) will identify the order shipment date of the total quantity. The functional acknowledgement and shipment notice will be used to track performance metrics. DSCR will utilize the Enterprise Linked Logistics Information Source (ELLIS), a performance metrics-tracking program, to measure contractor’s performance.

Please contact the contract specialist below for a listing of the NSNs.

<DESC>Veterans Affairs Nursing Outcome Database (VANOD) Development and Support  RE: NAIC Code 541611 The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to the California Nursing Outcome Coalition (CalNOC).

Consultation will be about ongoing training, site support, sample report generation, establishment and membership on an advisory committee and published data for comparison.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties with the capability to provide the required services should submit a capability statement to Iris Redmon-Johnson,  mailto:Iris.Redmon-Johnson@mail.va.gov, phone number (202) 273-8827.

<SUBJECT>A -- Rapid Cure Coatings For Shipboard Ballast Fuel CHT and Potable Water Tanks
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-3220-04-01
<ARCHDATE>10242004
<CONTACT>Wayne Carrington, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-767-0393, Fax 202-767-5896, Email carrington@contracts.nrl.navy.mil - Wilberena Cosby, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-767-3090, Fax 202-767-5896, Email cosby@contracts.nrl.navy.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information issued by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), soliciting industry interest, input and capabilities for the supply of rapid cure coatings for use by the US Navy for corrosion control and protection of shipboard ballast, fuel, Combined Holding Tanks (CHT) and potable water tanks.  This solicitation is for existing and modifiable commercial off the shelf (COTS) products and will not be a research effort. Significant Navy forces and resources are spent in the maintenance of the Ships within the Fleet. Current coatings technology being used by the US Navy for the preservation of tanks is limited primarily to two (2) component solvent-free epoxy coatings. These coatings have significant disadvantages, in that: a) Current coatings require 8-12 hours (cure to walk-on) of controlled environmental conditions and ventilation to assure proper cure and minimal damage to freshly applied system. Such requirements place considerable time constraints on adjacent application and preservation activities do to risks associated with possible damage to freshly applied coating in neighboring tanks or spaces. b) The cumulative time requirements associated with conventional coatings results in a significant portion of current ship's availability period dedicated to the allowance of proper coating curing. c) The physical application parameters of existing coatings are not ideal when considering typical Navy shipyard locations and applications conditions. Therefore, the Navy, under the Office of Naval Research (ONR), has a desire to investigate the availability and/or development of "rapid cure" coatings for shipboard tank applications meeting these desired performance standards. Applicable coatings properties to include: Application under current industrial practices, as are present in a shipbuilding and ship repair environment; Application using commercially available plural component equipment, as is currently employed in industrial operations to include shipyards, general construction or infrastructure maintenance; Rapid Cure coating systems, consisting of rigid (non-elastomeric) epoxy, polyurea not based on polyether polyol technology for continuous immersion, polyurethane, or polyurethane hybrids, wherein, the cured system exhibits performance criteria to include the following properties: 1) Performance criteria, as outlined in MIL-PRF-23236C (SH), 2) Cure to walk-on times ranging from 5 seconds to 3 hours at 75 degrees Fahrenheit, Fully cured for service optimally @ 1 day, at 75 degrees Fahrenheit, 3) Overcoat windows greater than 45 minutes with substrate surface temperatures at 90 degrees Fahrenheit 4) Solvent free (95 g/l or less), 5) Free of aromatic amines (methylene dianiline), 6) Minimum of 70 percent edge retention at 12 mils DFT on a 1.0 mm radius applied per MIL-PRF-23236C Appendix - A, 7) Simple plural component mix ratios (i.e., 1:1, 2:1,or 4:1), 8) Suitable for seawater ballast, fuel and potable water tank application (to include NSF approval), compensated fuel/seawater, and combined holding transfer (CHT) tanks. Additionally, systems designed for exterior applications are also being sought. Coatings of interest need to exhibit application and performance properties as generally demonstrated by the current commercial industrial coatings employed for the preservation of steel and aluminum surfaces against corrosion in a seawater environment. The coatings shall not require specialized surface preparation and or application criteria beyond those currently outlined in the U.S. Navy's, Naval Ship's Technical Manual (NSTM) chapter 631 or outlined in Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Standard 009-32 for abrasive blast cleaning and coating application. In addition the coatings shall possess the ability to provide optimum performance under the application range of 18-30 mils Dry Film Thickness (DFT). All coatings shall also have the option of a repair material for touch-up of damaged areas, as is required for areas where routine maintenance and or structural repairs have been performed. Consideration should be given for the ability to remove and repair the coating using standard shipyard blasting practices. As a result, this Request for Information is being issued for the purpose of identifying those companies with appropriate expertise that might be interested in responding to a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the collaborative development of corrosion control coatings, similar to those discussed in the aforementioned text. Additional information on the Navy's corrosion control coatings requirements can be obtained from Mr. Arthur A. Webb at NRL. Should an RFP be issued for the development of corrosion control coatings for the Navy, it is anticipated that costs for development would be shared between the Navy and the contractor. This notice is being issued to help determine whether the Navy should proceed with a formal request for proposals. Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal request for proposals may be forthcoming. Offers should address as a minimum the following criteria: (1) capability and experience in re-formulation, production and/or modifications of rapid cure corrosion control coatings, and (2) understanding of application and performance issues regarding surface preparation and coating application conditions as present in a shipbuilding/repair environment. Offers are also requested to provide rough-order-of-magnitude estimates of the cost to develop the various coatings technologies, as well as estimated development time frame. Such estimates would be non-binding on the offers. This announcement is a request for information and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued nor will the government pay for the information solicited. All information and data received in response to this Request for Information marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected and held in strict confidence. Responses to this notice should be provided in writing to Naval Research Laboratory, ATTN: Mr. James Martin, Code 6138, P.O. Box 1759, Key West, FL 33040-1739 and copied to Naval Research Laboratory, ATTN: Mr. Arthur A. Webb, Code 6130, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, Washington, DC 20375-5342.  All responses must be in writing.

<SUBJECT>A -- HETEROGENEOUS URBAN RSTA (RECONNAISSANCE SURVEILLANCE AND TARGET ACQUISITION) TEAM
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Information Exploitation Office (IXO) intends to publish a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) on or before December 12, 2003 on the HURT program.  A Briefing to Industry (BTI) is scheduled for November 20, 2003 to be held in Arlington, VA.  Advanced registration for the BTI is required. No walk-ins will be registered at time of the BTI.  Persons not registered at time of BTI will not be admitted into the meeting.  At meeting check-in, registered participants will be required to show a government issued picture identification and pay a per person fee of $40.  Persons interested in attending the BTI are required to register by November 14, 2003.  For further information on location and on-line registration, reference URL: http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/BTI.    The purpose of the HURT BTI is to broadly articulate the vision, goals, technology organization and programmatic structure of the HURT program.  The BTI also provides an opportunity for interested persons to meet and begin to assess possibilities for collaboration.  HURT BTI briefing material and a FAQ will be posted at http://www.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/HURT/index.htm within 5 days following the BTI.  No handouts will be provided at the meeting.  The HURT program will develop technologies enabling mission-driven command and control of a heterogeneous team of uninhabited platforms for the conduct of coordinated urban operations.  The class of uninhabited platforms of particular interest in the HURT program is aerial vehicles.  The roboticized Reconnaissance Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) team, under HURT control, will provide services to warfighters according to user demand as modulated by mission priority subject to resource availability.  HURT technology will be used to decouple users from direct platform control and tasking.  HURT Platform Management technologies will provide symbolic representations of platform, payload and algorithm capabilities that allow mission-level planning and tasking.  HURT User Management technologies will permit multiple, dispersed users to formulate and register mission-centric service requests and will provide context-dependent service arbitration mechanisms.  HURT Planning/Control Technologies will permit tasking/retasking of RSTA team resources based on symbolic representations of available capabilities, mission-level service requests, arbitration policies, and subject to operational constraints.  Importantly, technologies developed in HURT will permit rapid integration (disintegration) of platforms into (out of) the team.  HURT will not be pursuing any platform-based autonomy, control, or sensing technologies; only collectively managing and controlling arbitrarily-teamed components. The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with the BTI discussed in this announcement.   All questions regarding this announcement and/or the HURT program, in general, are to be sent to BAA04-05@darpa.mil.  The Point of Contact for this announcement is Michael D. Blackstone, Contracting Officer, DARPA/CMO, email: mblackstone@darpa.mil. This announcement does not impose any obligation on the Government or signify a firm intention to enter into a contract.

<DESC>Dear Valued Contractor
     
We are excited to announce that we are finally able to offer you the opportunity to join us in the deployment of Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA).  

WAWF-RA is designed to automate Commercial Invoices and Government Receiving Reports in a web based, paperless environment.  WAWF-RA electronically captures and coordinates the four basic pieces of our payment process.  WAWA-RA users input their invoices and receiving reports via the Internet, and are compared to contracts stored in the Defense Finance Accounting System (DFAS) - Electronic Document Access (EDA) system. Once the invoice and receiving reports are approved and processed, payment transactions are initiated via Electronic File Protocol (EFT) to the contractor’s bank account.  DCMA at various locations (see below) has arranged to provide training to Contractor users of the new system.  They respectfully request you and/or your representative plan to attend one of these training sessions to be conducted at Comp USA sites.   You will need to contact the CompUSA Classroom POC identified on attached schedule in your geographic area to reserve a space for the training.  Additional training is available on-line at <https://skyraider.slidell.disa.mil> (About WAWF-RA).

There are no costs involved, registration and software are all provided FREE of charge and DCMA team will be there every step of the way if you need assistance.

This requirement is for Game Engine and license renewal, designed by Epic Games for Office of Secretary Defense.   As a means of the U.S. Army to actively seek a more effectively way to market its career opportunities to America's youth, a set of web-based, instrumented and networked video computer games has been implemented to attract young people and inform them of various aspects of Army life and Army career opportunities.  America’s Army is a computer-based animation game, designed to complement the Army's current Internet web page – www.GoArmy.com .  Through this on-line, computer-based game, the Army provides information via an entertaining virtual Army career experience to the user audience.  The game is hosted at www.americasarmy.com.  This procurement solicits for the provision of America’s Army web server, primary game engine.  This task order provides for renewal of game engine license for the exclusive game engine employed for this project.  This game engine is a very specific and integral component of the game server(s), which house and operate the America’s Army online game.  This primary game engine is a series of complex and application specific game driver subroutines and command modules, which provide for the basis of the authentication services, operation and execution of the online game versions of "America's Army: Operations and Soldiers".  The America’s Army Game Project has more than $10M invested in the present system and operation of the America’s Army online game.
