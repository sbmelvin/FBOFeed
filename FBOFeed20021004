<DESC>Provide Design-Build Services to design and construct approximately 1800sf of space to house a 1.5 Tesla MRI at the VA Medical Center, Hampton, Virginia.  This is a best value, two-phase design-build solicitation in accordance with FAR Part 36.3.  The Government will evaluate proposals using source selection procedures with the intent to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation as the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  The successful contractor must design and construct complete and usable facilities, as described in the RFP document.  One solicitation will be issued covering both phases.    Phase One of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to approximately five (5) offerors (design-build firms or teams) based on weighted design-build factors that include past performance, technical qualifications, and management approach.  Only those offerors selected in Phase One will be allowed to proceed into Phase Two.  In Phase Two, the competitive field will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project, which will be evaluated separately. The Phase Two Technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution for the project and other factors that define the quality of management, design and construction.  Price proposals will include total evaluated price, such as evaluation of scope/design options within the Government=92s published budget for award. =20 DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The project will include, in addition to the VA-furnished MRI unit, associated equipment and utility support, a waiting and reception area, unisex toilet facility, reading room, two changing rooms and two-stretcher patient holding area.  The site location will require relocation of a storm drain as well as design considerations of a sanitary sewer, which will be left in place under or very near the new construction.  The building will be single story masonry to match the existing facility; utility support in terms of electrical power and chilled water are both available within 150 feet of the site.  Detailed drawings will be provided by the manufacturer of the MRI for the installation of the MRI and the MRI=92s construction requirements.  Estimated cost for design and construction is between $250,000 and $500,000.  NAICS 236220, with a small business size standard of $28.5 million, applies to this procurement.  Copies of this solicitation will be available on or around October 11, 2002 by written request only.  Requests may be faxed to 910-482-5226.

<DESC>The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) has a requirement for contractor support in conducting tabletop/area exercises and security analytical support.  This Pre-solicitation notice announces that RSPA intends to release a solicitation (Request for Proposals (RFP)) for this requirement.  The National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) was designed to establish a workable program of tabletop and area exercises to further the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) that relate to spill response preparedness, while economically feasible for the government and the oil industry.  Contractor support is required for (1) up to twenty tabletop exercises (strategic exercises that focus on operator's spill management team and their approach to implementing their Facility Response Plan (FRP));  (2) up to four area exercises  (exercises that test the response by government, industry, and community players as detailed in the local Area Contingency Plan (ACP)); and (3) approximately five policy papers/reports (these papers/reports will identify courses of action to expedite the return to service of damaged pipelines).  It is anticipated that this requirement will be awarded as a three-year (base plus two option periods) cost plus award fee type contract.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541690 and the small business size standard is $6 million.  A copy of the solicitation will be available electronically in approximately 15 days after this posting, website: http://www.rspa.dot.gov, under Procurement Opportunities.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be made available.  This requirement is 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Ocean Services, Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, Bryan, Texas, intends to procure services to monitor and maintain the mooring buoy system. The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) consists of three separate areas, two located approximately 100 nautical miles SSE of Galveston, Texas, and the other, Stetson Bank, located approximately 70 nautical miles SSE of Galveston. 
FGBNMS regulations prohibit anchoring of all vessels within the Sanctuary boundaries.  Vessels less than 100 feet in registered length may utilize mooring buoys provided for that purpose.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) seeks to minimize anchor damage by educating the public, enforcing Sanctuary regulations, and providing alternatives to anchoring.  The mooring buoy system installed in the FGBNMS is intended to alleviate the problem of anchor damage to the coral reefs.  In addition to the mooring buoys, the Sanctuary has installed a radar reflecting buoy at each of the three banks to enhance navigation in the area.  The FGBNMS will provide the contractor the necessary materials for fabricating and repairing the buoys.  The contractor will be responsible for inspecting each buoy on a routine basis, repairing or replacing buoys or portions of buoys to ensure that the system is in optimum operating condition, and regular reporting of system conditions.  The maintenance program will consist of eight inspection periods.  The period of performance will be the award period and two 12-month option periods.  The following reports shall be submitted to the FGBNMS manager: (a) Status report after each system inspection.  The report will list all buoys and show the date of inspection, condition of components, and any repairs or replacement accomplished.  Also listed will be type and quantity of materials used for repairs or replacements (b) Status report showing dates of removal and installation of mooring buoys prior to or following the low-use (winter) season.  This report will also identify the numbers of buoys removed, left in place, or installed. (c) Semi-annual report (January and July of each year (of all mooring buoy components in the possession of the contractor, and a list of additional component supplies needed for the maintenance program for the next six months. This is a Small Business Set-aside.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.  The NAICS code is 332313.   This acquisition will be processed under the guidelines of FAR, Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. Offerors interested in receiving a copy of the RFQ should submit a request in writing to the attention of Sharon Clisso at the address listed above.   Facsimile requests will be accepted at (816) 426-7530. Requests for Quotes (RFQ) will be available on or about October 22, 2002.

<DESC>The BEP will conduct two site visits in order to allow prospective offerors to view the equipment and site conditions.  The site visits have been scheduled at the following times and place:  Date: September 30, 2002, Time:  8:30 a.m.; Date: October 1, 2002, Time:  8:30 a.m.;  Location:  Bureau of Engraving & Printing, 13th Street (between C and D Streets), SW, Washington, DC  20228-0001.  Due to the closure of the BEP?s 14th Street entrance all conference participants must access the BEP at the 13th & C Street entrance.  Interested parties are required to submit the names of the individuals that plan to attend not later than 24 hours prior to the date and time of the conference.  As the site visit on September 30, 2002 is a Monday, offerors must submit their request no later than Friday, September 27, 2002 by 4:00 p.m.  This time constraint is required due to security reasons.  Submission or substitutions to the names of the individuals attending may not be changed after the 24- hour time limitation.  Offeror?s are limited to a maximum of two (2) representatives from each firm due to  limited space availability for each site visit.  Due to limited time and security constraints an offeror may attend only one site visit.  These limitations are to ensure that all prospective offerors that request a site visit will be given an opportunity to attend.  The Government will try to accommodate the offeror?s request for one of the specified site visit dates, if possible.  Interested parties are to submit their company?s name, name(s) of individual(s) and their title that are planning to attend, and a point of contact including their phone number.  This information must be submitted in writing to Larry McCain, Contract Specialist at the following email address: larry.mccain@bep.treas.gov/.  The duration of time for the site visit will be determined at the discretion of the Contracting Officer and/or Contract Specialist.  Individuals attending the conference must provide picture identification (e.g., drivers license or passport) and should arrive at least 30 minutes prior to the conference start time to allow for processing through security.  Additional dates for site visits will only be established if both site visit dates are full and the offeror?s request for site visit was submitted 24-hours prior to the first scheduled site visit.  Additional site visits will not be scheduled due to an offeror?s inability to attend the scheduled visits or due to an offeror?s failure to submit their request to attend a site visit 24-hours prior to the first scheduled site visit.  This site visit is optional.  In no event shall failure to visit the delivery site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.

<CONTACT>Michele Foster, 732-427-1487
<DESC>NA The purpose of this Amendment is to give a more detailed description of the intended effort.  The Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Research Development & Engineering Center (RDEC), Space & Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD) is plannin g to adopt, adapt and mature technologies developed and demonstrated under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Small Unit Operations Situation Awareness System (SUO SAS) Phase 3 advanced development effort.  The DARPA SUO SAS Phase 3 radi o communications and wideband networking waveform (WNW) technologies are under consideration as a potential Soldier Radio candidate for the Objective Force Warrior (OFW) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  Technology maturation of the SUO SAS Phase 3  WNW is being addressed to achieve TRL 6 by April 2005 to support integration with the OFW ATD and Future Combat System (FCS) Block I System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase Early User Test & Evaluation (EUTE) operational demonstrations in the 200 6 timeframe.  As such, technology maturation efforts will ensure the radio communications prototype hardware is size (form factor), weight and power consumption (SWAP) compatible with OFW soldier platform and the Soldier Radio WNW is JTRS Software Communic ations Architecture (SCA) compliant and compatible with FCS Block I SDD platforms and interoperable with OFW soldier platforms. The key operational capabilities and technical design features demonstrated under SUO SAS Phase 3 include: scaleable radio frequency (RF), software programmable radio, adaptive wideband networking waveform (WNW), and multi-tier ad hoc network formation and  multi-hop link-layer routing protocols.  A scaleable RF design feature is desired to address multiple RF channels (1, 2 or 3) and communications simultaneity, supporting multi-net operations.  The scaleable RF design will also address extending the operat ing frequency range (2-2500 MHz) to match the propagation environment for flexible operations.  A software programmable radio capability is needed to address the networking application domain needs of squad-level voice/data communications and unattended se nsors, fires, and intelligent munitions.  Software programmable radio capability is expected to support future radio communications upgrades through software modifications.  An adaptive WNW design is needed to support transmission security (TRANSEC) -based  low probability of detection (LPD) and anti-jam (AJ) performance against sophisticated electronic warfare threats.  The adaptive WNW will support variable communications signal bandwidth features to ensure compatibility with worldwide spectrum policies an d international agreements, as well as, providing variable data rates to improve information bandwidth and enhance processing gain and link stability under dynamic mobile conditions and multi-path environments.  Multi-tier ad hoc network formation and mult i-hop link-layer routing features are needed to support voice and data communications in complex terrain and urban environments.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration, Office of Contracts and Procurement, DMA-30, 400 7th Street, SW, Room 7104, Washington, DC 20590 has a requirement for contractor support in conducting the Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) tabletop/area exercises and security analytical support as described below. This requirement is 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES with the capabilities to perform this requirement as set forth in this announcement. The Government and industry representatives created the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) through a series of public workshops in 1994.  PREP was designed to establish a workable program of tabletop and area exercises to further the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) that relates to spill response preparedness, while being economically feasible for the government and the oil industry.  To assist the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) in meeting its PREP responsibilities, contractor support is required, including technical support for up to twenty (20) tabletop exercises, up to four (4) area exercises and the submission of policy papers, security assessment reports and after action reports. Tabletop exercises are strategic exercises focusing on the operator's spill management team and their approach to implementing their Facility Response Plan (FRP).  Area exercises are designed to show that all of the agencies, which have a role in responding to spills, are adequately prepared to do so.  Area exercises are meant to test the response by government, industry, and community players as detailed in the local Area Contingency Plan (ACP).  With RSPA's emphasis on pipeline safety as an integral component of safety, RSPA intends to expand its exiting exercise program under PREP to include security issues in the scenarios by the use of security analytical support.   In performance of the security analytical support services, the contractor will identify courses of action for RSPA to take to expedite the return to service of damaged pipelines. The exercises will also require that the contractor submit the following deliverables:  (1) Policy papers, (2) Security Assessment Reports, (3) After Action Reports, (4) Exercise Schedules (Calendar), (5) Tabletop Player's Manual ( i.e., notebook for each participant that contains information such as exercise scenario, ground rules, feedback forms, blank pages and lessons learned), (6) Exercise Synopsis, (7) Exercise Reports, (8) Operator's Performance Reports, (9) Area Exercise Scenario's and (10) Lessons Learned Reports/Input.  The contractor will use audio-visual and computer technology to enhance the realism of the exercises. Contractor personnel must possess requisite technical qualifications to perform this requirement. All contract staff must possess a secret clearance or be able to qualify for a secret clearance. REMINDER:  This requirement is 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to be one base year (twelve months) with the possibility of two (2) option years (twelve months each).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541690 and the small business size standard is $6 million.  It is anticipated that this procurement will be awarded as a Cost Plus Award Fee type contract.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command is seeking small business sources with the experience and capabilities to design, develop, fabricate and deliver two (2) Classroom Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) System Trainers (CESTs) with display stands, and /or five (5) Practical Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) System Trainers (PESTs) with display stands for the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS).  The Classroom Explosive Ordnance Disposal System Trainer (CEST) shall be a 45-degree cutaway of the entire Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System rocket.  The CEST must display all energetic component locations, all toxic materiel locations, Electronic Safe and Arm Device location(s), classified components, and other internal physical features and/or elect rical components, which may be associated with the ultimate EOD render safe procedures.  The CEST may be scaled-down (e.g. 50% to scale, etc.).  If scaled, the CEST must accurately reflect the location and representation of internal components.  Based upon  the size and/or configuration of the CEST, handling equipment such as a mobile display stand, (i.e. with casters or wheels), may be required to facilitate movement within the classroom, etc.  The Government requires acceptance of the proposed design of th e CESTs, prior to fabrication of hardware.  The Government reserves the right to implement changes to the CESTs hardware, based upon review of source data as it is developed.  The Practical Explosive Ordnance Disposal System Trainer (PEST) shall be identic al externally to the actual missile, i.e., dimensions, weight, painting and markings, breaks in the body (panels, sections), fins/control surfaces, and guidance section.  In general, configuration of internal components is not critical unless a component o r components are specifically related to a physical procedure that EOD must accomplish to perform the EOD Render Safe Procedure.  Therefore, if required by EOD, the contractor shall incorporate internal feature(s).  Items of a hazardous nature (energetic, toxic, and mechanical stored energy devices) will not be incorporated in PEST hardware.  Additionally, if a physical procedure is proposed requiring special tools or disassembly to satisfy Render Safe Procedures, the trainer requirements may be more string ent.  Based upon the size and/or configuration of the PESTs, special handling hardware, (i.e. slings, strong backs, etc.) may be required to facilitate movement within the training and/or storage/maintenance area.  The Government requires acceptance of the  proposed design of the PESTs, prior to fabrication of hardware.  The Government reserves the right to implement changes to the PEST hardware, based upon review of source data as it is developed.  Required delivery date for these items is 1 September 2004.   The methods of procurement and NAICS Codes for these requirements have yet to be determined.  Small businesses with the experience and capabilities to satisfy either one or both of these requirements should submit a brief statement of experience and capa bilities by 4 November 2002 to the contracting office, addressed as follows:  U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, Attn: AMSAM-AC-TM-C / MAJ Dolloff, Building 5303, Martin Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5280.

<CONTACT>Barbara Rufo, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-5589, Fax 410-786-9088, Email BRufo@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>This notification is a Request for Information.  Comments/questions are due on November 15, 2002.  Comments/Questions should be submitted via the Internet at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/contracts/bipa521.asp.  The Draft QIC and AdQIC SOWs can be found at that web site as well.

You are invited and encouraged to submit comments on the QIC Draft SOW and the AdQIC Draft SOW.  The QIC and AdQIC effort is envisioned by CMS as an important step in implementing the revised 2nd level appeals process as required by BIPA, Section 521.  We would value your comments on any aspects of the SOWs, including areas that need further clarification, requirements that should be added or deleted, or any other concerns that you identify.                                              BACKGROUND:  BIPA Section 521 requires, among other things, the establishment of new entities known as Qualified Independent Contractors (QICs) to conduct reconsiderations of contractors? initial determinations or redeterminations.  CMS has extensive information about BIPA on http://cms.hhs.gov/healthplans/bipa/bipafact.asp.               CMS foresees two (2) major components of the BIPA Section 521 2nd level appeals contractor process.  The QICs will adjudicate reconsiderations and expedited reconsiderations of initial determinations made by fiscal intermediaries, carriers, or quality improvement organizations, using established protocols; and, QICs will, collect and transmit information regarding the receipt and disposition of reconsiderations and expedited reconsiderations via the Reconsideration Tracking and Reporting System (RTRS).  The second component will be an Administrative QIC or AdQIC.  The AdQIC will provide technical support for the Reconsideration Tracking and Reporting System (RTRS); and, collect, track and distribute information regarding the receipt, processing and disposition of reconsiderations and expedited reconsideration requests.                                        You are invited to submit comments/questions regarding both Draft SOWs.  In addition, there are also several specific questions and SOW areas for which CMS is particularly interested in receiving comments/questions.  These specific CMS questions are identified at the web site.   CMS will evaluate comments received from the general public at the end of the comment period.  CMS will not respond directly to any comments submitted, but will modify the QIC and AdQIC Draft SOWs based on the comments received before we begin any formal solicitation process.                         FAR CLAUSE 52.215-3 Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) is hereby incorporated in accordance with FAR 15.207:    (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of promoting a partnership by providing potential offerors the opportunity to comment on the Government?s requirement as it relates to industry standards.             Please be advised that any innovative approach, methodology, strategy, or other information submitted pursuant to this request for comment(s) will become the property of CMS for its unlimited use.  Persons and/or entities submitting any innovative approach, methodology, strategy, or other information to CMS for consideration waive any and all claim to such information.       At this time, CMS has not yet finalized its plans for issuing a formal solicitation for the QIC and AdQIC effort.  The information obtained from comments/questions received on the draft SOWs will allow CMS to make decisions regarding the program and a potential solicitation for contract award(s).  Anyone who submits comments/questions on the draft SOWs will be notified when CMS issues a solicitation for submission of formal proposals.  Any questions should be directed to Barbara Rufo, Contract Specialist, at (410)786-5589, or by sending e-mail to BRufo@CMS.HHS.Gov.  E-mail communications should include company name, address, and point of contact, phone and fax numbers.   Thank you in advance for your interest in this program.  Your questions and comments on the QIC and AdQIC Draft SOWs are very valuable to CMS and your participation is greatly appreciated.
