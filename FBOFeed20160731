<p>E.6 ADDENDUM to FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>The following provisions are incorporated into 52.212-2 as an addendum to this solicitation:</p>
<p>Basis for Contract Award</p>
<p>This is a best value contract selection. The Government will utilize a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable ("LPTA") evaluation method for this requirement. Trade-offs between cost/price and non-cost/price factors are not permitted. The Government will award a single contract to the Contractor whose proposal is technically acceptable and the lowest price. Subject to the provisions contained herein, the Government intends to award a single contract resulting from this solicitation to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented, whose offer conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, and all other information required by the solicitation), provides the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable offer to satisfy the requirements of this solicitation and the SOW. Offers that fail to address all the requirements set forth in the Solicitation will be rejected.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with<br />Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's submission should contain their best terms from a cost and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to reject an offer upon initial submission and not consider it for contract award if any required data is absent or the data received conveys a misunderstanding of the requirement.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Each Offeror's proposal MUST include the following components:</p>
<p>Volume I: Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Technical Capability: The Technical Factor evaluation provides an assessment of the offeror's capability to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements. The Technical Capability Volume shall be clear, concise, and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims in the Offeror's quote. Legibility, clarity and coherence are very important. Your responses will be evaluated against the Technical factors defined below. The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the offeror intends to meet these requirements. Statements that the offeror understands, can, or will comply with the SOW (including referenced publications, technical data, etc.); statements paraphrasing the SOW or parts thereof (including applicable publications, technical data, etc.); and phrases such as "standard procedures will be employed" or "well known techniques will be used," etc., will be considered unacceptable. Offerors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their facilities and experience, and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the offeror's proposal. Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed art work, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired.</p>
<p>a. Quoter shall submit certification and demonstrate capability of inspecting, testing, maintaining and repairing Notifier Onyx type and Simplex Grinnell 4100 ES type Fire Alarm Systems in accordance with NFPA 72 - National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code and NFPA 13 - Installation of Automatic Fire Sprinkler Systems.</p>
<p>b. Quoter shall submit name, point of contact, capabilities and experience of monitoring service.</p>
<p>c. Quoter shall submit details of previous contracts within the last three years of similar scope and size of this acquisition, including government contracts.</p>
<p>d. Quoter shall submit certification and demonstrate proposed vendor technicians performing repairs or programming changes to the systems possess a valid, current, NICET Level III Fire Alarm Technician certification. The technician shall also be factory trained and certified by the respective fire alarm system equipment manufacturer.</p>
<p>The Technical Capability factor will be assigned an overall adjectival rating at the factor level. <br />An Offeror shall achieve a minimum rating of "Acceptable" in the Technical Capability factor to be viable for award and shall demonstrate a sound approach that meets all requirements and objectives of the SOW.</p>
<p>TABLE 1<br />Technical Capabilities Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings</p>
<p>Ratings Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation<br />To note, failure to provide a complete, detailed, realistic, and reasonable quote may reflect a lack of understanding of the requirements and may result in a determination that the Offeror's quote is unacceptable. The Government does not assume a duty to search for clarification data to cure problems or inconsistencies with an Offeror's quote. Evaluations will be on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. A failure in any one of the above requirements constitutes a failure for factor 1 and will not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>Volume II: Past Performance:</p>
<p>This standard is based upon the offeror's ability to substantiate credible examples of past performance associated with their commercial and Government offerings, inclusive of delivery, schedule compliance, product quality, and overall customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance record to determine acceptability of a quote as follows:</p>
<p>Past Performance shall be evaluated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable".</p>
<p>The offeror will be evaluated on how well the contractor performed on the recent and relevant contracts submitted in the Past Performance quote.</p>
<p>The offeror will be evaluated on the past performance record provided as part of the quote and any other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources which may include: Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and information from any other sources deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>The quote must identify three (3) contracts/task orders with the Federal Government and/or commercial customers that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance. Recent is defined as within the last three (3) years. Relevant is defined as work similar in complexity and magnitude of the work described in this SOW. This information shall include all of the following information for each identified contract/task order: <br />&bull; Project title <br />&bull; Description of the project <br />&bull; Contract number <br />&bull; Contract amount <br />&bull; Government Agency/Organization <br />&bull; COR's name, address, and phone number <br />&bull; Contracting Officer's name, address, and phone number <br />&bull; Contract and, if applicable, task order number <br />&bull; Current status, e.g., completed and/or if in progress, start and estimated completion dates<br />&bull; Dollar value and type of contract <br />&bull; Name of company being referenced <br />&bull; SOW paragraphs that the reference applies to <br />&bull; Key personnel (please highlight those individuals who worked on the relevant project(s) and are also being proposed for this effort.) <br />&bull; A brief narrative of why you deem the reference to be relevant to this effort. <br />&bull; Name/organization/position and phone number of knowledgeable individual who can be queried by Government evaluators</p>
<p>Each quote will be evaluated to the extent to which the offeror has demonstrated an ability and willingness to perform: 1) A quality product or service (i.e. the conformance to contract requirements, specifications, and standards of good workmanship); 2) Timeliness of the contract with regard to completion of contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules and administrative requirements (e.g., effort that contributes to or affects the schedule variance); 3) Acceptable cost control with regard to the offeror's effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract cost; 4) Good business relationships with regard to the timeliness, completeness and quality of problem identification and resolution, offeror's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior, customer satisfaction, timely award and management of subcontracts, and whether the contractor met their small/small disadvantaged and women owned business participation goals; 5) Management of personnel with regard to demonstration of a commitment to the management of personnel with regard to the offeror's performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing when necessary, personnel; and Regulator Compliance.</p>
<p>Should the Government discover adverse past performance information to which the offeror(s) had not had a prior opportunity to respond, the Contracting Officer will conduct communications if deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>The Past Performance Evaluation Team will review this past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to performance confidence assessment.</p>
<p>Assigning Ratings. The Past Performance Factor will be assigned one of the ratings defined below.</p>
<p>Table 2. Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Volume III Price</p>
<p>Price proposal shall contain pricing information. The prices shall be provided in accordance with Price/Cost Schedule, failure to provide pricing shall be cause for rejection of the proposal. Offers shall include pricing for the base year and all option years</p>
<p>Technically acceptable quotes found to have a satisfactory record of past performance will be evaluated for the lowest price.</p>
<p>The price offered by the Contractor will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness utilizing price analysis techniques. If additional information is required, the Government may require a breakdown of the price offered. Award will be based on the lowest priced quote that meets or exceeds the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.</p>
<p>The prices proposed by the Offers with "Acceptable" technical capabilities and past performance rating will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness. Offers that are not considered "Acceptable", in accordance with the "Evaluation Factors for Award" outlined below, will no longer be considered for award and price will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>Price will not be scored or rated. Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more of the price analysis techniques such as comparison to other offers, historical rates, and/or the Government's Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are fair, reasonable and complete. To be viable for award, offeror's price must be determined fair and reasonable by the Government. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the pricing is not complete.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the pricing proposed for each CLIN and the total price proposed. The Government will evaluate the price for award purposes by adding the price of the base year and the four one-year option periods and comparing that total price for balance and against all of the proposals found to be technically acceptable. Price will not be evaluated on those proposals found to be Technically Unacceptable.</p>
<p>Definitions.</p>
<p>Reasonableness. A price is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business.</p>
<p>Completeness/Accuracy. The offeror's proposal is in compliance with the Price Volume instructions in the solicitation."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: Life, accident, and health insurance plans, sick leave, pension<br />plans, civic and personal leave, severance pay, and savings and thrift plans.<br />Minimum employer contributions costing an average of $4.27 per hour computed on the<br />basis of all hours worked by service employees employed on the contract.</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE

a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure
VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct onsite inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.

c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.

d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.

e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.

k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.

l. Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. 

The options are:
(1) Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
(2) VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
(3) VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase. 
(4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;

(a) The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; 

(b) Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.

(c) A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed.
The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.

4. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover.

5. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. However, it is the policy of VA to forgo collection of liquidated damages in the event the contractor provides payment of actual damages in an amount determined to be adequate by the agency.

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:

(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
(2) Description of the event, including:

(a) Date of occurrence;
(b) Data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control; 
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons); VA information, obtain monetary or other
(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and
Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.

d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals 
consisting of the following:

 (1) Notification;
 (2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least
3 relevant credit bureau reports;
 (3) Data breach analysis;

(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;

(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and

(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

6. CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONDISCLOSURE

      It is agreed that:

a. The preliminary and final deliverables and all associated working papers, application source code, and other material deemed relevant by the VA which have been generated by the contractor in the performance of this task order are the exclusive property of the U.S. Government and shall be submitted to the CO at the conclusion of the task order.

b.

Touch-up Work<br />If the finished painting of surface areas painted under the scope of this Section becomes damaged or scraped during the course of installing incinerator-mounted components and devices, such areas shall be touched-up or repainted in accordance with procedures recommended by the paint manufacturer. Such touch-up work shall be completed prior to commencing with performance testing,</p>
<p>3.2 PRIME AND FINISH COATS</p>
<p>A. Surface Preparation<br />All exposed ferrous surfaces to be painted or repainted shall be thoroughly cleaned of rust, dirt, oil, grease, and other foreign matter. If existing paint sections or areas are found to be peeling, flaking, or blistering, paint in those areas shall be removed to bare metal by scraping and / or sanding. Surface cleaning and preparation shall be done by using solvents, hand tools, and / or power tools.</p>
<p>B. Priming<br />After all surfaces have been thoroughly cleaned and wiped free of dust, they shall be given a prime coat as specified herein.</p>
<p>C. Finish Coats<br />After the prime coat has thoroughly dried, apply two (2) full coats of specified and approved heat-resistant paint. Paint shall be applied by brush and / or roller. First coat shall be allowed to dry overnight before applying second coat, and the first coat shall be lightly sanded before the second is applied.</p>
<p>3.3 APPLICATION<br />A. Paint shall be stirred before and during application to produce uniform color and density. Do not add thinners, solvents, or other paint.</p>
<p>B. Use applicators and techniques best suited to the paint being applied as recommended by the manufacturer. Finished surfaces shall be free of brush marks, laps, roller skids, and other imperfections.<br />C. Do not paint over nameplates, UL or other code-required labels, or equipment identification tags. Also, do not paint operating portions of valves, dampers, sensing devices, controls, motors, or similar devices.</p>
<p>D. If there are any questions or uncertainties of which surfaces, items or components are to be painted or not painted, it is the Contractor's responsibility to obtain clarifications and directions from the Government and / or the Designated Project Representative before proceeding. If any surfaces, items, or components are painted that should not have been painted, such paint shall be thoroughly removed as expeditiously as possible.</p>
<p>E. Surrounding surfaces and items shall be protected from damage during painting by use of protective materials that can be removed without leaving a residue, staining, or causing damage. Temporary protective coverings, painter's tape, and the like shall be removed upon completion of painting work.</p>
<p><br />3.4 DELIVERY<br />A. Deliver paint and primer in original containers and with manufacturers' labels intact. Labels shall indicate manufacturers' names, product names, listing of pigments and vehicle constituents, color identification, and application instructions.</p>
<p>B. Store paint materials at the project site in a single location that is protected from freezing and as directed by the Government.</p>
