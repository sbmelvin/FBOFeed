<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, New Jersey has a requirement for the following in support of the Navy for shipboard power lighting as follows: This synopsis is to alert prospective suppliers of the government’s intention to solicit a dual purpose illumination system for amphibious ship well decks. 1. The dual functions of the lighting system are: Illumination “Compatible with” (preferred) or “friendly to” (acceptable) Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) equipment currently in use by the U. S. Navy, and at the same time provide adequate lighting for non-NVIS wearers during night operation. General purpose white lighting illumination system for supporting daytime and inport night operation. 2.  The SYSTEM should be designed to illuminate a space (LHD 1 Class Well Deck) with dimensions comparable to: (330’) L  x  (50’) W  x  (35’) H. 3. The SYSTEM shall furnish both white general purpose illumination for daylight, inport night operation, and non-NVIS compatibility operations; and Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) illumination “compatible with” or “friendly to” NVIS systems that also maintain enough visible illumination for unaided personnel to safely move about and operate forklifts and other mechanized equipment to reload landing craft of various types.  The SYSTEM may utilize two groups of light emitters, for use with and without NVIS or a single system of fixtures that provide both NVIS compatible lighting and non-compatible white general purpose lighting.  Alternate methods of obtaining the desired lighting environment may be acceptable. 4. The Shipboard Environment that the lighting system equipment should be expected to operate continuously within include: Environmental conditions where the maximum temperatures from the centerline to 28.75 feet off centerline range between 94°C to 260°C (200°F to 500°F), the system should be able to withstand maximum temperature for a period of 80 seconds maximum, and all systems in the space should be able to withstand a constant 94°C (200°F) and 50 knot gas turbine exhaust blast environment. Input electrical power at 115VAC (60 Hz) ungrounded. Lighting System Controls centrally located at a single control point at the periphery of the space to be illuminated. 5. a. The operational scenario(s) for the NVIS Illumination system include: 1. Illumination for safe recovery of landing craft operated by NVIS equipped pilots (aided) aboard the ship and reloading of landing craft by personnel (unaided) who are NOT equipped with NVIS equipment. 2. Illumination to support concurrent sea and air operations under darkened conditions, including loading of landing craft in the Well Deck with the ship’s stern gate (door 60 feet wide by 30 feet high) open, while aircraft with NVIS equipped pilots approach the ship for landing and re-supply from the either aft quadrant. (As a result of this operational requirement the NVIS friendly illumination system should be dimmable at the request of NVIS equipped pilot(s).  The wavelength and radiance of the spilling light must be “NVIS friendly” and not “bloom or shutdown” the aircraft pilot’s NVIS equipment.  NVIS illumination levels shall be variable from 1 to 8 footcandles without exceeding allowable NVIS radiance and NVIS intensity levels). b. The operational scenario for the White Illumination System include:	1. The system will be designed to provide an initial uniform 14 Footcandles minimum. 6. For test, evaluation and qualifying purposes the baseline NVIS systems that the illumination system should be “friendly” with are: -Type I, AN/AVS-6 NVG with Class “A” Minus Blue Filter* -Type I, AN/VIS-9 NVG with Class “B” Minus Blue Filter* (*SEE MIL-STD-3009 for definitions of Type I, Class A, B and spectral response plots for NVIS-A and NVIS-B devices) 7. The lighting fixtures are to be installed above the port and starboard catwalks along the longitudinal axis of the ship at approximately 28 feet above the well deck.  Light sources shall be designed to allow for fixture rotation through elevation and azimuth to optimize illumination for ship’s crew.  All fixture must be accessible  from the catwalks. The solicitation will appear on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil. Bid Samples may be required at a later date. Select “Business”, then “Doing Business with us” and then “Open Solicitation”. No solicitations will be mailed and no hard copies of solicitations will be made available. Responsible sources are advised to monitor the web site listed above for Request for Proposal (RFP) release and RFP amendments, as necessary. The estimated release of the RFP is 06 July 2004. Phone, fax or e-mail requests for RFP will not be accepted. The Government anticipates a firm fixed-price award as a result of this solicitation. This solicitation is being issued on a Full and Open Competition basis.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the Kennedy Institute of Ethics (KIE), Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., a five year contract, "Support of the National Reference Center for Bioethics Literature Library as a Complementary Resource to the National Library of Medicine AND the Identification, Creation and Maintenance of Bioethics Records for the National Library of Medicine."  This contract will merge two previous NLM contracts: one which supported the activities of the National Reference Center for Bioethics Literature (NRCBL) and the second which provided for the continued identification, organization and dissemination of bibliographic data related to the field of bioethics for the National Library of Medicine databases. Both previous contracts were awarded to KIE, Georgetown University, on a sole source basis. Under this new contract the KIE will provide collection development, library and outreach services in the field of bioethics, as well as being responsible for the acquisition and indexing of bioethics-related books, journal articles, reports and other items for the NLM databases or for the NRCBL, which will serve as a complementary resource to NLM.  Because many of the publications are not totally bioethics-oriented, skill is needed to determine those publications that warrant inclusion in the systems.  This requires knowledge of the original BIOETHICSLINE database's scope and coverage, trends and issues in the field of bioethics, and familiarity with NLM's software systems used to create database records.  Since the early 1970’s the Kennedy Institute has successfully acquired and indexed references to bioethics material.  They also actively make recommendations for MeSH (NLM’s controlled medical vocabulary).  The Kennedy Institute owns the rights to the data produced under the BIOETHICSLINE database during the period 1974 through 1987.  In addition the Kennedy Institute keeps on file a hard copy of each indexed citation, which is required for the interlibrary loan program.   The KIE bioethics library was established by Georgetown University in 1973.  In 1985 when Congress asked NLM to establish a National Reference Center for Bioethics Literature (NRCBL), KIE, under Georgetown University, was awarded the grant to do that work after a competitive review process and NLM has funded it ever since.  The NCRBL has developed a unique specialized collection that is multidisciplinary in scope and coverage and serves as a major national resource for bioethics.  Due to the fact that the Kennedy Institute houses and owns a portion of the NRCBL collection and owns the rights to a substantial portion of the data produced makes them the only firm capable of fulfilling NLM's requirements without undue delays and duplication of effort. It has been determined that the Kennedy Institute is the only source with the necessary materials for running the NRCBL and the expertise for selecting the appropriate data to be added and maintained in NLM data systems according to a defined bioethics subject scope without duplication of effort.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>Federal Business Opportunities synopsis for NRA NNH04ZUU002N, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research Announcement:  NASA's Office of Biological and Physical Research (OBPR), solicits proposals for NASA Specialized Center of Research (NSCOR) for the Estimation of Solid Tumor Cancer Risks from Space Radiation. The central focus of this solicitation is research that will provide the basis for estimation of solid tumor cancer risks from space radiation.  Analysis of epidemiological data on human and animal populations exposed to ionizing radiation is not expected to lead to the desired levels of accuracy, and cannot provide the understanding of biological processes intervening between radiation exposure and manifest disease. However, it is also recognized that molecular biology mechanisms, by themselves, are necessary but not sufficient as a basis for human risk estimates. This solicitation assumes that the required advances will evolve from studies with animal models and tissues, elucidating mechanisms hypothesized on the basis of cellular and molecular studies, and extrapolating the knowledge acquired to different species; in particular, to humans. This solicitation does not solicit large-population animal studies or proposals for life-span studies or similar investigations.  All applicants are required to discuss how their research may lead to risk estimates for protons and HZE particles, using animal models, including transgenic models of human cancers and how the proposed results can be extrapolated to estimate human solid tumor cancer risk from space radiation. In this context, cross-species comparisons using intermediate biological models representative of complex human models (e.g., skin, rat trachea, lung, etc.) may be of interest. In some cases, such extrapolations may not be obtainable directly from the research proposed; in those cases, investigators are required to make a compelling case for the argument that their research will result in major advances that are required for future extrapolation.   An assessment of the statistical power of analysis associated with the research is required, keeping in mind the NASA objective of attaining ±50% as the error in the predicted probability of excess solid tumor cancer fatality. It is likely that other consequences of space radiation exposure will become incorporated in future radiation risk assessments and need to be considered by investigators, where appropriate. While attainment of the eventually desired error margin may not be possible for current investigations, it is nevertheless a requirement that investigators attempt to provide a realistic, quantitative assessment of the extent to which their proposed research is likely to contribute to this objective. Radiation exposures required to conduct the research will use ground-based irradiation facilities at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in Upton, New York.  NASA will not fund beam time or related expenses at accelerator facilities other than BNL. The primary criterion for an award will be scientific merit. Proposers are encouraged to establish interdisciplinary teams. All participants in this solicitation are strongly encouraged to promote general scientific literacy and public understanding of life sciences, the space environment, and the OBPR programs through formal and informal education opportunities.  Where appropriate, supported investigators will collaborate with NASA to develop a plan for communicating their work to the public.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made.  For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price, with past performance being considered equal to price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as required delivery dates, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.
            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal, who meets the government’s required delivery dates, will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision) 

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items with its offer. This provision is attached to this combined synopsis / solicitation.

The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) applies to this acquisition.

The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders—Commercial Items, as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) applies to this acquisition.

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made.  For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price, with past performance being considered equal to price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as required delivery dates, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.
            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal, who meets the government’s required delivery dates, will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision) 

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provisions at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items with its offer.   See attachment for the provision.
The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) applies to this acquisition.

<CONTACT>Phyllis Townsley, 405-954-7816
<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT/SIR number 3625 was issued May 4, 2004 and cancelled on May 5, 2004.  Announcement/SIR1 be re-issued June 7, 2004 with a response date of June 18, 2004. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is announcing its plans for the acquisition of Security Guard Services for the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The general scope of work for these Security Guard Services will require the contractor to procure armed guard services which provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, information, facilities, United States government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage, and terrorism.  Requirements are further defined in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The current version of the SOW is provided as a separate document under this announcement. Services will be performed at the MMAC.  Interested parties are also encouraged to visit the MMAC Home Page.  This acquisition will use streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) of 1997.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options. The procurement action resulting from this Announcement/SIR1 is contemplated as a set-aside for competitive award among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs) that are expressly certified by the SBA for participation in the SBAâ€™s 8(a) program.  Only those 8(a) vendors that are certified under the SBA in Area VI (AR, LA, NM, OK, and TX) will be allowed to participate in this Announcement/SIR1.  To be considered, a vendor must be classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services - $10.5/million.  Each firm claiming 8(a) status is required to provide a copy of its SBA 8(a) certification letter to the Contracting Officer with its response to this Announcement/SIR1.  Firms are to submit an FAA Business Declaration form with your response to this Announcement/SIR1.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each vendor's program eligibility. In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.   This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the Announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit companies that are certified under the 8(a) program with SBA within Area VI an opportunity to express an interest in this requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this Announcement/SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this Announcement/SIR1.   Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendorâ€™s eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendorâ€™s eligibility pursuant to this Announcement/SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendorâ€™s information.  Any statement included in a vendorâ€™s response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  All documentation is limited to 10 pages (8-1/2â€x11â€, printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendorâ€™s response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendorâ€™s submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendorâ€™s eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an â€œacceptable/unacceptableâ€ basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable). 1.  Past Performance and Experience: (Note: Past performance represents â€œhow wellâ€ an offeror accomplished the effort.  Experience simply means an offeror has â€œdone it.â€  Of additional importance is that past performance and experience must be current and relevant as well as comparable in scope and magnitude to that described in the SOW.) 	(a) In order to be determined acceptable vendors must have five years experience in performing security guard services as identified in the attached SOW.  In evaluating experience of vendors whose experience was attributed to a pre-existing or through a previous company, any such experience will be considered.  Vendors shall provide a list of relevant past and present contracts performed for Federal, State, or Local Governments or commercial sources within the past five (5) years involving effort of same or similar complexity, magnitude, and level.  The vendorâ€™s documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information stated below. (i)	Contract number and contract type (ii)	Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, etc.) (iii)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options) (iv)	A brief description of the contract effort (v)	Largest number of employees associated with direct contract effort (vi)	Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the  	Government Contracting Officer(s); for non-government  	contracts, provide the name, address, telephone and FAX  	numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc. 	(b) Where inquiries made pursuant to (a)(vi) reveal the vendorâ€™s performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process. 2.  Organizational Management and Staffing: Vendors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneously employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed 75 or more full-time employees for a period not less than one (1) year.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to: a spreadsheet containing a list of employees and their managers, and the contracts on which they performed, etc. A copy of the current contract and modifications, (DTFA-02-01-D-01850), can be downloaded from the AMQ Internet at http:\\amq.mmac.faa.gov (click on FOIA Reading Room). Interested firms that can comply with and meet the special standards of responsibility addressed in this Announcement/SIR 1 should respond with their documentation in writing to: Federal Aviation Administration Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center NAS Contracting Division Attn:  AMQ-210/Phyllis Townsley Room 321, Multi-Purpose Building 6500 South MacArthur Blvd. P.O. Box 25082 Oklahoma City, OK  73125-4933 Note: For overnight mail the ZIP code is 73169 The date and time for receipt of responses is 3:30 p.m. local time, June 18, 2004, (facsimile responses are not permitted).  Any responses received after 3:30 p.m., June 18, 2004, will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendorâ€™s response may be determined unacceptable; therefore, not considered as one of the qualified companies.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary. AMS Clause, 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting, AMS Provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals, and AMS Provision 3.9.1-3, PROTEST, are applicable to this SIR.

<DESC>Draft Sections L and M, and a revised draft Section B is being issued for Introductory Flight Training and Associated Support Services.  Interested offerors are invited to provide comments and questions in reference to these draft Sections in writing to Ms. Gwen Mills (gwen.mills@randolph.af.mil) with a copy to Ms. Cindy Hall (cindy.hall@randolph.af.mil).  Comments are also requested on the following: 1) Is a 90-day mobilization period adequate?  2)  Are there areas of the contract performance that might be incentivized?  3)  Is the planned student load ramp-up as described in the Work Load Estimate too slow, too fast, or just right?  4)  What is the preferred contract type?  Offerors are advised that Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contracts are limited to 5 years, and multi-year contracts are limited to 8 years.  5)  Is a multi-year or multiple year contract preferred?  Multi-year contracts are defined as “a contract for the purchase of supplies or services for more than 1, but not more than 5, program years. A multi-year contract may provide that performance under the contract during the second and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the appropriation of funds, and (if it does so provide) may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if appropriations are not made.” (FAR 17.103).  The key distinguishing difference between multi-year contracts and multiple year contracts is that multi-year contracts, defined in the statutes cited at FAR17.101, buy more than 1 year’s requirement (of a product or service) without establishing and having to exercise an option for each program year after the first.  Multiple year contracts are those that have a yearly option that must be exercised, usually, but not always, on the anniversary of the contract award.  Please submit comments and questions to Ms. Mills and Ms. Hall NOT LATER THAN 18 JUNE 2004.  Additionally, there will be a pre-proposal conference on 23 June 04 at 0800, and Industry Day on the afternoon of 23 June, and all day 24 June, if necessary.  Interested offerors should indicate in writing whether or not they will attend one or both meetings.  Industry Day one-on-one appointments will not exceed one hour, and are required to be scheduled in advance with Ms. Mills.  PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE AND INDUSTRY DAY ATTENDEES MUST INDICATE THEIR ATTENDANCE NOT LATER THAN 15 JUNE 2004.

<SUBJECT>Approach to Procure the Design and Fabrication of Rolling Stock (Escort Cars) for the OCRWM Program
<DESC>NOTICE OF PROGRAM INTEREST SUBJECT:  Approach to Procure the Design and Fabrication of Rolling Stock (Escort Cars) for the OCRWM Program AGENCY:   U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management _____________________________________________________________________ SUMMARY The Department of Energy (DOE) is issuing this Notice of Program Interest (NOPI) to obtain input from rolling stock vendors as the DOE develops approaches to procure the design and fabrication of escort cars for shipping spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level radioactive waste (HLW) to a monitored geologic repository (MGR) at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  DOE is responsible, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), for accepting and transporting spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear reactor sites and high level waste and spent nuclear fuel from DOE federal facilities for ultimate disposal. The DOE is considering the design and fabrication of the rolling stock needed to ship SNF/HLW to the MGR.  The required rolling stock includes cars to carry the containment casks, escort cars to accommodate personnel accompanying the trains, buffer cars to provide a physical separation between cars carrying SNF/HLW and those occupied by personnel, and locomotives to haul the cars. An overview of the program, including the anticipated project schedule, is provided in Appendix A.  Currently, escort car procurement is on the critical path. With this notice, the DOE is seeking comments from vendors concerning the appropriate structure for an escort car procurement process that meets the objectives of the spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste management program and is attractive to potential bidders. Your comments will help DOE refine the process and will provide a basis for the discussions with vendors in the initial stage of the process described below. This notice applies solely to Escort Cars.  Further details of the anticipated requirements for the Escort Cars may be found in Appendix B.  It is anticipated that DOE will select two vendors, each to complete the design and fabrication of a prototype car, test their respective prototype cars at the Transportation Test Center in Pueblo, CO and obtain certification of their designs by AAR. It is then anticipated that both vendors will be invited to submit proposals for final design and fabrication of a fleet of up to thirty (30) Escort Cars in accordance with the certified designs. The DOE is planning to conduct this procurement in the following stages: 1. Meetings with individual vendors (July 2004) DOE will schedule meetings of up to two hours each with individual potential vendors for the design and fabrication of rolling stock.  These meetings will allow companies to share information with the DOE and obtain clarification of any of the issues outlined below.  Potential vendors may distribute written information regarding their products and capabilities for use during the meeting, and collect it at the end of the meeting.  If proprietary information is left with the DOE, the pages that are considered to be proprietary should be either stamped or a header placed on the pages to identify those pages. The two-hour meetings will be held in June/July 2004.  Vendors are allowed to bring no more than five people. The meetings will be held in the Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, Washington, D.C.  The meetings will be scheduled with the point of contact identified on your letter of interest. 2. Draft RFP (late 2004). It is anticipated that the DOE will publish a Draft RFP on the FedBizOpps website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/) for formal comments from the potential vendors and other interested parties. 3. Pre-Solicitation Conference. The DOE is planning to hold an open-forum meeting for all parties interested in this procurement in late 2004.  The final time, place and other details will be announced on the FedBizOpps website and by email to points of contact identified during the initial vendor meetings. 4. Final RFP (early 2005). It is anticipated that the DOE will publish the final Request for Proposals on the FedBizOpps website for vendor response. 5. Award(s). It is anticipated that the DOE will select a vendor or vendors in 2005. The DOE is interested in vendor comments on the following issues. 1. Criteria for selecting design fabrication vendors.  The DOE has initially identified the following selection criteria: - Technical capability to develop designs matching the unique characteristics of the Escort Cars - Cost-effectiveness of the design in fabrication, operation, and maintenance - Ability to obtain certification for the new designs - Corporate experience/past performance/record of integrity - Corporate financial capacity and stability - Key personnel - Ability to meet schedule requirements Is this set of selection criteria sufficient? Do you suggest modifications or additions? 2. Phases of the procurement.  The DOE is considering this procurement of escort cars to occur in two phases: a. Car Design / Prototype Fabrication and Testing:  At least two contractors shall individually provide a detailed design, fabricate a complete prototype, complete analysis and testing at the Transportation Test Center (Pueblo, CO) to demonstrate the conformance with AAR Standard S-2043, and obtain a certificate of compliance from AAR.  A copy of this AAR standard is provided in Appendix C.  The design shall also demonstrate quality attributes, safety and security provisions, performance characteristics and the operations and maintenance concept. b. Production: Contractor(s) selected from those that have completed the Car Design / Prototype Fabrication and Testing phase shall provide a final design incorporating any changes required to obtain certification, as well as final interior design, and shall fabricate the number of cars specified by DOE. Is this procurement phasing appropriate? Would another approach be advisable? If so, please describe. 3. Please address the optimal business, contractual and pricing arrangements that should be employed to meet design, prototype and fabrication requirements for these cars.  In particular address the following: - How can competition be maximized throughout the design/prototype/fabrication process? - As an alternative, is it feasible and/or advantageous to procure a design followed by separate contract(s) for prototype and fabrication? 4. Contract pricing.  Do you have comments with respect to suitable pricing arrangements?  DOE anticipates the use of Firm-Fixed-Price contract vehicles for all contract actions and phases.  Would another approach such as time and materials or cost reimbursement be more appropriate for a particular phase? What pricing terms allow for an equitable sharing of risk on each phase? Does your Firm possess a government-approved accounting system that will allow the use of cost reimbursement contracts? In addition to addressing these questions please feel free to provide any other relevant input or suggestions regarding contract-pricing terms. 5. Information requirements. What type of technical and commercial information do you need to enable a complete and competitive proposal to be submitted? 6. Collaboration. To support Program¡Vwide objectives, contractors may be required to collaborate with other vendors on a given task or requirement, i.e., all vehicle testing.  Please address how this collaboration and integration may be achieved. Also, identify the business considerations with other Rolling Stock vendors that might limit the level of collaboration. 7. Performance incentives. Please describe incentives that could be employed through a contract to encourage excellent performance, compliance with schedule requirements and cost reductions.  Where possible please discuss: - The metrics that should be employed. - The frequency and method of data collection associated with metrics. - Positive or negative financial actions associated with the metrics. 8. Regulatory requirements.  Please identify any technology or regulatory challenges or barriers associated with the design, development and fabrication of the Escort Cars. In particular, address the impact of AAR Standard S-2043 on the design and production of the Escort Cars, whether as an adaptation of an existing design or a completely new design. 9. On-going design efforts. Please identify any on-going design efforts directed toward the development of new or modified rolling stock that could be employed to meet the required  AAR Standard S-2043 and Escort Car and consist functionalities. Appendices for this notice may be obtained by contacting Reggie James at reggie.james@rw.doe.gov. Please provide your responses to the above questions by email in a Microsoft Word file to reggie.james@rw.doe.gov no later than June 21, 2004.  Please limit your comments and responses to no more than 10 pages. No proprietary data should be included in data file that is submitted to the DOE. Please also complete the form in Appendix D as soon as possible and return by email to reggie.james@rw.doe.gov United States Department of Energy Office of Business Support Attention: Reggie R. James, RW-31W 1000 Independence Avenue Washington, DC  20585

<SUBJECT>R -- Aquisition Logistics and Business Management Services
<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the revision of the contract ceilings on the Acquisition Logistics Management and Business Operations Support (ALMBOS) contracts supporting the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  These contracts are two multiple-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts awarded on 5 December 2001.   .  Accordingly, this action will increase the current contract ceilings by $180M from $120M to $300M on each of these contracts .    These contracts contain a base period and four ordering periods (5 years) plus three award term incentive periods—each one year in duration.    Final expiration date of the last ordering period is 30 April 2007 and if earned the final incentive period would end on 30 April 2010.  It is necessary to increase the ceiling due to (1) unanticipated high level of support for the war-onterrorism as a result of the events of September 11, 2001 (9/11); and (2) the USSOCOM mission change based on the events of 9/11.  All work to be performed under the contract is considered to be in accordance with the original statement of work; however, the war-onterrorism increased the amount of work to be accomplished to an amount not contemplated in the original ceiling price.  As a result of the requirements placed against these contracts supporting the war-on-terrorism and due toUSSOCOM mission change, the original established contract ceiling of $120M is expected to be reached in contract year four.   An increase in the ceiling will provide for continued critical support of various projects for the USSOCOM.  The increase will ensure sufficient contract ceiling is available for any award term incentives earned by the industry partners and for new tasks supporting the USSOCOM mission.     A competitive follow-on acquisition is planned to replace these contracts when they expire on 30 April 2007, unless the award term incentive periods are earned, in which case 30 April 2008, 30 April 2009, or 30 April 2010 will be the expiration date.  All task orders processed under the ALMBOS contracts are and will continue to be competed using fair opportunity procedures between the two ALMBOS contractors unless a fair opportunity exception in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies (logical follow-on).    The two ALMBOS contractors and numbers are: Sverdrup Technology, Inc. under USZA22-02-D-0014 and Gemini Industries, Inc. under USZA22-02-D-0015.  The expected date of executing this action is 15 June 2004. See numbered note 22.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Equipment for Port Interface Modular Upgrade
<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - Center for Federal Investigative Services (CFIS) invites you to submit a quotation in response to the requirement within this Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This is a competitive procurement action limited to selected contractors under the General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment Software and Services, (Schedule 70, 132 8 - Purchase of Equipment) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). OPM-CFIS has a requirement to upgrade a Neax 2400 Port Interface Module (PIM) within the facility.  The upgrade will be from a 4 PIM stack to a 5 PIM stack configuration.  It is anticipated that the majority of the parts required to complete this upgrade will be available under the FSS.  Therefore OPM-CFIS intends to award one combined delivery/purchase order to satisfy this requirement.  Offerors are encouraged to discount their schedule pricing below their specified FSS pricing.  Please include a copy of your FSS pricing with your quotation.  Please submit FOB Destination pricing for items not covered under an FSS contract.  Additionally, pricing for items not covered under an FSS contract shall be as low as or lower than those provided to the contractors most favored customers. The Government will award a combined delivery/purchase order to the FSS Contractor that submits a quotation that is responsive to the requirements of this RFQ and offers the best value to the Government.  Pricing, terms, and conditions are subject to Part 8 - Required Sources of Supplies and Services and/or Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items located within the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  The Government will consider price, delivery time, technical support capabilities, and knowledge of the Government requirement when making its best value determination.  All factors will be given equal consideration in the evaluation process.  The Government will use price analysis to evaluate non-FSS pricing and pricing for items not covered under an FSS contract to determine price reasonableness and the offers ability to satisfy the Governments requirement.  Additionally, the price quotations shall be evaluated to determine completeness (responsiveness in providing all RFQ requirements).  To assist in determining price reasonableness, the Government may verify the quoted pricing. To receive a copy of this RFQ or if you have questions regarding this RFQ announcement, you may contact Mr. Brad Holtzapple via e-mail or fax. E-mail address is bradley.holtzapple@opm.gov.  Fax number is (724)794-1152.  Quotations in response to this RFQ are due no later than 2:30 PM, eastern daylight savings time, June 24, 2004.  Quotations received after this time and date will not be considered unless it is determined to be in the Government's best interest to do so.  Quotations may be submitted via E-mail, fax, or mail.  Mailed quotations should be sent to OPM-CFIS, 1137 Branchton Rd., P.O. Box 618, Boyers, PA, 16018-0618, Attn:  FASB/Brad Holtzapple.

DFAR 252.204-7004, (NOV 2001), Required Central Contractor Registration, (a) Definitions. As used in this clause (1) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary DOD repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DOD. (2) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) Data Universal Numbering System +4 (Duns+4) number means the Duns number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern.

The system will be used to conduct radiant intensity measurements of a target within the field of view (FOV) of the camera in contrast to the background intensity. The system must operate over a wide dynamic range to include measurements of constant target intensities (e.g. ships, aircraft) as well as the rapidly changing signatures of other devices such as decoys. In addition, the system will be used to conduct obscuration measurements. The Contractor must provide a standard commercial warranty and associated operating manuals. The basic system minimum requirements are as follows: 1. The system must include a 14 bit midwave infrared (MWIR) focal plane array (FPA) sensor to cover at least the 2 through 5 micron band with a minimum of 320x256 pixel resolution and must not require liquid nitrogen cooling. 2. The system must have the capability to be calibrated and traceable to a blackbody reference. 3. The system must be able to provide real-time imaging, which is defined for these purposes, as a continuous display of the digital image as the image is collected so that moving objects in the scene can be tracked. 4. The system must be portable and reasonably rugged to withstand use in the field for off-site testing. The system must be able to store at least 30 minutes of data or more and the data must have the capability to be transferred from the system via a CD writer. The system must have at least one of the following: USB 2.0, IEEE 1394 or ethernet port. The system must also have an additional analog video output (e.g. NTSC). 5. The system must include a MWIR lens to provide a 3 degree field of view (FOV) or less and at least one of the following: 7 degree FOV (within plus or minus 20 percent) or 20 degree FOV (within plus or minus 30 percent). 6.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Biological Control of Noxious Weeds at F. E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming 

Objectives.   The project has two objectives.

1.  To initiate new and enhance existing efforts to control noxious weeds at F. E. Warren Air Force Base (WAFB) through the release and monitoring of plant-feeding insects targeted at selected noxious weeds.

2.  To incorporate biological control of weeds into existing weed control programs, with the primary thrust of enhancing weed control in environmentally sensitive areas which support Colorado butterfly plant, Gaura neomexicana coloradoensis, or Preble’s Meadow Jumping Mouse, Zapus hudsonius preblei (Preble), both of which are threatened species.

Rationale. The proposed project addresses three needs.  First, the project addresses the need to attack noxious weeds on an ecosystem level.  Biological control of noxious weeds at WAFB will benefit neighbors bordering the installation by curtailing the spread of noxious weeds off property, and indirectly provide a source for biocontrol agents that will attack noxious weeds on land in close proximity to WAFB.  Second, it will address the need to integrate control methods for noxious weeds.  By bringing biocontrol agents into this ecosystem an additional control measure will be added to existing programs.  Adding natural enemies of weeds to the ecosystems should disrupt weed growth and may act synergistically with other control measures.  Finally, establishing weed herbivores should reduce the need to use chemical and mechanical control measures by adding a long-term weed management component, especially in environmentally sensitive sites that contain threatened plant and animal species.

Methodology.  The key to any successful weed control program, regardless of the control measures employed, is based on a thorough understanding of the extent of the weed infestation at a site.   Therefore the first goal is to initiate a survey of the noxious weeds at WAFB using obvious and problem areas (OPA’s) known to exist at the site. As an example of a problem area, there are leafy spurge, Euphorbia esula, and Dalmatian toadflax, Linaria genistifolia dalmatica, infestations at WAFB that may impact populations of the Colorado butterfly plant, Gaura neomexicana coloradoensis, a Federally-listed threatened species, which is typically found in wetland, sub-irrigated habitat. In addition, the Preble’s meadow jumping mouse, Zapus hudsonius preblei (Preble), another threatened species is found at WAFB. Wetlands and areas that harbor threatened species cannot be treated with herbicides to control noxious weeds, nor can mechanical control (such as mowing) be used successfully.  Therefore infestations of noxious weeds are difficult to control.

Biological control of these noxious weed infestations would preserve native habitat, avoid damage to threatened species and their habitats, and preclude the use of herbicides, which may impact wetland plants and animals directly (toxicity) and indirectly (removal of desirable plant species) even if threatened species were not a concern.

Therefore, during the summer of 2004, this project will identify known noxious weed and Colorado butterfly plant sites and conduct GPS mapping to develop detailed maps of the extent of the weed infestations and where these infestations may impact Colorado butterfly plant.  In addition, the project will collect plant density and plant height data at each of these sites prior to, or at the time biocontrol agents are released.  This initial mapping and plant data collection is critical in that it establishes a baseline for economic and ecological evaluations in future phases of the program.
 
At WAFB, there are other sites infested with noxious weeds, such as Canada and musk thistle, and spotted knapweed that would benefit from a biological control program.  The project will implement and establish a program using experience and results at Ft. Carson, Air Force Academy, Monument Fire Center (Monument, CO), and Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (near Golden, CO) with these noxious weeds.  Table 1 contains a list of the insects that will be released at WAFB in 2004.

The program has experience in establishing biological control programs for all the noxious weeds at WAFB, and has nationwide contacts, in addition to existing establishments of the necessary insects at Colorado sites.

In any biological control program, there is a three-phase approach to ensure a sound program that achieves the desired reduction in the pest species targeted for control: 

·  Phase One consists of collection and release of biocontrol agents and sampling for establishment.

·  Phase Two takes biocontrol agents that are established in Phase One, and redistributes them into areas where they are not yet established in order to engender high populations of the agents.

·  Phase Three consists of an ecological and economic analysis of the program in terms of how the biocontrol program impacted the pest and the benefits accruing to their establishment in light of standard control practices.  In general, each phase covers three years.

The three phases of a biological control program are not necessarily distinct from each other, but can coincide, depending on the status of a specific biocontrol agent, the number of pests under consideration and the number of biocontrol agents being used in the program.  In the Ft. Carson program, they are currently in Phase Two for field bindweed, musk thistle and spotted knapweed, with biocontrol agents being released and monitored for establishment.  The program is also beginning Phase Three work on spotted knapweed, with remediation efforts and detailed plant reduction measurement that began in the summer of 2001.  Canada thistle is still in Phase One at Ft. Carson, primarily because of the difficulty in establishing insects that have a significant impact on this weed.  However, the program is flexible and will be able to incorporate new insect or mite species as they are made available for release in the United States.

At the Air Force Academy, the fourth year of the program was completed in 2003.  Therefore that effort is in Phase Two.  Biocontrol agent establishment is confirmed on Canada thistle, knapweed, musk thistle, and leafy spurge insects, and redistribution is underway.

Releases of biocontrol agents at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site began in the summer of 2001.  Some aspects are in Phase One, and others in Phase Two, namely field bindweed and Dalmatian toadflax.

An effort at WAFB fits in very well with existing projects in Colorado.  Beginning in the spring/summer of 2004 a release program consisting of redistribution of insects established at Ft. Carson, Air Force Academy, and possibly Rocky Flats can begin.  In actuality, this would be part of the spotted knapweed Phase Two effort at Ft. Carson. They would also begin a Phase One program on toadflax at F. E. Warren AFB with the toadflax moth, Calophasia lunula, which is available from the Colorado Department of Agriculture.  The toadflax stem boring weevil, Mecinus janthinus, is another candidate species that should be available for the first time in the summer of 2003.   Leafy spurge insects, with which there has been great success at the Air Force Academy sites, consist of Aphthona sp. flea beetles.  Redistributions of Aphthona sp. beetles from Air Force Academy sites and other sites in Colorado to which there is access, to WAFB will begin as soon as the beetles emerge in the summer of 2004.
 
At WAFB there are infestations of hounds tongue and purple loosestrife.  These noxious weeds are new to the program, however biocontrol agents do exist for both plants, and the program will secure and release agents in 2004 at the appropriate time.  The candidate species are listed in Table 1.

Concurrently with the release of the biocontrol agents, the program will collect plant data to set baselines for each OPA where releases are made.  The program will measure plant density along transects through the infestations, measuring the density of plants per meter at 10-meter intervals, and plant height at these same intervals.  This sampling scheme has worked well in the past at Colorado sites.

The program acknowledges that threatened plant surveys must be taken with great care, and they are familiar with previous and ongoing research at WAFB with regard to Colorado butterfly plant (Munk and Hild 2000, Brown and Tuthill 2001).  All surveys will be made with regard to the preservation of Colorado butterfly plants and their habitat, and the program will ensure the efforts do not interfere with other projects.

The program also acknowledges that native thistles are present at WAFB.  Native thistle species know to occur in Laramie County include prairie thistle, Cirsium canescens, and Flodman’s thistle, C. flodmanii.  Other species that may occur in Laramie County include fewleaf thistle, C. remotifolium, Wyoming thistle, C. pulcherrimum, and yellowspine thistle, C. ochrocentrum.  During the course of the project, the program will identify and record the occurrence and densities of native thistles.  The program will also record the impact of any biocontrol agents on these species.  Impact is expected to be minimal because of phenological asynchrony between native and noxious thistles at the time when the plants are attacked by the biocontrol agents.  However, the program realizes some insects may attack a native thistle species, and therefore they are at present conducting a risk assessment of noxious thistle biocontrol at WAFB.  This assessment will be restricted to the thistle species since knapweed, leafy spurge, toadflax, and other weed species encountered will not have associated native species that are closely related.  The risk assessment will focus on biological control of noxious thistle species in terms of the potential damage noxious species may do to native species, the impact of herbicide and mechanical control of noxious thistle species on native species, and the environmental and economic cost of doing nothing to control noxious thistle species.

With regard to the assessment of biocontrol agent establishment, the program will survey the OPA’s in the fall of 2004 for establishment where possible.  The insects and the target weed species have differing phenologies, and specific data collection times will vary.  For example, the program can determine successful establishment of Urophora sp. flies on Canada thistle in the fall by examining seed heads (U. affinis) and stems (U. cardui) for galls and pupal overwintering chambers.  However, Aphthona sp. beetle establishment on leafy spurge, or Calophasia lunula establishment on toadflax, will not be known until the spring and summer of 2005.

Biological control of noxious weeds is an important aspect of overall noxious weed control programs.  In many instances, however, biological control is misunderstood.  It is oftentimes considered a novelty or is placed lower on the list of control measures because it is a slower control measure than herbicides.  There is a great need for education in the intricacies of biological control of noxious weeds.  By including student workers in this program from the start, new personnel from various backgrounds will be trained about biological control of weeds.  The methodologies for this objective are rather straightforward.  Student workers will be included in all aspects of the program.  Student workers will be trained to recognize the noxious weeds and other plants, including Colorado butterfly plant.  These student workers will be present when releases are made, and they will take plant density and height samples from the OPA’s.  Over time, these personnel will assist in sampling for establishment of insects at the OPA’s.

Evaluation.  The success of the project begins with establishment of the insects on the target weeds.  From this point, success will be based on evaluations taken at various times over the course of the program. The program can be evaluated both short and long term.  The surveys of OPA’s and plant parameters within the OPA’s will serve as the baseline for evaluations in the future.  As the insects become established, increase, and begin to damage or kill plants within an infestation, the program will be able to track their progress.  Progress assessments will include: 1. reduction in the overall size of the weed infestation; 2. decrease in plant density, height, and other parameters such as numbers of seedheads per plant; and 3. increase the insects per unit area (which will vary depending on the insect and weed species).  In addition, as weed infestations decline, it will be important in the long term to evaluate the cost (economic and ecological) associated with this program, the use of herbicides alone, and the cost if nothing had been done to reduce or eliminate these weed infestations. Of particular importance to WAFB will be an evaluation of the status of Colorado butterfly plant in declining or noxious weed infestations.

 [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.
