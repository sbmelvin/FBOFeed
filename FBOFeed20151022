The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid Atlantic, Public Works Department Maine, is seeking eligible business firms capable of performing a construction contract to provide services for HVAC Controls, build out of control centers, establishment of a communications network and integration of DDC and industrial controls systems at various locations on Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Kittery, ME.

This solicitation is being advertised as a total small business set aside. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 11/08/2015.  The procurement method is Sealed Bidding, FAR Part 14.
  A proposal due date of approximately 12/08/2015 is anticipated for the subject project.

Project description:  

Regional Operations Center: The intent of this portion of the project is to reduce total energy consumption in 25 buildings at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY) by connecting their HVAC control systems to an Industrial Control System (ICS) for remote control and monitoring. Buildings within the scope of this project without existing Direct Digital Control (DDC) systems will have new systems installed to monitor and control HVAC equipment. Those buildings with existing controls will be upgraded for integration with the new controls system. The buildings will be integrated into an ICS for remote control and monitoring at the Regional Operations Center (ROC) located in B374.
   In addition to integrating the DDC systems in these 25 buildings, the existing Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks will be networked to the ROC in B374. This will provide monitoring of these networks alongside the new DDC network.

 
Period of Performance:  The anticipated contract completion date for this construction project is 500 calendar days from date of award.

Contract Magnitude:  The magnitude of this construction project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.00 IAW DFARS 236.204.  The Northern American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 238210

Special Standards:
A minimum of two (2) projects in the past five (5) years doing installation and integration of HVAC equipment and HVAC control systems in multiple buildings (20 or more) within an existing, operating campus setting (e.g., industrial, manufacturing, collegiate).
 Detailed information will be available in the coming contract solicitation.

<DESC>This procurement is for a multiple award construction contract (MACC) and is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition, with two or more contracts reserved for highly qualified small businesses, as permitted by FAR 19.502-4. This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the best value, price and other factors considered. Price evaluation preference will be given to HUBZone firms, in accordance with FAR 52.219-4.
 This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, repair, and renovation, by design-build or design-bid-build, of waterfront structures and dredging at various locations predominantly within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility (AOR) including but not limited to California, but will be available to the NAVFAC Atlantic AOR as approved by the Contracting Officer.
 However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in Southern California. Types of projects may include, but are not limited to:  dredging and disposal, piers, wharves, quay walls, bulkheads, relieving platforms, cellular structures, dry docks/caissons, break waters, fixed moorings, docks and marinas, pile driving, primary and secondary fender systems, sheet piles, and sea walls. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, and the annual size standard is $36.5 million. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $240,000,000.
 The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order. Task orders will range between $50,000 and $20,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. Each task order issued under this MACC valued at $10,000,000 or less will be set aside for the small business MACC holders whenever the rule of two is satisfied for that task order. If the rule of two cannot be satisfied on a task order valued at $10,000,000 or less, the task order will be solicited to the entire MACC contractor pool. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract.
 Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  Phase One:  Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2 - Experience, Factor 3 - Past Performance, and Factor 4 - Safety; Phase Two:  Factor 5 - Technical Solution, Factor 6 - Small Business Utilization, and Factor 7 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001). Source Selection procedures will be used, and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. No site visit will be held, and no pre-proposal conference will be conducted.
 THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about January 20, 2015. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE DAILY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION. Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above. A sources sought notice (N6247314RWATR) for this procurement was posted on June 4, 2014 on NECO and FBO, and a market survey was conducted that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms.
 As a result of the market research analysis, a determination was made to solicit this procurement on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition, with two or more contracts reserved for highly qualified small businesses. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) San Diego District Office and the NAVFAC SW small business office concur with this decision.

ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control
activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification
procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having
jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requires
Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight
critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to
support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously
approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required
for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed
pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must
submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the
NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures
listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair:
www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or
similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for
source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your
offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source
approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the
Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this
solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted
hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the
ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award
of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP
WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at:
"https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx". Drawings are not available.

<a href="mailto:Jeffery.Thomas@va.gov">Jeffery.Thomas@va.gov</a>
<DESC>SERVICES REQUIRED: This solicitation is for a Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) for providing Primary Care and Mental Health Services in a private hospital, office or clinic environment to Veterans primarily residing in Beaver County, PA.  The Parent Facility for this CBOC is the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (VAPHS), located 37 miles from Beaver County, the place of performance.  Unless otherwise noted, hereafter within this document, singular terms such as "CBOC," "clinic," or "Contractor's facility" shall refer to the Beaver County CBOC.  The Contractor shall provide a community-based outpatient clinic solely dedicated to Veterans.  Primary Care services will provide a continuum of care from prevention to diagnosis and treatment, to appropriate referral and follow-up.  Those patients needing specialty or follow-up care shall be referred to VAPHS.  The CBOC must have the necessary professional medical staff, diagnostic testing and treatment capability, and referral arrangements needed to ensure continuity of health care.  Primary Care services include longitudinal outpatient medical care for the purposes of prevention and detection of disease and subsequent management of medical conditions, for Veterans deemed eligible.  The care will be provided by primary care providers who may be general practitioners or general internists or their authorized designees.  The proposed CBOC, at a minimum, shall provide one standard of care that must be consistent, safe and of high quality.  Additionally, the proposed CBOC is expected to comply with all relevant VA policies and procedures, including those related to quality, patient safety, and performance.  The CBOC must be poised to respond quickly to VA policy and procedure changes.  If requested or required by either the government or the Contractor, the Contractor will work closely with the Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to modify the contract expeditiously, in order to limit the impact on the clinic's Veterans and ensure consistency with the care provided by the VA's other Primary Care Clinics. 

Scheduled initial or follow-up visits to primary care providers at the CBOC site. A complete history and physical examination which includes cervical cancer screening for women (including one of the following Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes: 99203-99205; 99213-99215; 99243-99245; 99385-99387; or 99395-99397.) must be performed on the first visit other than in exceptional circumstances.  This is a Vesting CPT Code visit.  Exceptional circumstances means the Veteran is seen for his/her first visit as an emergency for a shorter duration visit.  In this case, a complete history and physical examination must be completed within the next two (2) months or before the end of the VA Fiscal Year (September 30), whichever comes first.  The complete history and physical examination will be performed with documentation of Veteran problems via the on-line Problem List option in the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA)/Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) computer system which will be updated as needed on each subsequent visit.  The Problem List is to be updated by the third visit and all subsequent visits, and include all significant diagnoses, procedures, drug allergies, and medications.  Within twelve (12) months of the last visit, the Veteran must receive a visit which justifies any of the Vesting CPT Codes.

Offers will be considered only from offerors who are regularly established in the business called for and who, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, are financially responsible and able to show evidence of their responsibility, ability, experience, equipment, facilities, and personnel directly employed or supervised by them to render prompt and satisfactory service in the volume required for all items under this contract. By the signing of this offer, offeror is certifying that he/she shall meet all requirements of Federal, State, or local laws, codes, and/or regulations and all applicable standards in the most current version of The Joint Commission Accreditation Manual for Hospitals, or equivalent accrediting body, regarding the operation of this type of service. 

Any subcontractor utilized by Contractor for the provision of services required under this contract must meet the same qualifications specified herein for Contractor, as appropriate to the work being performed.  Contractor must obtain prior approval from the Contracting Officer for subcontractor(s) utilized.  

In an effort to achieve socioeconomic small business goals, depending on the evaluation factors included in the solicitation, VA shall evaluate offerors based on their service-disabled Veteran-owned or Veteran-owned small business status and their proposed use of eligible service-disabled Veteran-owned small businesses and Veteran-owned small businesses as subcontractors.  The offeror agrees, if awarded a contract, to use the service-disabled Veteran-owned small businesses or Veteran-owned small businesses proposed as subcontractors in accordance with 852.215-70, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors, or to substitute one or more service-disabled Veteran-owned small businesses or Veteran-owned small businesses for subcontract work of the same or similar value.

Thirty (30) days prior to the contract expiration date, Contractor will certify in writing to the Contracting Officer that all licenses and registrations of personnel employed under this contract are valid and current and will be renewed as necessary during the option period.  Failure to provide this certification may result in a determination not to exercise the VA's renewal option.  Updated copies of all licenses and registrations will be provided to the Contracting Officer annually no later than the contract anniversary date.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>Eglin AFB Range Sustainment</p>
<p>The Department of Defense, United States Air Force (USAF), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), Air Force Test Center (AFTC) is currently conducting market research seeking capabilities statements from potential sources, including small businesses (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned (EDWOSB), Woman-Owned (WOSB), and Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB) small businesses that are capable of performing Range Sustainment Planning of Eglin AFB airspace and ranges and to support the assigned test and training missions by providing Range Planning Technical Support for the Eglin Test and Training Complex (ETTC) and implementing the identified strategies of the Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Integrate all of the on-going planning initiatives (Long Range Weapons (LRSOW) Range Study, Air Traffic Control Modeling, Encroachment Management Plan) in support of specific plan developments supporting the overall Eglin long range vision while mitigating current and preventing future external encroachment and minimizing internal mission encroachment. This support is required to ensure the Complex is organized to support current Test and Training customers while continuing to prepare the facility to integrate BRAC driven mission increases and current tenant mission changes through FY2015-CY2017.</p>
<p>(2) Implement the Landscape Planning Initiative (LPI) requirements resulting from the Final EIS and Operating Agreement with the Florida Forest Service in support of increasing the capacity and capability across the regional landscape.</p>
<p>All interested vendors shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to perform this effort to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. Proposals are not being requested or accepted at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is 541330, Engineering Services, with a size standard of $15,000,000.00. Respondents should indicate their size in relation to this size standard and indicate socio-economic status (i.e. SB, 8(a), HUBZone, EDWOSB, WOSB, or SDVOSB). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR Clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.

<p>Small businesses with only partial capabilities of this requirement are encouraged to submit their capabilities statement demonstrating the portion of the requirement they are capable of providing/performing. This information will allow the Government to identify areas of possible breakout or possible subcontracting opportunities.</p>
<p>Interested sources who believe they can meet these requirements should provide a statement of capabilities that provides the following information related to their demonstrated capabilities:</p>
<p>(a) Contract information and program information describing your capabilities in the past three years relative to the objectives and tasks identified below.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />Datalinks - TSPI
<p>The Department of Defense, United States Air Force (USAF), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), Air Force Test Center (AFTC), is currently conducting market research seeking capabilities statement from potential sources, including small businesses (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned (EDWOSB), Woman-Owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB) small business that are capable of providing datalinks for use in a test and evaluation (T&amp;E) environments. The primary purpose of these datalinks is to transport Time Space Position Information (TSPI).</p>
<p>All interested vendors shall submit a response demonstrating their capability in datalinks, specifically TSPI, to the Point of Contact listed below. Proposals are not being requested or accepted at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is 334511 -- Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, with a size standard of 750 persons. Respondents should indicate their size in relation to this size standard and indicate socio-economic status (i.e. SB, 8(a), HUBZone, EDWOSB, WOSB, or SDVOSB). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR Clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 9:00 A.M. (CST) on 18 November 2015. Direct all questions concerning this requirement to Ms. Margaret Santos at margaret.santos@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current, existing technologies (with possible minor modifications) that can be used to meet the datalink capabilities identified above.</p>
<p>FOUR MISSION AREAS</p>
<p>The Air Force is interested in addressing the capabilities gaps for the transport of critical information from TSPI sources including Global Positioning System (GPS) and inertial measurement units (IMU). Conceptually four types of datalink applications are envisioned:</p>
<p>1. High Dynamic: The High-Dynamic Datalink Transceiver (HD-DLT) will be used as transport for TSPI placed on military aircraft. The HD-DLT will provide a network for transporting high speed bidirectional mission data.<br />2. Low Cost TSPI Datalink: The Low-Cost TSPI Datalink Transceiver (LC-DLT) will be used to equip target vehicles: land, sea, and air. This short range datalink must operate independently or in conjunction with an extended-range datalink. The primary mission of the LC-DLT system is to transport TSPI and user-defined messages between a central test facility and expendable vehicles on the Edwards and Eglin ranges.<br />3. Man Portable: The Man-Portable TSPI System (MPTS) will be used to equip personnel with a communications system consisting of a position sensor and a datalink transceiver. This short range datalink must operate independently or in conjunction with the over-the-horizon datalink. Additionally, the MPTS must minimize impact to the individual required to carry the device(s). The primary mission of the MPTS system is to transport TSPI to include position, velocity, heading and status information, and command and control messages between a central test facility and personnel on the Edwards and Eglin ranges. <br />4. Over the Horizon: The OTH-DLT will provide a network for transporting high-speed bidirectional mission data over long, beyond line-of-sight distances. It will be used as a long-haul solution and must be able to operate independently as well as interface with the Low Cost Data Link Transceiver (LC-DLT), High Dynamic Data Link Transceiver (HD-DLT) and Man-Portable TSPI System (MPTS) via Ethernet connection.</p>
<p>The Air Force is interested in suppliers who understand both the operational systems in place to provide TSPI datalink capability as well as how to improve the datalink-to-user chain of events to improve real-time situational awareness during test and evaluation operations. The Air Force is evaluating all possible solutions sets, including the employment of commercial systems as a provider with datalinks transceivers or systems already in production or developmental datalink transceivers or systems which may mount on future platforms.</p>
<p>DATALINK INFORMATION SOUGHT</p>
<p>For this effort, there are two key mission areas of datalink applications. Each mission area has required characteristics which are considered Key Performance Parameters (KPPs).</p>
<p>1. Airborne Mission:<br />a. Range<br />b. Data Bandwidth<br />c. Spectral efficiency<br />d. Modularity and size</p>
<p>2. Ground/Sea based Vehicle Missions<br />a. Data Bandwidth<br />b. Range<br />c. Spectral efficiency<br />d. Size</p>
<p>The Air Force is considering alternatives in each mission area for acquiring datalinks in support of the Key Performance Parameters (KPP). The system may include datalink hardware follow-on concept, leveraging of planned programmed assets (both ground and airborne-based), and/or shared/purchased systems. Any system technology with a DoD Technical Readiness Level (TRL) less than 7 (each component must have been demonstrated successfully) shall not be included unless responder can show, in the case of the airborne mission environment, a path to flight worthiness.</p>
<p>The Government expects respondents to offer datalink and/or datalink systems to satisfy the KPPs. The government expects a variety of options with accompanying discussion of the pros, cons, risks, and associated trade space for the government to consider. Responses should address the technologies available to deliver a datalink suite as described with supporting information addressing modularity, size, performance characteristics, and accuracy.</p>
<p>The HD-DLT Requirements Document, the LC-DLT Requirements Document, and MPTS Requirements Document, and OTH-DLT Requirements Document, and the Concept of Operations Document will exclusively be available to DoD contractors certified under the Defense Logistic Agencies (DLA)s Joint Certification Program (JCP). Certification under the JCP establishes the eligibility of a U.S. or Canadian contractor to technical data governed, in the U.S., by DoD Directive 5230.25 and, in Canada, by the Technical Data Control Regulations (TDCR). A certification is required by U.S. or Canadian contractors that wish to obtain access to unclassified technical data disclosing militarily critical technology with military or space application that is under the control of, or in the possession of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) or the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND). Contractors must submit a DD Form 2345 to the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, along with a copy of the company's State/Provincial License, Incorporation Certificate, Sales Tax Identification Form or other documentation which verifies the legitimacy of the company. Comments on the draft TRD are being sought from interested qualified vendors for the purposes of clarification of the Government's requirements. For copies of the TRD, contact the Contract Specialist identified below with proof of certification.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is voluntary. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any Government assessments. The Government's assessment of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming requirement resulting into a solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small business, or any particular small business program.</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES STATEMENT: All interested vendors shall submit a capabilities statement that explicitly demonstrates their capability to provide the requirement stated in this notice. The capabilities statement should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirement. The response must not exceed 20 pages.</p>
<p>Small businesses with only partial capabilities of this requirement are encouraged to submit their capabilities statement demonstrating the portion of the requirement they are capable of providing/performing. This information will allow the Government to identify areas of possible breakout or possible subcontracting opportunities.</p>
<p>Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: margaret.santos@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "FA2487-16-X-TSPI, TSPI Datalinks. If this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through e-mail filters at Eglin AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachment. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xsls, or .xls documents are attached to your email.

<DESC>Synopsis: THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE REQUESTING SPECIFIC AND INNOVATIVE RISK MITIGATION SOLUTIONS FOR AN INTERIM CONTRACT REQUIREMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. IT IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY SERVICES, NOR IS IT THE INTENT OF THE MISSION AND INSTALLATION CONTRACTING COMMAND CENTER FORT BRAGG, TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOUGHT.   <br>  <br> Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center Fort Bragg (MCFB), Fort Bragg, NC is seeking preliminary marketing information, from capable and reliable sources who can provide specific innovative solutions that mitigate the inherit risk associated with a procuring services within a very condensed timeframe.  An interim contract is necessary to minimize lapse in services for the time period of March 2015 through March 2016 for awarding task orders in support of the United States Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization (USASATMO).   <br>  <br> Respondents must address risk associated with accelerated short notice requirements, multiple worldwide locations, security clearance and country clearance processing, curriculum and training materials produced in various language and dialects that would typically drive cost risk not offset by competition.   Delays necessitate an interim coverage for a short period of time between lapse of contract and final award and transition to the new contract. Applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611699 with a current business size of $11M.  <br>  <br> No proposals are requested by this announcement; all responses shall be solely in the form of information and materials. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this Sources Sought. Further, the Government is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals or any cost or pricing data. Contractors are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this Sources Sought.  <br>  <br> All costs associated with responding to this Sources Sought will be the sole responsibility of the contractor. All submissions will be treated as business confidential materials, become Government property, and will not be returned. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.FBO.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement. <br>  <br> BACKGROUND:  To provide Security Assistance Training in support of U.S. Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization (USASATMO). USASATMO is a subordinate command under the U. S. Army Security Assistance Command (USASAC), and a Major Subordinate Command (MSC) of Army Materiel Command (AMC).  USASATMO executes the overseas portion of the U.S. Army's Security Assistance Enterprise Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) training and technical assistance mission.  USASATMO plans, forms, prepares, deploys, sustains and re-deploys Continental United States (CONUS) based Security Assistance Teams (SATs) to execute OCONUS Security Cooperation missions in support of Geographic Combatant Command Theater Security Cooperation Programs and U.S. foreign policy (For the purposes herein, the terms  quote mark Security Assistance quote mark  and  quote mark Security Cooperation quote mark  mean  quote mark Foreign Military Aid. quote mark ) <br>   <br> USASATMO staffs teams with active component Army, active component members of other services, reserve component Army, reserve component members of other services and Department of Defense (DoD) civilians. USASATMO will request procurement of contractor services if none of these are available for any given Education and Training or Aviation Training mission.  Specific skill requirements will be identified at the Task Order (TO) level. When it is known that uniformed personnel will not be available, contractor support will become the first option considered.  In other cases, the more rapid reaction time of contractors may be a governing factor in using contractor teams. Education and Training and/or Aviation SATs may be a single Contractor employee, a combination of DoD personnel and Contractor employee(s), or entirely Contractor employees. USASATMO requires a variety of expertise while preparing to deploy a SAT, during the training execution phase and during the post deployment stage of a mission cycle <br>  <br> BROAD DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  Aviation. USASATMO performs a wide variety of specialized aviation missions with multiple standard and non-standard aircraft types and skill sets. FMS customers desire aviation training from a military focused curriculum.  For example, providing senior instructor pilot level certifications, military grade aircraft maintenance and inspections as well as establishing progressive aviation policies and standard operating procedures. The military concentration for training generally limits the pool of potential contractor employees to high-demand military retirees. SATMO-supported aircraft are often either newly fielded or no longer in the U.S. inventory which further reduces the pool of available experts.   <br> Education and Training Requirements. The education concept is designed around small teams, capable of deploying and serving as robust training teams capable of providing specialty services and assisting in building host nation capacity across a broad spectrum of combat arms, combat support, leadership and institutional building subjects. Education services assist partner nations in meeting their near term objectives or assist in developing desired capabilities. Programs of instructions (POI) are customized for particular training requirements including battle staff training, maintenance and supply procedures and concepts, warrior leader development and quality assurance supervision and training. USASATMO missions often require unique skills, qualifications and certifications with particular documentation requirements. Managing OCONUS personnel turnover is made more challenging by these training/qualification requirements. <br>  <br> Interested parties shall submit their innovative solutions for the interim timeframe electronically to SFC Casey Gordon at casey.e.gordon.mil@mail.mil and Ms. Casie Savage at casie.m.savage.civ@mail.mil. All responses shall have the following information contained in the Subject Line of the electronic mail,  quote mark Response to Sources Sought 15-012, USASATMO quote mark . Responses should be sent no later than 0800 (8:00am) Eastern Standard Time on 23 February 2015.  No hard-copy or facsimile submissions will be accepted. Cover letters and extraneous materials (brochures, etc) will not be considered. Responders shall address the specific innovative risk mitigation for this requirement through this RFI in written format via email. Fax transmittals will not be accepted. Personal visits for discussing this notice will not be scheduled.  <br>  <br> If the recipients believe that the Army is unreasonably restricting competition, please contact the Advocate for Competition, Dean Carsello at dean.m.carsello.civ@mail.mil. Concerns must address the title of this requirement, reference this synopsis, and specifically why the respondent believes the Army is unreasonably restricting competition. Any submission that identifies potential risk mitigation will be considered; however, the Government will determine its validity and implementation. <br>  <br>  <br>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT, PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU IS SEEKING INFORMATION FOR THE SERVICES OF A CONTRACTOR WHO CAN PROVIDE THE EXPERT ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE ON THE AMERICAN HOUSING SURVEY(AHS) EDITS, AND DATA REVIEW.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall assist staff and share historical knowledge. The Contractor shall review data and propose solutions to problems with AHS. Historical knowledge and subject expertise shall be conveyed verbally and in writing.</p>
<p>The contractor must have in-depth experience and expertise in working on the American Housing Survey. The latter requires extensive knowledge of the history of the survey as well as day-to-day operations. This contract will enable the Census Bureau to operate at maximum efficiency in order to conduct and make improvements to the survey. The technical expertise and knowledge is essential for the accuracy of the data that the bureau will produce.</p>
<p>The contractor shall:</p>
<p>1. Provide analysis, review, recommendations, reports and other consultations on all AHS related topics<br /><br />2. Provide direct expert advice and assistance in the analysis of the AHS data by examining problems and providing resolutions.<br /><br />3. Review the collection procedures and data</p>
<p>4. Provide edit specification through Spec Editor</p>
<p>5. Run SAS programs for analysis and comparative analysis and reviewing table specifications and numbers until the data are accurate for the production and publication of the AHS<br /><br />6. Provide expertise in the redesign of the AHS for 2015 and for 2017</p>
<p>7. Provide expertise in the transition from the Blaise instrument for data collection to the internet based data collection</p>
<p>8. As needed, provide other related analytical tasks in support of the American Housing Survey</p>
<p>The Census Bureau has determined that AHS experience and knowledge are needed to accomplish the requirements. The Census Bureau has enhanced and worked on the survey and made the transition from a paper instrument to a computer-assisted instrument (CAPI) using CASES and then from CASES to another instrument called BLAISE. Over many years, many legacy systems and subsystems were developed and were not adequately documented. In addition, the Census Bureau's sponsor at HUD wants to revamp the data edit and imputation system, so the extensive expertise, experience, and knowledge will be essential to make this transition to new systems. Thus, the performance of this contract by experienced analysts will mitigate any risks associated with the Census Bureau's ability to complete its scheduled milestones and without impeding its overall mission.</p>
<p>If the Census Bureau is prevented from performing these services, our work would be much more difficult and time consuming. This is since the documentation is not always available and we would have a harder time determining why certain assumptions or actions were taken as the basis for determining what portions of the processing system we should keep, and what systems should be changed to improve processes. This would result in it being much harder to transition from old to new and do it in an efficient and timely manner.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau's plan is that over the next few years, the transition to a newer, better documented system will enable us to better provide information via the American Housing Survey (AHS).</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENTS SHOULD INCLUDE: <br />(1)DESCRIPTION OF THE ORGANIZATIONS EXPERIENCE IN AMERICAN HOUSING SURVEYING</p>
<p>(2)EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE OF STAFF<br /><br />(3)INTERESTED CONTRACTORS SHALL ALSO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION SHOWING YOUR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE PROVIDING SIMILAR EXPERIENCE</p>
<p>RESPONSES MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:<br />(1) NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE ORGANIZATION</p>
<p>(2) TYPE OF BUSINESS (i.e. SMALL BUSINESS, DISADVANTAGED, WOMEN-OWNED, VETERAN-OWNED, ETC.)</p>
<p>(3) POINT OF CONTACT WITH NAME, TITLE, PHONE, FAX AND EMAIL</p>
<p>(4) DUNS NUMBER</p>
<p>(5) CONTRACTOR'S CAPABILITY STATEMENT ADDRESSING THE ISSUES LISTED ABOVE</p>
<p>(6) LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS TO WHO ADDRESSING SERVICES HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED TO, INCLUDE CONTRACT NUMBER, DOLLAR VALUE, NAME AND PHONE NUMBER OF CONTRACTING OFFICER</p>
<p>(7) GSA SCHEDULE NUMBER (IF APPLICABLE)</p>
<p>ALL RESPONSES MUST BE SUBMITTED TO rhonda.m.talbert@census.gov NO LATER THAN (NLT), 2:00 P.M., TUESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2015.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR MARKET RESEARCH AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. ALL INFORMATION SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT MUST BE RECEIVED ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE. RESPONSES TO THIS RFI WILL NOT BE RETURNED. RESPONDENTS WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEW.</p>

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE - SOURCES SOUGHT<br />USSS-SS-16-001<br />Solicitation Number: N/A<br />NAICS Code: 339910, Jewelry and Silverware Manufacturing <br />Small Business Size Standard: 500 employees
<p style="text-align: center;">Description of Services</p>
<p>The United States Secret Services is seeking potential sources to provide custom lapel emblems. Services will include but are not limited to tooling, die manufacturing, stamping, trimming, numbering, and packaging of lapel emblems, in coordination with the USSS's designated staff responsible for the design and ultimate delivery of quality lapel emblems.</p>
<p>The USSS requires two types of lapel emblems: Permanent ("Hard Pin") Emblems, which are die-struck and may have intricate designs (provided by the USSS), are multi-colored, have clear epoxy coatings, and have secure posts and fittings; and, Temporary Emblems, which are stamped, multi-colored lithographic metal tabs/tags using USSS-provided designs and colors. Hard pins require permanent sequential numbering on their reverse sides.</p>
<p>Of critical importance to the USSS are the citizenship and security requirements. Contract work will involve access to sensitive but unclassified data. All personnel working on this project, either as a prime contractor or a sub-contractor, must be U.S. citizens. Documentation will be required to confirm citizenship. No security clearances are necessary for this effort; contractor personnel, however, shall be subject to a limited background investigation. The USSS requires all contractor's personnel who are directly involved in production of the lapel emblems as well as the management team to pass a USSS background check. After review of background checks, a determination will be made of each individual's ability to work on this effort. The contractor will have an opportunity to provide a substitute employee for those employees whose background checks are deemed unacceptable.</p>
<p>One or more USSS representatives will be on-site throughout the stamping, trimming, and numbering phase of the manufacturing process to monitor performance and ensure strict accountability for all lapel emblems. All tools and dies manufactured for the USSS will become the property of the USSS and will be surrendered to the on-site USSS representative at the end of each work day for safe keeping. All waste material accumulated during this phase will be controlled and destroyed by melting in the presence of the USSS representative at the end of each work day. Any additional blanks of the lapel emblems will be turned over to the representative along with the tools and dies at the completion of this phase of the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>The contractor shall establish a restricted area where elements of the manufacturing process including the stamping, trimming, numbering, polishing and carding take place. The restricted area shall be a secure room, a wire cage, or a roped- or cordoned-off area. The purpose of this area is to prohibit unsuitable personnel from accessing the lapel emblems during the manufacturing process.

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE REQ24242SLM
<p>The USDA Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Orient Point, NY, intends to award a procurement of 17 cattle, meeting the following criteria: 6 months old; 400-500 lbs.; and castrated males cattle to Thomas D. Morris, Inc. This animal procurement will be conducted in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 13.106 and 6.303-2. The purchase determination is based on recent herd health veterinary testing verifying the source herd to be vaccinated against Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) (Types 1 &amp; 2), Parainfluenza 3 (PI3), Bovine Respiratory Syncitial Virus (BRSV), and leptospirosis with boosters as necessary, and mannheimia. Cattle upon delivery must be healthy with no overt signs of disease, respiratory disease, lameness warts or ringworm. The nature of the research requires outbred commercial cattle of extremely high health status and free of the listed specific pathogens that would interfere with experimental design and results if the cattle were infected with the pathogens. The cattle must be from a single farm site to maintain similar age, health and genetics and be delivered directly to the USDA Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Orient Point, NY with no other holdings between. We have determined Thomas D. Morris, Inc. to be the only source able to supply the health requirements as well as the number of cattle required for the research. <br />It has been determined that procurement of animals not satisfying the above requirements would be devastating to the ongoing research projects and could negatively impact other ongoing bovine projects at the laboratory facility were the above diseases to be introduced to current research herds. This vendor maintains the high herd health required for our ongoing project and is of an agreeable travel distance as to reduce negative animal impact. The cost has been determined fair and reasonable based on current technical knowledge of fair market value. The anticipated purchase order value is $36,485.00.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotation. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can obtain/provide the required animals. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, sara.l.matchie@aphis.usda.gov. The deadline for the submittal of responses is 8:00 am central time, October 29, 2015.</p>

<DESC>The Cyber Center of Excellence (COE) will conduct a Cyberspace Operations experiment called Cyber Quest to assess emerging technologies against documented Cyberspace and Electronic Warfare capability requirements, inform current capability development and doctrine writing efforts, and understand DOTMLPF impacts. Cyber Quest may also serve as a risk mitigation event that Army acquisition and capability development proponents can leverage to validate selected candidate solutions for participation in larger Army/Joint exercises and experiments (i.e. Army Warfighting Assessments (AWA), the Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment (AEWE), the Joint Users Interoperability Communications Exercise (JUICE) and Network Integration Experiment (NIE).
<p>1. Problem Statement. Current Army research and development efforts have shown that user defined operational pictures (UDOPs) can be developed separately for both cyberspace and the Electromagnetic Spectrum (CEM). Further exploration is now required to identify mature technology options that enable the convergence of those UDOPs to provide commanders with a holistic view of the CEM environment that is tailorable to echelon and user, integrated within the broader common operational picture (COP), and designed to be platform agnostic.</p>
<p>2. Introduction. The Army Cyber CoE is looking for commercial vendors that have cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum (CEM) situational awareness (SA) capabilities to participate in Cyber Quest 2016. One of the primary objectives of Cyber Quest 2016 will be to assess the feasibility of leveraging the program of record Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool (EWPMT) as a foundational platform for a converged CEM SA capability at the BCT level. This will be achieved by integrating current Cyber SA visualization performance metrics, published in the Draft Information System Capabilities Development Document (IS CDD), into the EWPMT. Cyber Quest 2016 will provide vendors an opportunity to demonstrate their (stand-alone) innovative CEM SA solutions and integrate selected capabilities with the EW PMT tool (virtual machine, widget, standardized file/message formatting, etc.).</p>
<p>Cyber Quest 2016 will be executed as a proof of concept experiment conducted in an Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) Tactical Operations Center (TOC) environment. IBCT staff role players (S-3/S-2/S-6) will be incorporated to establish a CEM visualization environment that can be overlaid with the COP to inform the commander on what is occurring in both and determine the impacts on unified land operations. While not deemed criteria, it is envisioned that vendor solutions will display inputs from tactical (cyber and EW) sensors; national, theater, and tactical data feeds; and offer ways to converge those displays to create holistic visualizations of the CEM environment. Cyber Quest 2016 will also explore the concept of using "radios as sensors" to provide input to the CEM SA tool. The CyberCoE will hold an Industry Day event (Date: TBD) for vendors that would like to receive more information regarding the Cyber SA requirement and ideas on notional displays in accordance with the Cyber SA Concept of Operations. *Note: Interested vendors should contact the POCs listed in paragraph 16 for attendance instructions.<br /><br />3. CEM SA Key areas of interest. The most essential elements required to provide a CEM SA solution are listed in paragraphs 2a - 2d below: Visualization, Data Dissemination, Data Outputs and Interoperability. Vendor proposals may address one or multiple areas listed below and should have a mechanism to import those capabilities onto the EWPMT. Note: Cyber Quest 2016 will only focus on understanding what is occurring in blue space (friendly networks and EMS).</p>
<p>a. Visualization.<br />(1) Standard geo-spatial reference maps within future computing environments<br />(2) Customizable at each echelon<br />(3) Export/Sharing of displayed data directly integrated within the overall COP<br />(4) Data output must be interoperable, with respect to the application(s) used for presentation, based upon need and audience</p>
<p>b. Data Dissemination.<br />(1) Push/Pull filtering<br />(2) Standardized data models<br />(3) Web application accessibility through the future computing environment<br />(4) Data aggregation and correlation enabled by future Unified Cloud Data (UCD)<br />(5) Single community-wide architecture and information from tactical sensors</p>
<p>c. Data Outputs.<br />(1) Threats<br />(2) Graphics Control Measures<br />(3) Current Ops<br />(4) Blue System Monitoring<br />(5) Network Damage Assessment<br />(6) Operational and Tactical Variables</p>
<p>d. Interoperability.<br />(1) Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)<br />(2) Use interoperability solution schemas for Web Services (e.g. SOAP, JAVA, HTML, and XML)</p>
<p>4. CEM SA secondary areas of interest. The following areas are considered important to the establishment of a CEM SA solution and should be viewed as additional capabilities to the key areas of interest (as applicable) listed in paragraph 4.</p>
<p>a. Data Storage/Ingest<br />(1) Connected to cyber analytics platform<br />(2) Data normalization and indexing<br />(3) Global and uniform access</p>
<p>b. Cost<br />c. Scalability<br />d. Exportability (e.g. handheld, tablet, etc.)<br />e. Classification (NIPR and SIPR, solution must have the ability to support JWICS at a later time)<br />f. Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)</p>
<p>5. The Cyber COE is also interested in evaluating vendor tactical radio solutions that provide voice and data communications as well as EW protection capabilities. Emphasis will be on tactical radio solutions that can prevent enemy EW capabilities from detecting or disrupting friendly force communications and perform as RF sensors. The technology should demonstrate the capability of displaying RF sensor information on the CEM SA tool. Vendors should convert RF sensor information into message formats that are compatible with those used within the Department of Defense. Examples include the JVMF 6017 standard, KML/KMZ file formats, ISA (Integrated Sensor Architecture), etc. Specific capabilities of interest include:</p>
<p>a. Tactical hand held radios that can operate from 200 - 2500 MHz;<br />b. Tactical radios that have anti-jamming capabilities;<br />c. Tactical radios that automatically discover and operate in unused portions of the electromagnetic spectrum;<br />d. Tactical radios with direction finding capabilities;<br />e. Tactical radios capable of directing antenna energy to avoid jamming;<br />f. Tactical radios capable of (near) silent operation;</p>
<p>6. Key Events: Vendors interested in participating in Cyber Quest 2016 should submit white papers in accordance with paragraph 8. Selected vendors will be invited to brief their capabilities in front of a technology selection committee 8 - 11 Dec 2015. Vendors whose technologies have been selected for participation in Cyber Quest 2016 will be officially notified by email NLT 14 Dec 2015.</p>

d.	Describe your companys experience in designing water treatment plants for natural organic matter reduction, including but not limited to biofiltration and other treatment processes.
e.	Describe companys experience with water treatment operation under a design-build-operate scenario.
2.	Questions for Equipment Manufacturers, Representatives and Process Engineers:
a.	Suggested treatment processes with pertinent technical data sufficient to support manufacturers representations, operational requirements, costs (initial installation and operational), warranties and proprietary information.
b.	Market standard sizes, lay-outs, plans and specifications, space and power requirements, typical and maximum/minimum feed rates, typical replacement or service time requirements, and typical life cycle costs per 1,000 gallons for a water treatment plant of this size/capacity.
c.	Company information, such as socio economic status, size, market share, annual sales, length of time in business, length of time with this specific product.
d.	List of projects using this treatment process.

DESIGN DATA

A.  The CLWTP will serve the Eastern portion of the NGWSP and will consist of a water treatment plant (WTP) and pumping plant.  The Cutter Lateral obtains water from Cutter Reservoir, an existing regulating reservoir on the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project.  

B.  Hydraulic Data
1.	WTP
The WTP will be designed and built for the 2020 demand with the capability of being expanded for the 2040 demand (Table 1).  The influent /effluent difference assumes an approximate 4% required maximum loss through the WTP.

Table 1:  Year 2020 and 2040 water demands
Units	Demand	2020	2040
		Influent	Effluent	Influent	Effluent
MGD	Maximum Day	4.0	3.8	5.6	5.4
	Average Day	3.1	3.0	4.3	4.2
	Minimum Month	2.5	2.4	3.5	3.3

2.	Pumping Plant
Pumping Plant shall be designed for sufficient head (420 feet) to pump water to proposed operating storage tank elevations at the following flow rates (Table 2):


Table 2:  Year 2020 and 2040 pumping plant flow rates
Year	Units
	(CFS)	(GPM)
2020	5.9	2,700
2040	8.3	3,800





C.  Water Quality Data
1.	Raw Water Quality
The source water is a reservoir with a good water quality.  See the 4/6/2015 water sample highlighted water quality results (Table 3).

	Iron	0.14	mg/L
	Manganese	0.002	mg/L
	Sodium	15	mg/L
	Sulfate	45	mg/L

2.	Finished Water Quality
a.	Finished water must meet all USEPA primary and secondary drinking water standards.  
b.	The primary finished water quality parameter of concern is natural organic matter and the resulting disinfection byproduct formation.  This is due to the long distribution system length.  
c.	The finished water DOC concentration will need to be approximately 0.5 mg/L.

D.  Treatment Constraints 
1.	96% overall WTP water recovery
2.	Use of chloramines is not permitted

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), Contracting Division, Systems Section (DITCO/PL8223), 2300 East Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5406, intends to issue a sole source award to Quark Security, Inc. to provide licenses for 1,000 Department of Defense (DoD) Mobility Classified Capability (DMCC) Integrated Commercial Solution (ICS) Secret (DMCC-S) devices.
<p>These licenses must be purchased through Quark Security, Inc. to continue the existing National Security Administration (NSA) approved secure baseline configuration of the classified capability on the device. The DMCC ICS device baseline configurations ensure interoperability amongst the DMCC components providing the following capabilities; device integrity, secure browsing, secure email, secure voice, internet protocol security, virtual private network connectivity, policy enforcement and mobile device management. The license required to meet the DMCC secure browsing capability is specific to the Quark Security Shield application. This application provides a NSA required encryption, managing the device security policies, actively monitoring threats to the device and providing a robust security layer to the entire device, enabling the secure browsing.</p>
<p>The DMCC is a joint effort between the DISA and the NSA. In June 2014, the NSA competitively awarded integration contract, H98230-14-C-0596, to meet the DMCC Program needs. In addition to providing DISA with secure DMCC-S devices, this contract provided for the Quark Security Shield application and associated licensing. However, these licenses expire 30 November 2015 and must be renewed to prevent Information Assurance (IA) security gaps on the device. The Quark license ensures the registered DMCC-S user's device can operate securely.</p>
<p>Quark Security Shield is the only mobile application able to provide device security management and encryption capability, mandated by NSA, to maintain the secure baseline configuration of the classified capability on the device. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>All responsible sources will be considered in evaluating the determination to issue a sole-source contract. Quotations or proposals received in response to this notice cannot be accepted since this synopsis cannot be considered a request for quote or a request for proposal.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to award a firm-fixed price contract in November 2015 with a period of performance of one year.</p>

<DESC>DOCUMENT TYPE: Request for Information  <br>  <br> SOLICITATION NUMBER: W912EP-16-Z-0001 <br>  <br> PROJECT TITLE: Jacksonville Harbor Construction Dredging, 47-Foot Project, Contract A, Bar Cut-3 Through Cut-11, Duval County, Florida  <br>  <br> RESPONSE DATE: 5 November 2015 <br>  <br> CLASSIFICATION CODE: Y - Construction of Structures and Facilities <br>  <br> NAICS CODE: 237990 - Other Heavy and Civil Construction <br>  <br> CONTRACT SPECIALIST: Tedra N. Thompson, (904) 232-2016 <br>  <br> This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI).  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  This announcement will be used as market research to determine industry's capability to perform the work as described below.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.   <br>  <br> NOTE: Invitations for presentation may be extended to further communicate capabilities and performance deliveries of proposed methods.  <br>  <br> The Jacksonville District of the U.S Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is seeking industry input for alternative methods to underwater rock blasting in conjunction with river/harbor deepening.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather industry-wide feedback on equipment and methods that have been developed and subsequently utilized for river/harbor underwater construction projects.   <br>  <br> The proposed Jacksonville Harbor Navigation Project shall deepen the channel from its current 40 foot depth to 47 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) will also widen portions of the river by approximately 100 feet, (see attached Draft Specifications).  Note: The riverbed in the areas to be widened can be as shallow as -10 feet MLLW.  Borings have been completed throughout the channel to assess the material to be dredged and indicate said material consists of unconsolidated sand, silt, clay and rock.  The rock, which consists of limestone, sandstone and siltstone is mostly thin to medium bedded (up to 18 inches thick) and has an average unconfined compressive strength of 2,000 Pounds per Square Inch (PSI) and an average point load strength of 4,000 PSI.  The limestone is fossiliferous and vuggy with vugs up to 5 inches; however, locally the rock can have a strength up to 10,000 psi and can be thick to massive bedded (1 to  greater than  3 feet).  One method to break up the hard and massive rock is underwater blasting, however this method has environmental concerns and specific permitting requirements.  The government is seeking alternate methods to blasting, capable of utilization in an aquatic environment with strong tidal currents to a depth of -51 feet MLLW.  Of particular interest is the noise level (decibels) of the equipment at the impact site.  Alternate methods to blasting should include, but not be limited to, equipment utilized for the removal of underwater rock at minimal noise levels.   <br>  <br> Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00. <br>  <br> If advertised, the solicitation would be issued as a Request for Proposal, Best Value and the resultant contract would be Firm Fixed Price. <br>  <br> No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing a response to this announcement or any follow-up information requested. <br>  <br> Request for Information Requirements: <br>  <br> 1. Alternate methods to blasting which can be utilized in an aquatic environment with strong tidal currents to a depth of -51 feet MLLW. <br>  <br> 2. Alternate methods to noise reduction (decibels) of the equipment at the impact site. <br>  <br>  <br> *Prior to submitting a response to this Request for Information, please thoroughly review the attached Draft Technical Specifications, Plans and Geotechnical Data Report (GDR)* <br>  <br> Responses to this announcement must be received no later than 2:00pm, EST on 5 November 2015 and shall be sent to the attention of Ms. Tedra Thompson via e-mail at  tedra.n.thompson@usace.army.mil.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPRIETARY AND/OR BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL DATA.  NAICS Code is 237990 and the Small Business size standard is $36.5 million.

<DESC>ERDC Contracting Office intends to modify contract W912HZ-15-P-0167 on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b) to Information International Associates, Inc. (IIa), 104 Union Valley Rd, Oak Ridge, TN 37830. IIa is the only source capable of meeting the Government's requirements. ERDC is in need of services to plan and prepare for a workshop on the ERDC Business Vision for 2020. This workshop is a follow-on to the recent organizational business process initiative, BESST (Business sophistication, Employee success, Strategic communications, Superior solutions, and Technology stratagem). The discussion points of the workshop are action items that were developed during the initial creation of the BESST initiative. IIa was the facilitator of the initial workshop when the BESST was created (March 2015) and has been working with each BESST action element to develop this next stage of follow-on action items. IIa conducted the initial analysis of trends and responses to data calls regarding the ERDC Human Capital directorate and to lose that continuity for the ERDC Business Vision 2020 workshop would be detrimental to the workshop and the overall BESST initiative executions. The workshop dates have changed and a modification to the current contract is required to accommodate the new schedule. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 5:00 P.M. CT on 26 October 2015. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Please submit information for consideration by the Government to Melissa.A.Keen@usace.army.mil with the solicitation number referenced in the subject line.

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the ombudsman, [Insert names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and e-mail addresses of Center/MAJCOM/DRU/HQ AFICA/AFRCO/SMC ombudsman/ombudsmen]. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the Center/MAJCOM/DRU/HQ AFICA/SMC ombudsman level, may be brought by the interested party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (571) 256-2395, facsimile number (571) 256-2431.<br />(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br />(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br />(End of clause)<br />GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>

LAW GOVERNING CONTRACTS (MAR 2000) In any dispute arising out of this contract, the decision of which requires consideration of law questions, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be interpreted and determined in accordance with the substantive laws of the United States of America.</p>
<p>4. LEGAL STATUS (MAR 2000) The NAFI is an integral part of the Department of Defense and is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Therefore, NAFI contracts are United States Government contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United States.</p>
<p>5. EXAMINATION OF RECORDS (MAR 2000) <br />This clause is applicable under contracts that are entered into by means of negotiation and where price and costing data are required to support a determination of price reasonableness. This clause does not apply to commercial items or when the contracting officer determines that prices agreed upon are based on adequate price competition.

<p>6. ASSIGNMENT (MAR 2000) The Contractor or its assignee's rights to be paid amounts due as a result of performance this contract, may be assigned. No assignment by the Contractor, assigning its rights or delegating its obligations under this contract will be effective and binding on the NAFI until the written terms of the assignment have been approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>7. GRATUITIES (MAR 2000)<br />a. The NAFI may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under this contract if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the Secretary of the Air Force or his duly authorized representative, that gratuities (in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were offered or given by the Contractor, or any agent, or representative of the contractor, to any officer or employees of the Government or the NAFI with a view toward securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performing of such contract.<br />b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled (i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and (ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or his duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee.<br />c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (MAR 2000) The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.</p>
<p>9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (MAR 2000) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.</p>
<p>10. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (MAR 2000) <br />a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-<br />(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension;<br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below);or <br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).<br />(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.<br />b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.<br />c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br />d. If this contract is terminated for default, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any<br />(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />f. If, after termination, it is determined that the Contractor was not in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (MAR 2000) Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Notwithstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. Acceptance of the supplies or services or a written notice of rejections must be accomplished on or before the fifth working day following delivery of the supplies or services, unless otherwise specified in this contract.</p>

<p>13. PARTIAL DELIVERIES (MAR 2000) - Partial deliveries are not permitted unless authorized by the terms of the contract or approved by the contracting officer.<br /><br />14. PAYMENTS (MAR 2000) - Partial payments will be made when deliveries are authorized or as approved by the contracting officer.

If the NAFI makes payment but such payment fails to include a prompt payment penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is made, penalty amounts will not be paid unless the Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the date of payment.</p>
<p>15. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (MAR 2000) The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof. Contractor further agrees to hold the NAFI harmless from all claims or judgments for damages resulting from the use of products or services listed in this contract, except for such claims or damages caused by, or resulting from negligence of NAFI customers, employees, agents, or representatives. Also, Contractor shall at all times hold and save harmless the NAFI, its agents, representatives, and employees from any and all suits, claims, charges, and expenses which arise out of acts or omissions of Contractor, its agents, representatives, or employees.</p>
<p>16. MODIFICATIONS (MAR 2000) No agreement or understanding to modify this contract will be binding upon the NAFI unless made in writing and signed by a Contracting Officer from the office that issued the contract or its successor.</p>
<p>17. TAXES (MAR 2000) <br />a. Except as may be otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all taxes, duties or other public charges in effect and applicable to this contract on the contract date, except any tax, duty, or other public charge, which by law, regulation or governmental agreement, is not applicable to expenditures made by the NAFI or on its behalf; or any tax, duty, or other public charge from which the Contractor, or any subcontractor hereunder, is exempt by law, regulation or otherwise. If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced.<br />b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract price shall be correspondingly increased.</p>
<p>18. PROOF OF SHIPMENT (MAR 2000) (Applicable to shipments outside the United States through the Defense Transportation System [DTS] and Parcel Post shipments to overseas destinations.)<br />a. Notwithstanding any clause of this contract to the contrary, payment will be made for items not yet received, upon receipt of an invoice accompanied by an appropriate proof of shipment. If shipment is made by insured parcel post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service. Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.<br />b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.<br />c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to (i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.</p>
<p>19. COMMERCIAL WARRANTY (MAR 2000) The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract. The printed terms and conditions of such warranty will be provided to the NAFI with the delivery of any supplies covered.</p>
<p>20. ADVERTISEMENTS (MAR 2000) Contractor agrees that none of its nor its agent's advertisements, to include publications, merchandise, promotions, coupons, sweepstakes, contest, sales brochures, etc, shall state, infer or imply that the Contractor's products or services are approved, promoted, or endorsed by the NAFI. Any advertisement, including cents off coupons, which refers to a NAFI will contain a statement that the advertisement is neither paid for, nor sponsored in whole or in part by, the particular activity.</p>
<p>21. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (MAR 2000) <br />a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices. <br />b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.</p>
<p>22. INVOICES (MAR 2000):<br />a. An invoice is a written request for payment under the contract for supplies delivered or for services rendered. In order to be proper, an invoice should include (and in order to support the payment of interest penalties, must include) the following:<br />(i) Invoice date; <br />(ii) Name of Contractor; <br />(iii) Contract number (including order number, if any), contract line item number, contract description of supplies or services, quantity, contract unit of measure and unit price, and extended total;<br />(iv) Shipment number and date of shipment (Bill of Lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government Bills of Lading)<br />(v) Name and address to which payment is to be sent (which must be the same as that in the contract or on a proper notice of assignment);<br />(vi) Name (where practicable), title, phone number and mailing address of person to be notified in event of a defective invoice; and <br />(vii) Any other information or documentation required by other provisions of the contract (such as evidence of shipment). Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate (one copy shall be marked Original") unless otherwise specified. <br />b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97 177): <br />(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.<br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated. <br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 2O") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates. <br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:<br />(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and<br />(B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received.

<p>25. NON WAIVER OF DEFAULTS (MAR 2000) - Any failure by the NAFI at any time, or from time to time, to enforce or require strict performance of any terms or conditions of this contract will not constitute waiver thereof and will not affect or impair such terms or conditions in any way or the NAFI's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for any breach or breaches of such terms and conditions<br /><br />LIST OF FAR CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE</p>
<p>The provisions of the following clauses set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or DoD FAR Supplement are hereby incorporated into this order or contract by reference with the same force and effect as though herein set forth in full.

<DESC><p><br />COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation ("synopsitation" hereafter), which is expected to result in award of a pre-priced blanket purchase agreement (BPA), etc. for commercial items, as described under the paragraph below titled "Requirement."&nbsp; The synopsitation is prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. An agreement, if any, will be made with the responsible offeror who submits a proposal that (1) conforms to the requirements of the synopsitation; (2) represents the best value to the Government, prices and factors considered. The Contracting Officer may choose to issue multiple awards. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions or make no award at all depending upon (1) the quality of proposals received and (2) the price fair and reasonableness of proposals received.</p>
<p>Synopsitation Number: FA8601-16-A-0001</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 621511</p>
<p>Requirement: The 88 MDG is tasked to perform various lab tests to assist with diagnosing patient maladies. The Government does not have the in house capability to perform all tests required. Services are to be provided in accordance with the Performance Work Statement, which is located at Attachment 1.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer (CO) has determined that a Pre-Priced Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) is the most appropriate method for procuring this requirement. A BPA is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing "charge accounts" with qualified sources of supply. Supplies or services are ordered by placing calls against the BPA by personnel authorized by the CO to make such calls. The contractor provides the supplies or performs the services covered under the BPA IAW the BPA Terms of Agreement at the prices on the price list approved by the CO. The contractor submits price lists for the CO's approval, which are valid for a specific period of time (normally one year); i.e. 16 Nov 2015 through 15 Nov 2020. The BPA will be written for a period of five (5) years, during which the Government is only obligated for authorized purchases made under the BPA. Therefore, a BPA does not include a minimum purchase requirement or maximum dollar limitation. The Government is not obligated to make any calls against the BPA, which may be cancelled by the Government or the contractor in accordance with the cancellation terms specified in the BPA Terms of Agreement. For additional information on BPAs refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.303.</p>
<p>All prospective awardees are required to register in the System for Award Management (SAM) and to maintain active registration during the life of the contract. SAM can be accessed at https://www.sam.gov. Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov. Prior to BPA award, your company must be registered with SAM.</p>
<p>All Contractors must also have a DUNS number. The DUNS number is a nine-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services. If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A DUNS number will be <br />Provided immediately by telephone at no charge to the offeror. For information on obtaining a DUNS number, the offeror, if located within the United States, should call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505. The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations.<br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference.

L. 113-235), Government <br />agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) <br />under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or <br />subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal <br />confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such <br />employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a <br />designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or <br />agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene <br />requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by <br />a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. <br />(c) Representation. By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not <br />require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or <br />abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise <br />restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, <br />or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal <br />department or agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-<br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);<br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (JUL 2013)<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-<br />"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings).

<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes- <br />(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.14; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at http://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(d)(3) that the Service Contract Labor Standards statute- (1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Labor Standards clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or (2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at FAR 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offer, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis. (c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision-    (1) The clause of this solicitation at 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; and (2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation.

52.237-3--CONTINUITY OF SERVICES (JAN 1991)--(a)  The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, upon contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another contractor, may continue them.  The Contractor agrees to (1) furnish phase-in training and (2) exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor. (b)  The Contractor shall, upon the Contracting Officer's written notice, (1) furnish phase-in, phase-out services for up to 90 days after this contract expires and (2) negotiate in good faith a plan with a successor to determine the nature and extent of phase-in, phase-out services required.  The plan shall specify a training program and a date for transferring responsibilities for each division of work described in the plan, and shall be subject to the Contracting Officer's approval.  The Contractor shall provide sufficient experienced personnel during the phase-in, phase-out period to ensure that the services called for by this contract are maintained at the required level of proficiency. (c)  The Contractor shall allow as many personnel as practicable to remain on the job to help the successor maintain the continuity and consistency of the services required by this contract.  The Contractor also shall disclose necessary personnel records and allow the successor to conduct on-site interviews with these employees.  If selected employees are agreeable to the change, the Contractor shall release them at a mutually agreeable date and negotiate transfer of their earned fringe benefits to the successor. (d)  The Contractor shall be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in, phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the agreed period after contract expiration that result from phase-in, phase-out operations) and a fee (profit) not to exceed a pro rata portion of the fee (profit) under this contract.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>
<p>(1) "Defense items," defined in the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778(j)(4)(A), as defense articles, defense services, and related technical data, and further defined in the ITAR, 22 CFR Part 120.</p>
<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>

<p>(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>

<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103.

<p><strong>Question:</strong> For CLIN 0003 - Are you looking for only the vest price?&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three sections that lead me to believe that a vest should include different things ...Under "Classification" in the PD on page 1 it says, "Vest shall be of 1 type in 1 size with 2 expansion panels (assuming 1 small and 1 large)." Under "Accessories" in the PD on page 1 it says, the accessories in the list are for separate/individual purchase. Under 3.3.1 "Vest" it says the vest shall have the sewn-in pockets and various modular removable&nbsp; pockets (General Pocket large and small, &amp; Radio) and then it lists all the "optional" components.<br />For CLIN 0002 - "Base Vest and all Pockets" confirmation. This means the 1. Base Vest, 2. General Pocket Large, 3. General Pocket Small, 4. Radio Pocket, correct?&nbsp; A "system" makes me think it's all items including what's listed in 3.3.2.<br /><br /><em><strong>Response:</strong> "Complete system" (CLIN 0002)&nbsp;and "Airsave vests" (CLIN 0003) both include one (1) of each item depicted in Drawing No. 5-31-100, specifically the following:<br />AF Airsave Vest Sub-Assembly;<br />Label Identification;<br />Horizontal Mounting Panel;<br />Crew Regulator Unit/ Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (CRU/JHMCS) Attachment Assembly;<br />Expansion Panel, 1 Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment (MOLLE) - (Small);<br />Expansion Panel, 2 Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment (MOLLE) - (Large);<br />General Pocket Assembly - Small; <br />General Pocket Assembly - Large;<br />Radio Pocket Assembly; and<br />Helmet Mounted Integrated Targeting System (HMIT) Attachment<br /><br />The government may wish to acquire any of these items individually during sustainment and in follow-on contracts.<br /><br /></em><strong>Question:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>[Contractor]&nbsp;has a question regarding CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0002 ... <span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Shouldn't the FAT be due after the materials are approved by the government? If we are correct in understanding, then we would have additional time after the testing and approval to deliver the FAT garment.<br /><br /><em><strong>Response:</strong> The government is working under an expedited&nbsp;timeframe for this acquisition. For this reason, the government will simultaneously perform testing on materials and the first article provided. Both will be evaluated individually for compliance with the material requirements and pattern compliance respectively.</em></span></p>

<DESC>1.	The purpose of this amendment to solicitation VA247-16-Q-0034 is to modify, correct, and replace Section (iv) of the Combine Synopsis wherein it states that this solicitation is issued as a Small Business set aside.

3.	Section (iv) of the Combine Synopsis Solicitation VA247-16-Q-0034 shall now read:  (iv) This solicitation is issued as a total Small Business set aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 562212 and the size standard is $38.5 million.

4.  	Post Questions & Answers all follows:

1.	Who is the existing vendor on the said subject contract VA247-16-Q-0034 Hazardous Waste Removal?  Tradebe Treatment & Recycling, LLC

2.	What is the contract number? VA247-12-Q-0280

3.	When does the contract expire? 10/31/2015

4.	What is the current contract value?  $79,056.88 (3 YEARS)

5.	Budget spent yearly for the past 5 years on this contract.  Majority of it. Just had a pick up on Monday, so I do not know how much we have left after they bill us.  May few $1000.00 left

6.	Who do we contact for a site visit, email and phone number, and name of the person?  No site visit will be scheduled. 

7.	Could the person or someone could accommodate us on the site visit on the weekend? No. Only Monday-Friday 0800-1600. 

8.	Week days and weekend hours for the said site visit.  No site visit will be scheduled. 
9.	Would your office extend the existing contract for the said subject solicitation of Hazardous Waste Removal if there is no response by your set deadline? Yes

10.	How are these services currently being performed? In-house? Under contract 

11. How much is the total square footage?  Approx. 600,000 sq. feet

12. What are the licenses that are required for the performance?  RCRA/DOT Certified, Certified in all state they transport HW in/to/through/CDL licensed

13.	Has the scope of work increase or decrease since contract award?  Scope of work for this service has remained the same. 

14.	You provided estimated quantities in the solicitation for bidding purposes for each base and option year with a monthly billing amount. In the SOW it states that the amounts or the hazard classes provided could vary. Based on this information, what happens if there are higher volumes than estimated?  Since we are required to bid a monthly sum amount, how would we capture the additional costs?   Our monthly varies dependent upon spills, expired chemicals, etc.  We don't even know exactly what we will have month to month.

15. Is it correct to assume that the total quantity of waste for the particular material to be bid 
on is an estimated yearly amount......  and not the monthly amount to be generated? So the monthly estimated amount of waste to be bid on would be to divide that number by 12 to come up with an estimated monthly amount of waste for bidding purposes? The Statement of Work lists all products that could potentially be disposed up at our facility at any given time.  Not all these items are picked up every month.  Cost is based on previously service and from current market research.  The table in the SOW would be approximate pickups for the full 12 months.

     16.	Please provide the Wage Determination. See attachment 

5.	All other terms and conditions of Solicitation VA247-16-Q-0034 shall remain the same.

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<ARCHDATE>10222016
<CONTACT>Michelle Sanders 619-532-3834
<DESC>This procurement is for a multiple award construction contract (MACC) and is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition, with two or more contracts reserved for highly qualified small businesses, as permitted by FAR 19.502-4. This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the best value, price and other factors considered. Price evaluation preference will be given to HUBZone firms, in accordance with FAR 52.219-4.
 This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, repair, and renovation, by design-build or design-bid-build, of waterfront structures and dredging at various locations predominantly within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility (AOR) including but not limited to California, but will be available to the NAVFAC Atlantic AOR as approved by the Contracting Officer.
 However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in Southern California. Types of projects may include, but are not limited to: dredging and disposal, piers, wharves, quay walls, bulkheads, relieving platforms, cellular structures, dry docks/caissons, break waters, fixed moorings, docks and marinas, pile driving, primary and secondary fender systems, sheet piles, and sea walls. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, and the annual size standard is $36.5 million. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $240,000,000.
 The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order. Task orders will range between $50,000 and $20,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. Each task order issued under this MACC valued at $10,000,000 or less will be set aside for the small business MACC holders whenever the rule of two is satisfied for that task order. If the rule of two cannot be satisfied on a task order valued at $10,000,000 or less, the task order will be solicited to the entire MACC contractor pool. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract.
 Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Phase One: Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2 - Experience, Factor 3 - Past Performance, and Factor 4 - Safety; Phase Two: Factor 5 - Technical Solution, Factor 6 - Small Business Utilization, and Factor 7 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001). Source Selection procedures will be used, and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. No site visit will be held, and no pre-proposal conference will be conducted.
 THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about January 20, 2015. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE DAILY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION. Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above. A sources sought notice (N6247314RWATR) for this procurement was posted on June 4, 2014 on NECO and FBO, and a market survey was conducted that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms.
 As a result of the market research analysis, a determination was made to solicit this procurement on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition, with two or more contracts reserved for highly qualified small businesses. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and the NAVFAC SW small business office concur with this decision.

<p>The Government cannot guarantee any further questions will be answered at this time.</p>
<p>Q1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Has this requirement been set to a final acquisition timeline? Is so can you advise the timeframe? Vehicle?</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A1. The final acquisition timeline is not yet finalized/approved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The TEC contract will be an IDIQ contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Anticipated RFP release in 3rd QTR FY16 and award in 1st QTR FY18</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q2. The previous NAICS Code for this effort was 541330 (Engineering Services).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This RFI for the follow-on requirement uses NAICS Code 541380 (Testing Laboratories).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why the change in NAICS Code?</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A2. While some of the required services are similar to other NAICS descriptions, 541380 has been determined to be the best fitting NAICS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q3. Does the Government envision off-site test requirements?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A3. Testing may be accomplished in Government, contractor, and industry facilities, depending on the type of testing involved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Operational testing is typically conducted with users at their operational realistic locations, developmental testing is typically conducted in the developer's or Government's lab, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q4. Do SB primes require an off-site test lab, or can teammates fulfill any type of off-site test lab requirements?</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A4. No off-site test lab is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q5. We have extensive past performance under 541330 (Engineering Services) that seems to provide the type of support effort needed to support JITC; however, we do not have much experience under 541380 (Testing Laboratories). How important is it to have specific 541380 past performance and would our 541330 experience be considered sufficient for you to consider our firm qualified to bid? Lastly, is there a possibility that the NAICS designation could change to 541330 when the RFP is released?</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A5. All relevant experience will be reviewed, no matter what NAICS it was performed under.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government has determined 541380 to be the appropriate NAICS.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><br />HOW TO OFFER: <br /></strong>The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the 'Open Period'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may submit offers during the 'Open Period'**.&nbsp;Offerors can input information into the application at any time during the month but those changes become active only after they are&nbsp;actually submitted&nbsp;during the&nbsp;'Open Period'. For assistance with the application, email AAAP.Manager@gsa.gov.</p>
<p>The Open Period for <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">November*</strong> is <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">November 1, 2015 to November 20, 2015*,</strong> ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The AAAP will be used to award leases between&nbsp;500&nbsp;and approximately 60,000&nbsp;ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Building/space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period.

<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program November 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>* The open period has been extended through November 20th to allow sufficient time for offerors to familiarize themselves with the new Fiscal Year 2016 RLP and make any necessary changes to their offers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The open period will return to its normal 7-day length in December.</p>
<p><strong>** If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2015, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2016 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Please be sure to review each page prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the 'Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your previous offered space will not be copied.</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">OCCUPANCY: </strong>Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.</p>

<DESC>The project consists of the dredging of portions of the Auxiliary Channels of the Thimble Shoal Federal Navigation Channel and the placement of the beach-quality dredged material along the Chesapeake Bay shoreline of the City of Norfolk, VA between the Little Creek Federal Navigation Channel and the terminal groin at the Tip of Willoughby Spit. The work shall be performed by a hopper dredge with 1,200,000 cubic yards of beach-quality dredged material transported and placed along the shoreline to provide for a protective beach berm with an average width of 60 feet constructed at an elevation of 5 feet above mean low water [3.5 feet, North American Vertical Datum, 1988 (NAVD 88)], with a foreshore slope of one on 20 extending to the natural bottom along the entire 7.3-mile shoreline where an adequate berm does not presently exist. The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract using INVITATION FOR BID WITH PRE-AWARD SURVEY and procedures outlined in FAR 36 and FAR 14. Pre-award survey will determine contractors' responsibility in accordance with FAR 9.104 and 9.106. <br /><br />Bidders will be evaluated on both pre-award survey and conformance to the solicitation and price. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all Bids; and to award the contract to other than the lowest total price and to award to the bidder submitting the lowest bid determined by the Government to be responsible. The contract duration is 365 calendar days. The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $10,000,000.00 to $25,000,000.00. The solicitation will be posted on/about 16 October 2015. The receipt date for Bids is&nbsp;20 November 2015 by 2:00 p.m. NAICS CODE 237990 ($27.5M) applies to this procurement. Bid bonds will be required with bid submittals. Search on W91236% for solicitations issued by Norfolk District. No hard copies will be available. Prospective contractors must be registered Vendors with https//www.fbo.gov in order to download plans and specifications. Prospective contractors must be registered in the DOD System for Award Management (SAM) database in order to obtain access to FEDBIZOPPS. It is incumbent upon vendors to monitor FEDBIZOPPS for the release of the solicitation, specification, drawings, and all subsequent amendments. SAM Registration must also be ACTIVE and current to be eligible for contract award. Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov. Lack of registration in the SAM database will prevent access to FEDBIZOPPS and will make a Bidder ineligible for award. NOTE: Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) apply to this solicitation. With ORCA, vendors have the ability to enter and maintain representations and certification information, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov; therefore, vendors no longer have to submit representations and certifications with bid. Instead, this solicitation contains a single provision that will allow vendor to either certify that all representations and certification in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of signature, or list any changes. <br />

<DESC><p>The work described herein involves the replacement/upgrade of the navigation lock downstream gate hoist mechanical machinery and the associated electrical and control equipment, and the rehabilitation of the gate hoist friction sheaves.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Ice Harbor navigation lock downstream gate is a counterbalanced vertical lift gate and measures approximately 90 feet tall by 88 feet wide and weighs approximately 740 tons. The gate is connected to two counterweights (one on each side) with twelve 2-1/4 inch diameter wire ropes. The hoist machinery is located in two machinery rooms located at the top of the downstream structural towers, one on each side of the lift gate. The wire ropes pass over an 18 foot diameter friction sheave. The friction sheave is driven through an electric hydraulic pump driving a high speed hydraulic motor. The speed is reduced and torque increased through a gearbox having an external pinion driving the gear around the perimeter of the sheave. The wire rope passes over the uppermost surface of the hoist sheave. The two hoist sheaves support the cumulative weight of the gate, the counterweight, and the hoist ropes.</p>
<p>The downstream lift gate hoist machinery is the original machinery installed when the lock was placed into service in 1969, with the exception of a coupling (replaced in 1980), pedestal mounting system (added in 1980), output gear in box (reversed due to bent shaft in 1980), gearboxes and hydraulic system (replaced in 1989), hoist wire ropes (replaced in 2012). Electrical and control systems are original.</p>
<p>Summary of Work</p>
<p>Mechanical upgrades consist of the hoist drive components required to operate the gate, the overhead service crane in each machinery room, and the mechanical aspects of limits and controls for gate operation.</p>
<p>Furnish and install the following items for the hoist drives in each machinery room: new pillow block bearings, ring gears, pinion gears, pinion shafts, pinion bearings, couplings, and brakes. In addition, install new Government furnished gearboxes.</p>
<p>Install new bearings and ring gear for the friction sheaves in each machinery room. In order to replace the friction sheave bearings and ring gears, the contractor must have technical experience, labor, and physical plant required for jacking and shoring of the existing 18 foot diameter friction sheaves that weigh approximately 112,000 pounds each and the counterweights which weigh approximately 740,000 pounds each. Upon completion of the bearing replacement, the contractor will be responsible for precise alignment of the friction sheave bearings and the alignment of open gear contact between the new pinion gears and the existing friction sheave ring gears.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous elements of the contract include RCRA 8 metal based paint and asbestos containing material (ACM) removal and disposal from existing equipment, and reroofing both tower roofs with a liquid applied membrane.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for gate hoist wire rope load balancing that will require the services of a qualified engineer with a minimum of three years experience with load cells and load monitoring equipment to ensure the loads are evenly distributed across all hoist wire ropes at the completion of the work. The overhead service cranes in each machinery room will be replaced with commercially-available four ton rated electric wire rope hoists. New overhead cranes shall be single-girder top running bridge-type furnished with pendant style pushbutton remote control and wall-mounted pushbutton control station. Structural upgrades consist of weld repair of the downstream gate hoist friction sheaves, fabrication and installation of new machinery supports and pedestals, fabrication and installation of new safety handrails, and structural modifications to the existing overhead service crane corbels.</p>
<p>Structural modifications to the existing overhead service crane corbels consist of the installation of an adhesive anchor system to increase the load capacity of the corbels from 5,000 pounds to 8,000 pounds. Evaluate concrete drilling locations for the presence of existing reinforcing steel with Ground Penetrating Radar or an approved equivalent method. Electrical upgrades consist of replacement of the machinery room motor control centers and power supply wiring and circuit breakers, installation of new variable frequency drive (VFD) equipped motors, new main power disconnects, new power distribution blocks, new VFD's, new control voltage transformers, new dynamic brake resistors, new programmable logic controllers (PLC), new network switches, new fiber optic panels, and new control relays.</p>
<p>New PLC installations require the contractor to provide PLC program development, licensed software packages, shop testing, and operator field tests. New VFD installations require specified hardware, programming software, onsite installation supervision by the VFD manufacturer, VFD test plans, and execution of performance verification tests.</p>
<p>New control panel, graphic panel, and equipment panel installations require specified hardware to be verified through Government-witnessed shop testing prior to delivery to the work site. A critical element of the project involves complex sequencing and coordination of commissioning and cut-over of new equipment and systems, and highly technical interfaces between new and old systems. The Contractor must demonstrate experience and qualifications necessary to manage challenging Quality Control and Commissioning programs for both factory and on-site testing requirements. The project involves long lead time procurement of complex electrical and control equipment and fabrication of large mechanical gears. Complete on-site work in close coordination with the Government lock and dam facility, and minimize outages and disruptions to operations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On October 21, 2015, the General Services Administration, FEDSIM on behalf of U.S. Department of Agriculture, Risk Management Agency (RMA) awarded a directed 8a task order pursuant to the exception to fair opportunity process of the underlying&nbsp; 8(a) STARR II Government Wide Acquisition Contract. Please see attached justification and approval for exception to fair opportunity for the applicable authorities. This order falls under STARS II Functional Area 1 (NAICS541511).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The task order was awarded as a labor hour contract type. FAR 16.601 states that a labor hour contract type may be used only if the Contracting Officer determines that no other contract type is suitable. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The work to be performed is such that it is not possible at the time of placing the order to accurately estimate the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of certainty. The full extent of the level of effort required for the development requirements cannot be defined for multiple reasons, including the number of complexities of the application development, testing, and pilot processes associated with the RMA CIO application environment and their required use of RMAgile processes for rapid releases. The applications development environment is dynamic and requires an iterative process, multiple reviews, and constant changes and updates. Additionally, there are numerous uncertainties that are associated with transitioning applications from the development phase to an operations and maintenance environment managed by another party. The highly flexible solution needed to support the unpredictability in the requirements, makes a labor hour the only suitable contract type.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black; mso-themecolor: text1;">Therefore, the Contracting Officer determined that no contract type other than labor hour is suitable for the services on this task order.<strong> </strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Award was made to&nbsp; EOOC Select Inc located at 4100 N. Mulberry Drive Suite 105, Kansas City, MO 64116.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Please find attached: 1. Justification and Approval for Exception to Fair Opportunity</p>

<AWARDEE>Marathon Construction Corporation (DUNS 057868309)
10108 Riverford Rd., Lakeside, CA 92040
<DESC>This procurement is for a multiple award construction contract (MACC) and is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition, with two or more contracts reserved for highly qualified small businesses, as permitted by FAR 19.502-4. This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the best value, price and other factors considered. Price evaluation preference will be given to HUBZone firms, in accordance with FAR 52.219-4.
 This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, repair, and renovation, by design-build or design-bid-build, of waterfront structures and dredging at various locations predominantly within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility (AOR) including but not limited to California, but will be available to the NAVFAC Atlantic AOR as approved by the Contracting Officer.
 However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in Southern California. Types of projects may include, but are not limited to: dredging and disposal, piers, wharves, quay walls, bulkheads, relieving platforms, cellular structures, dry docks/caissons, break waters, fixed moorings, docks and marinas, pile driving, primary and secondary fender systems, sheet piles, and sea walls. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, and the annual size standard is $36.5 million. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $240,000,000.
 The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order. Task orders will range between $50,000 and $20,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. Each task order issued under this MACC valued at $10,000,000 or less will be set aside for the small business MACC holders whenever the rule of two is satisfied for that task order. If the rule of two cannot be satisfied on a task order valued at $10,000,000 or less, the task order will be solicited to the entire MACC contractor pool. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract.
 Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Phase One: Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2 - Experience, Factor 3 - Past Performance, and Factor 4 - Safety; Phase Two: Factor 5 - Technical Solution, Factor 6 - Small Business Utilization, and Factor 7 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001). Source Selection procedures will be used, and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. No site visit will be held, and no pre-proposal conference will be conducted.
 THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about January 20, 2015. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE DAILY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION. Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above. A sources sought notice (N6247314RWATR) for this procurement was posted on June 4, 2014 on NECO and FBO, and a market survey was conducted that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms.
 As a result of the market research analysis, a determination was made to solicit this procurement on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition, with two or more contracts reserved for highly qualified small businesses.

Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Phase One: Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2 - Experience, Factor 3 - Past Performance, and Factor 4 - Safety; Phase Two: Factor 5 - Technical Solution, Factor 6 - Small Business Utilization, and Factor 7 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001). Source Selection procedures will be used, and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. No site visit will be held, and no pre-proposal conference will be conducted.
 THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about January 20, 2015. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE DAILY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION. Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above. A sources sought notice (N6247314RWATR) for this procurement was posted on June 4, 2014 on NECO and FBO, and a market survey was conducted that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms.
 As a result of the market research analysis, a determination was made to solicit this procurement on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition, with two or more contracts reserved for highly qualified small businesses.
