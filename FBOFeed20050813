<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC intends to award on a sole source basis to Air Products and Chemicals the requirement for Developing and Demonstrating a  process to Purify 2,4 Dinitrotoluene (DNT) to be used as a Feed Stock for the  Production of Trinitrotoluene.  This award will result in a 7 month research and engineering effort to produce a process which will raise the purity of commercial DNT to Military requirements.  This action is in the best interest of the Government as it will allow the same supplier who will be able to meet the requirements of the Government.  Transition of the technology from pilot studies to the production facility would be faster and less costly, compared to the development of the process by one supply with implementation by another. POC for this action is Cathy Kallistros, ckallis@pica.army.mil.  See NOTE 22

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

FOR

MOD/JHQ/IAF PERSONNEL DATABSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

1. BACKGROUND:  The Ministry of Defense and Iraqi Armed Forces (IAF) require a personnel database management system to properly manage military, police, and civilian personnel resources throughout the personnel life cycle of accession, training, distribution/assignment, sustainment separation/retirement and accommodate organizational structure changes and development.

2. GENERAL SCOPE. Web based access to an open architecture centrally managed personnel database system for the Ministry of Defense Headquarters (DG Personnel and DG Budget); 10 geographically separated Base Support Units; the Joint Headquarters M1/M8 staff; The Iraqi Army Headquarters M1 staff; 10 Army Division HQ G-1 staffs;, 35 Army Brigade HQ S-1 staffs;, HQ Iraqi Air Force M1 staff;, Iraqi Navy Headquarters and HQ Iraq Special Ops forces.  The system should emulate Army Knowledge on-line, Marine Corps Total Force System, or IBM 3270.  The infrastructure is supported by Iraq Support network (IDN).  This IDN network deployment is phased and the database implementation plan needs to take these phases into account.  The system must be 95% operable based on a 30-day period.  Operability is defined as application level connections.

3. PHASES AND REQUIREMENTS:  This is a two phased project.

a. PHASE 1:  The anticipated Phase 1 duration is no longer than 90-days.   This time frame does not include required in-processing and transportation to and from Iraq.  In phase one the contractor will conduct a requirements analysis which will include consultation with members of the Iraqi Joint Headquarters M1/M8 and MOD DG Personnel and DG Budget Staffs, and MNSTC-I J6/J1/J8.  The contractor will submit a written proposal to MNSTC-I J1 that details all equipment, software licenses for 3 years, and service fees associated with this project.  The written proposal must also include the following requirements.

i. Design an open architecture personnel management database solution system capable of servicing 175,000 employees (soldiers, sailors, airmen, policemen and civilians) of the Iraqi Ministry of Defense.  It must have the capability to expand in increments of 5,000 or 10,000 to a maximum of 300,000 personnel. It should be centrally managed with web based data input capability at lower levels.  The database must be able to track current recruits, retirees, and recently separated personnel.  

ii. The database management interface must be in the Arabic language and include:

1. Position Control – A position control module will be the foundation of the personnel database management system.  Positions will be budgeted for, approved and assigned to specific organizational units.  Vacant positions will be identified for recruitment.  Filled positions will be reported against and compared to budget.  Budget vs. Actuals may be reported at a summary level, organizational unit level or down to the position level. There needs to be “position flexibility” in the sense that there are times when units are temporarily overmanned for operational reasons or to cover programmed losses due to retirement/separation etc. 
2. Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSA’s) – A database of KSA’s will help integrate requirements across positions, potential recruits, employees, training, performance evaluation and succession planning.  A list of required KSA’s will be assigned to each position.  Potential recruits can be evaluated based on the KSA’s they possess as compared to the required KSA’s of the vacant position.  A database of KSA’s can be maintained for each employee allowing for quick answers to questions like, “Do we have any soldiers with telecommunication skills who are fluent in Kurdish in this set of battalions?”  Training courses can be categorized by relevant KSA’s and employees can be targeted for training based on gaps between KSA’s they possess vs. the KSA’s required of their current or anticipated future positions.  Similarly, KSA’s can form the basis for performance evaluations and succession planning.
3. Flexibility – The requirements of the personnel database management system will change, sometimes rapidly, as the Iraqi Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior evolve over the near and long terms.  
4. Audit Trails – The personnel database management system will have a built-in audit feature that can track which system user made what change at what time and indicate the old and new data values. 
5. Hierarchal Permission Structure to limit changes from lower levels in the organization.  For example, a battalion should only have access to view and make changes to personnel assigned to that specific battalion.  A brigade should only have access to every person assigned to that brigade etc.
 
iii. The proposed solution must provide for the following key areas associated with Personnel life cycle management.  
1. Force Management
a. Manpower Requirements Management
b. Recruiting
c. Accessions
d. Accountability
e. Casualty/Martyr/Survivor Benefits
f. Assignments
g. Promotions (promotion eligibility/indicator codes)
h. Leave
i. Performance Evaluation
j. Disciplinary Actions
k. Reenlistments
l. Testing
m. Pay
n. Combat Readiness
o. Records Management
p. Separations
q. Retirements
r. Duty Status (AWOL, Present for Duty, Leave etc)
s. Awards
t. Military Education/Civilian Education
u. Medical (date of last physical)
v. Physical Fitness 
w. Emergency Data (DD form 93)
x. Language/Specialty Identifier Codes
y.  Basic Active Service Date
z. Separation Date
aa. Separation Codes

2. Force Development
a. Vetting
b. Training
c. Senior Leader Development
d. Occupational Specialty Management
3. Budgeting
4. Long Range Personnel Planning
5. Demographic data – including age, tribe, religion (Muslim, Christian, etc.) and sect (Sunni, Shi’ite, Kurd etc.), ethnicity, marital status, education level, gender

iv. The proposed database solution should be windows and web based.  It should be able to operate on a networked desktop computer that meets these minimum requirements:  
1. Desktop specifications-- Pentium Processor 4 or AMD equivalent @ 2.0GHz/533MHz FSB, MS Windows 2000 SP4, 512MB DDR Memory, 40GB Hard Drive, 1.44MB Floppy Drive, DVD+CDR/W Drive, Software included: (MS Office 2000 Professional Edition, Antivirus, WinZip compatible compression/archive), ball/optical scroll mouse, keyboard, 10/100baseT compatible Ethernet network card, 220V compatible power supply, standard warranty.
