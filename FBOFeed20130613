<DESC>It is anticipated that this requirement will be solicited and awarded as a Labor-Hour type contract. The main objectives of the project are to create and implement a modern methodology to clean, evaluate, and migrate Packard Campus audio and video preservation, discovery, and authority metadata; to improve and maintain the functionality and integrity of multiple local metadata repositories (with the ultimate goal of eliminating separate metadata silos); to fully and clearly document data cleaning and migration processes and procedures; to provide automated data migration scripts or applications; and to provide user training to the PCAVC staff.
<p>At a minimum, the following activities are essential to the success of this project and should appear in the proposal with the accompanying description of proposed work and deliverables. Additional proposed deliverables, deemed necessary to fulfill the objectives of the project, are welcomed and encouraged.</p>
<p>&bull; Collaborate with PCAVC management and stakeholders to identify and document business processes and develop a semi-automated methodology for easy data cleanup and migration between the databases utilized within the Library - ILS, SONIC/STAR, and MAVIS. This methodology should apply to metadata stored in locally created and donor-contributed Access databases, Excel spreadsheets, MS Word and WordPerfect files.<br />&bull; The developed methodology should allow for minimal human interaction throughout the process and should allow for easy verification of the resulting data.<br />&bull; Propose, develop, and/or modify tools for implementing the proposed data cleanup and migration methodologies. The proposed tools may consist of COTS as well as proprietary or modified COTS. Open source tools are strongly preferred.<br />&bull; Create testing plan with concomitant test data and test scripts in order to ensure consistent performance of proposed solutions.<br />&bull; Create scripts or applications which allow PCAVC staff to use the aforementioned tools in an automated fashion.<br />&bull; Create scripts which will integrate with the Packard Campus Workflow Application for the automated creation of MAVIS records.<br />&bull; Perform "proof of concept" demonstrations using the proposed tools and methodologies. Evaluation criteria for the methodologies should include but are not limited to:<br />&#61692; Migration performance<br />&#61692; Data accuracy<br />&#61692; Data consistency <br />&#61692; Ease and flexibility of use<br />&#61692; End to end solution<br />&#61692; Speed and efficiency<br />&bull; Provide training and implementation support.<br />&bull; Collaborate with PCAVC management and stakeholders to identify and prioritize collections to be cleaned and/or migrated.<br />&bull; Create a schedule for data migrations and cleanup.<br />&bull; Perform data migration and data cleanup based on stakeholder priorities and approved schedule.<br />&bull; Create all appropriate project management and technical documentation, contractually required deliverables, and other documentation in support of all project tasks.<br />&bull; Provide quality control to the requirements gathering, design, implementation, integration, and testing processes throughout the entire lifecycle of the project.</p>
<p>All project deliverables consisting of text, spreadsheets, diagrams, and Gantt Charts should be provided in Microsoft Office 2003-compatible format. Scripts or application source code should be in Java, Groovy, or Python. All documents should be stored at all times in the LC/MBRS document repository and should comply with all Library standards. Any tools, code, scripts, or applications must be maintained within Library source control.</p>
<p>Success in these objectives will help the staff at PCAVC reach the strategic goal of the Library to efficiently provide audio and video discoverability, conservation, and preservation services to its clients.</p>

System must provide the following salient characteristics:
1. Triage Categories
a. Needs to be able to triage patients by a wall mountable Ticket Printer/Touchscreen machine.  The system will issue a number to the patient based on predetermined categories (Emergency Room, Patients with Appointments, Refill prescriptions, Etc.)  These categories must be editable. This system must also include wall mountable visual displays (Red LED Signs) that guide the patients to the correct window.
b. System will display (on each licensed PC) to staff the number of patients waiting in each category and for how long.
c. Pharmacy staff then can selectively call the patient to the window, based on the urgency, using the issued number.
2. Web Based Software ? each PC can access the program without it necessarily being installed on the PC.  Management will be able to direct the workflow, example:  If there is a high number patients in the waiting room, pharmacist can be quickly taken off other tasks, just for a few moments to process the patients.  And if there is a low volume patients waiting yet a high volume of prescriptions to verify and dispense workload can be directed there.  3. Reporting:  System need to have capability to generate a variety of reports to include statistical analysis such as-
a. Average Waiting Time ? b. % of Patients seen in less than XX time ? ideal to show leadership how long it takes to acknowledge a patient that is in the waiting room
c. Patients Per Day ? Pharmacy interacts with many patients in the booth for whom these are no prescriptions generated inside (questions, process for mail, etc).  This real workload that really is not measurable without a system like this.
4. Self-serve for patients:  wall mountable Ticket Printer/Touchscreen machine that patient can receive a number from a central point in the lobby.

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. Send protests (other than protests to the contracting officer) to: ? Address: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 ? Fax: (256) 450-8840 ?

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with OmicSoft Corporation, Morrisville, NC 275601, pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This procurement is for (1) each of the following: Maintenance Agreement Renewal for 1 year - OmicSoft Array Studio and Array Server Renewal. The Omicsoft software package is fully integrated into the NMC's work flow and it serves as the primary gene expression analysis and data repository system. Currently data from all NMC projects are processed through the analysis pipelines and the analysis results are included in the project reports NMC provide to its customers. Thus, it serves a critical role for NMC to achieve its mission of providing state of the art gene expression program to NIEHS scientific community. The complete Omicsoft software packages consist of two products: Array Studio and Array Server. Array Studio provides the analysis and visualization engine for analyzing gene expression data with an excellent array of analysis tools and capabilities. The framework for gene expression data analysis in Array studio is the comprehensive General Linear Model with ability to perform simple analysis (ANOVA, regression) and complicated analysis (mixed models, covariance analysis, nested factors). Array Server is fully integrated with Array Studio, and it provides an enterprise solution for management of the same data that can be analyzed by Array Studio. Storing data in a central location on the server provides NMC with the means to share data with NIEHS researchers. Moreover it also allows cross-platform or cross-project integration and comparison. Array Server provides a simple interface to do full text search on metadata or annotation and filter data by a variety of numeric metrics such as ratios, fold changes, intensity values. They also provide customizable pipeline processes that integrate with our in-house LIMS system MAPS. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability. Respond to this requirement by submitting written capabilities/specifications to the Purchasing Agent using the provided email address. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 5 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of the Cooperative Research Program of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for Charter Vessel Partner Support to participate in a priority research project relative to Northeast fisheries.<br />The vessel shall be involved in conducting a catchability study and biological sampling of flatfish populations on Georges Bank. The purpose of the sampling will be (1) to develop comparative estimates of flatfish abundance in a relatively small and productive flatfish area using different vessels and gear; (2) to better understand the relative catchability of the surveying system on the NEFSC R/V Henry Bigelow; and (3) to provide biological sampling of flatfish populations in this area. The project will evaluate differences in catchability and flatfish abundance estimates of a 4-seam net with a cookie sweep fished on the commercial vessel selected for this work with the same 4-seam net with a rockhopper sweep fished aboard the R/V Bigelow simultaneously on Georges Bank. The study will focus on yellowtail flounder and winter flounder, but the project will broadly address flatfish catchability. Results will be used to calibrate a possible future flatfish pilot survey designed to improve sampling density and precision of flatfish biomass estimates on Georges Bank. The selected vessel will be tasked with sampling between 50 and 60 bottom trawl stations on Georges Bank during a 6 day trip. The sampling must occur concurrently with sampling aboard the R/V Bigelow in the same area to ensure maximum comparative power.<br />This is a 100% Total Small Business Set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 541712 Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences. The small business size standard is 500 employees. The solicitation and proposed fixed-price contract will be issued utilizing FAR Part 12 and FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items and will be evaluated on a best value basis wherein the following factors 1 - 5, listed in descending order of importance, when combined, are significantly more important than price: (1) Description of vessel characteristics and configuration, particulars and general arrangement (preferably with photos of deck configuration, berthing arrangement and wheelhouse electronics); (2) Description of each vessel commercial fishing history and any other information important in evaluating the vessel's fishing capability; (3) Description of the Master's and crew's work experience qualifications including copies of licenses held and emergency medical qualifications and descriptions of research qualifications and past research performed; (4) past performance and (5) price.

This modification is for the production of the Navys entire requirements for CPS units, Advanced COTS Enclosures (ACE), and technical support services for development and integration necessitated by obsolescence or other configuration changes.  Award is planned for the 2nd quarter FY14. This sole source modification does not impact the CPS TI-12 Build to Print Competition planned for release in 3rd quarter FY 2013.

This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at "https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps" or by calling the NAVSUP WSS PCO. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.

<DESC>The NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support is modifying the 5-year Northrop Grumman Basic Ordering Agreement N00383-10-G-026G to add repair of the following components supporting the AH-1Z and UH-1Y Aircraft: The following items are the top three high dollar value items for repair: Mission Computer, NSN 7RH 1680 015651991, est. 25 each; Mission Computer, NSN 7RH 1680 015651994, est. 18 each; Computer,Aircraft NSN 7RH 1680 015449009, est. 6 each. 
The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items has been solicited.
  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the "http://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" U.S. Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP Weapons Systems Support at (215) 697-4243.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<RESPDATE>062813

<CONTACT>Anna Ricci C. Cayanan, 916-557-5231

<a href="mailto:anna.r.cayanan@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Sacramento</a>
<DESC>The Sacramento District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has an upcoming acquisition to establish contracts to retrofit the tainter gates at New Hogan Dam in Valley Springs, California.   <br> 	The New Hogan Project is located approximately 60 miles southeast of Sacramento, California and is operated and maintained by the Corps of Engineers, Sacramento district.  The project includes a lake, dam and a spillway with three tainter gates.  The New Hogan Project was constructed in the early 1960's.   <br> The New Hogan Dam Tainter Gate Retrofit, as originally constructed in 1963, is part of the New Hogan Dam which is rock filled structure with a separate concrete spillway structure.  This dam is used for both flood control and water conservation.  The crest length of the main dam is 1,935 feet at elevation 725.0 mean sea level (msl).  The length of the concrete spillway structure is 142 feet with the top of the tainter gate at elevation 722.97 msl.    <br> The spillway is located approximately 600 feet south of the left abutment of the main dam and consists of a concrete structure with three 38 foot by 37 foot tainter gates.  The spillway structure is approximately 142 feet long. The effective crest length is 114 feet with a crest elevation of 679.5 feet. <br> Each of the three tainter gates at the spillway crest is 38 feet wide and 37 feet high.   Embedded in concrete piers, a post-stressed anchorage system secures the trunnion 14' 6 quote mark  above the bottom of the gate.  The trunnion is above the theoretical flow line for a spillway flood discharge of 117,400 cfs.  If this flow line is exceeded, the bottom of the gate and the trunnions will be inundated.  All of these parts however, were designed to withstand this remote possibility. <br> Twenty vertical ribs, spaced 2 feet apart, reinforce the steel face plate.  Three girders support the ribs and connect through the struts to the end frames.  Forces transfer through the end frames and directly to the welded steel trunnion.  The bolts connecting the end frames and trunnion only maintain alignment between the two members.  The bracing of the 3 girders was designed to support one half the weight of the gate, assuming one side remains supported.  If one of the two lifting cables should break, the gate will twist until it jams between the piers.  Bracing prevents buckling of the girders by reducing the distance between support points. <br> The trunnion bears on a bronze bushing encased in a steel shell.  The shell is fastened to the anchor member and reinforced by a heavy steel strap.  End clearance between the bearing and the trunnion allows for lateral displacement of the trunnion.  End clearance permits elongation due to loads and expansion from the temperature difference between the gate and concrete spillway.  A post tensioned anchorage fastens each of the trunnions to the piers.  It efficiently distributes forces from the tainter gate to the piers.  The anchorage is comprised of 15 high strength alloy steel rods 1   quote mark  in diameter.  The rods are embedded into the pier 35 feet.  These rods hold a short welded box trunnion girder against the pier.  The trunnion assemblies are bolted to the cantilevered ends of the trunnion girders. <br> The concrete lined chute directs spillway flows from the ogee section to the flip bucket about 214 feet downstream.  There is a three span composite concrete deck and steel girder spillway bridge which was designed to carry a crane with load totaling 58 tons.  The three simple spans are two at 43' 8.5 quote mark  and one at 46'. <br> The Contractor shall have experience in fabrication or repair of large Hydraulic Steel Structures such as a Tainter gate, Miter gate, or bulkhead gate and electrical and mechanical procurement and installation.   The contractor shall have completed three similar projects, two of which were tainter gates, in the last seven years.   <br> The Contractor shall demonstrate experience in the following areas: <br> Welding and QC: heavy construction field welding and qualifications of off-site fabrication / shop welding services, as well as quality control, including control of material quality, material testing procedures, and field welding techniques.  The fabricating plant and fabricator performing this work shall be certified under the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) Quality Certification Program, Category III, Major Steel Bridges (CBR) category with Fracture Critical endorsement (F) and shall possess five (5) years documented experience on projects of similar scope.  Similar scope for shop fabrication means projects of similar size and similar amounts of welding and detail types.   <br> Mechanical:  installing mechanical equipment including motors, speed reducers, shafting, couplings, open gearing, bearings, and large bushings in precise alignment.  The offerer shall have a minimum of five (5) years of documented experience on projects installing mechanical equipment including motors, speed reducers, shafting, couplings, open gearing, bearings, and large bushings in precise alignment.  The offerer shall also have completed at least one project of similar scope or replacement of hoist machinery for a large structure.   <br> Electrical: dealing with motors, panelboards, limit switches and misc other equipment and accessories. Contractor shall be familiar with applicable provisions of NFPA 70 (NEC).

The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package. Interested contractors shall review, fill-in and return the attached Capabilities Matrix and may also submit a 4-8 page capabilities document. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements. Your statement of capabilities should include the following: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Small business size certification if applicable. Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to Gregory.Allen.22@us.af.mil. Statements should be submitted no later than 24 JUN 2013 1:00 PM E.T. The Government will endeavor to answer any questions interested parties may have. All questions must be submitted in writing to Gregory.Allen.22@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) intends to negotiate with only one source, Gibson-Barnes, 1900 Weld Blvd., #140, El Cajon, CA 92020, for Gentex SPH5C Helmets, to be used in wild land fire operations. This action is authorized by and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency's requirement is Gibson-Barnes. The Gentex SPH5C Helmet is the helmet used by various federal programs.  These helmets are a health and safety product used to insure the safe transport of all persons being transported in federal or contract aircraft. Policy concerning these helmets is established by OAS and USFS. A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $300,000.00.  No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation.  This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  The requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 339113 applies.  Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item L13PS00578.  However, they must provide convincing evidence that they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost.  All responses will be fully considered.  If no affirmative responses are received by June 17, 2013, to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with Gibson-Barnes for the requirement stated here.  Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Pat Phelps at 208-387-5717 or faxed to 208-387-5574.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY <br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is conducting market research to support the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Laboratory of DNA Viruses requirement for one (1) high performance, high capacity refrigerated floor model centrifuge to include inside delivery, installation, set-up, and post-warranty maintenance for up to 4 option years.</p>
<p>This is a sources sought to determine the availability and capability of small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is&#8208; 334516 &#8208; Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Laboratory of DNA Viruses requires one (1) high performance, high capacity refrigerated floor model centrifuge to include inside delivery, installation, set-up, and post-warranty maintenance for up to 4 option years. This instrument is necessary for studying the oncogenicity of DNA and the tumorigenicity of cell substrates used for vaccines. As part of the studies on vaccine safety, the FDA is developing in vivo assays to detect oncogenic activity of DNA. The centrifuge will be used at several stages of these experiments. In the case of mammalian cell cultures, protein and DNA are prepared from cell lines established from tumors. To prepare plasmid DNA, bacterial cells are harvested by centrifugation, and DNA plasmids are prepared and purified for inoculation into animals.</p>
<p>Scope:<br /><br />In the research, rodents are used to study the possible induction of tumors that result from their subcutaneous exposure to various cell substrates and oncogenic DNA. Tumor formation can take up to six months, and in some cases, no tumors are observed.</p>
<p>When preparing the DNA for inoculation, the DNA goes through an extensive purification process. First, large scale bacterial cultures are spun down in 500 mL bottles to isolate the bacterial cells carrying the desired DNA plasmid. Next, the cells are transferred to 40 mL round bottom tubes and are lysed to allow for separation of the plasmid. During this step, the tubes are spun at 18,000 rpm. From this stage, the plasmids are transferred to 50 mL conical tubes and are then spun at lower speeds. Once the DNA is purified it is used, as mentioned above, in rodent models to study tumor formation.</p>
<p>When a tumor is induced, it is excised from the animal and a cell line is created. The cell lines are then carried in cell culture. This centrifuge will be used to spin down uninfected cells and viral-infected cells from these cultures. It will also be used for the clarification of virus supernatants to prepare viral stocks for frozen storage. These cells must be spun down at low speed in a refrigerated centrifuge to maintain viability.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements:</p>

<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] under the <strong>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except biotechnology).</strong></p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide goods and services as stated below.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide: (1) web service API returning genes and models based on phenotype similarity, (2) a phenotypic similarity approach with PPI, co-expression, etc. to cover cases where an animal model does not yet exist but pheno-copying pathway partners do, (3) an improved of HPO request pipeline, (4) improvements of tools for curating UDP patient phenotypes, and (5) an integration of these tools with the UDP-LIMS.</p>
<p><strong>Integration to UDP Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS 24/7) is essential and key. The phenotyping tool within LIMS 24/7, was tailored specifically for UDP by the manufacturer RuRo Inc. Therefore, the Contractor must be familiar and have the ability to integrate with this system</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md. It was organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and the NIH Clinical Center. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program.</p>
<p>The Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) offers patients the hope of a diagnosis and the possibility of therapeutic strategies. In return, patients provide UDP researchers the opportunity to gain new insights about genetic and biochemical mechanisms of disease and insights into normal cell biology, biochemistry and physiology. So far, UDP researchers have encountered patients with uncommon presentations of known disorders, multi-systemic complex disorders and new disorders that have never been diagnosed. UDP clinical researchers are using advances in DNA sequencing to detect defects in genes that point to known disorders. These tools offer the potential for discoveries about the role of molecular and biochemical events that can cause disease and, eventually, the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for rare and common diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>:</p>
<p>Provide a robust methodology for recording patient phenotypes in the standardized and robust human phenotype ontology nomenclature, provide a real time mapping of those terms to known human diseases and model organisms (fly, mouse, zebrafish, and worm), and provide a tool for prioritizing exome and genome sequence variants according to phenotype.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS</span></strong>:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A. Specific Tasks</strong>:</span></p>
<p>1. Similarity algorithm will use human, fly, mouse, zebrafish, and worm phenotypes. The service will be based on OWLSim (http://owlsim.org). The Government will provide a web service layer that will be deployable using any standard servlet container (TomCat, Jetty).<br />2. Widget-style development suitable for integration into Phenotips (dependent on Phenotips to call the API)<br />3. Visualization and evidence for the matches <br />4. Identify researchers with expertise in assaying phenotypes related to models of interest<br />5. Provide API hooks to use similarity algorithm to enhance Phenotips explanations of "you may wish to co-annotate this", based on both phenotypic profiles using HPO annotations and model systems phenotypic profiles. This is an indication of what differentiating phenotypes might be most important to record.<br />6. Make additional phenotype data and improved algorithm available via OWLSim<br />7. Integration of phenotypic similarity approach with PPI, co-expression, etc. to cover cases where an animal model does not yet exist but pheno-copying pathway partners do.<br />8. Improvement of HPO request pipeline. The Government will create a request service that would allow users to submit requested terms along with supporting material, including parentage, database cross-references, and PubMed IDs. The service will be based on software developed at LBL (termgenie.org) for use in the Gene Ontology and will be adapted for use with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We will refactor the HPO using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) in order to support this functionality.<br />9. Develop semantic models of temporal and severity characteristics to support Phenotips data entry.<br />10. Improved logical definitions for maximal interoperability with other organisms and data types. This could include improved annotations and terms for diseases of interest at UDP, coordination with mammalian phenotype ontology as needed.<br />11. The Contractor shall work with Ruro Inc. to test UDP-LIMs for data consistency and export: <br />a. Data consistency risks<br />b. Ontology integration<br />c. Phenotype-genotype export functionality <br />d. Data and software version control<br />e. Phenotips integration<br />f. Opportunities for enhancements surrounding workflow provenance and visualization<br />g. Curation guidance<br />12. Usability evaluation through static usability inspections, including heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthrough, to identify possible usability concerns and to suggest appropriate interface revisions.<br />13. Analyze Phenotips entry with respect to HPO to identify HPO/other ontology needs/opportunities.<br />14. Work with UDP-LIMS to define general curation guidelines that can be leveraged in UDP-LIMS, Phenotips, and by UDP extramural sites for consistent and quality genotype-phenotype data export (no PII).<br />15. Aid Phenotips in implementing logical rules (e.g. things like checking for gender-specific phenotypes), and tooltips for the rest of the guidelines<br />16. Determine QA measures and consider mechanisms to measure inter and intra-annotator consistency given the few clinical annotators and disparate records<br />17. Create preliminary data exchange format standard for UDP genotype-phenotype data.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. Desired Results/Functions/End Items</span></strong>:<br /><br />1. A web service API returning genes and models based on phenotype similarity, improved tools for HPO phenotyping, and full integration of tools into the UDP work flow (LIMS). <br />2. Research collaborations will be conducted via Videoconferences, email communications, shared professional presentations, posters and publications. Grand Round presentations at the Contractor's location and the NIH Clinical Center may also occur.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C. Technical Specifications/Standards/Methods</span></strong>:<br /><br />1. The Contractor shall develop and supply required algorithms, software tools to accomplish the above as well as assist in the implementation of these tools in the UDP work flow (LIMS).<br />2. The Contractor shall supply results with qualified interpretations in formats appropriate to the process management systems and for facilitation of other collaborations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">D. Special Handling or Handling Requirements:<br /><br /></span></strong>1. The Contractor shall provide result reports and record methods and materials as appropriate to the highest scientific standards. These materials, methods and results will be shared will agreed upon UDP collaborators.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">E. The Government will provide to the Contractor:<br /><br /></span></strong>1. The Government will not furnish any government property to the vendor<br />2. The Government will provide the data for analysis of the effectiveness of the tools being developed; this include phenotypes and exome data.<br />3. The Government will not furnish any facilities to be used by the vendor.</p>
<p><strong>The Government will be responsible for reviewing and approving reports and similar matters generated:</strong></p>
<p>1. Results will be provided electronically to the UDP via secure email, the UDP ftp site or direct deposition into the UDP process management system.<br />2. Results will also be shared with UDP collaborators as defined mutually.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">F. Reporting Requirements and Deliverables</span></strong>:</p>
<p>1. The Government will receive all electronic results, software and tools within 52 weeks of initiation of the contract, and the contractor will assist the UDP with integration of these into the UDP workflow (LIMS) within that timeframe.</p>
<p>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and in the draft SOW.

There is a need for internationally comparable datasets to permit investigation of the compression of morbidity in aging populations; provide new information on the differential changes of mortality in countries with different health care delivery systems, and allow detailed analysis of changes in health, socio-economic status and economic behavior as populations' age. The NIA's Strategic Plan outlines the importance of studies on healthy aging, well-being and longevity, and places an emphasis on understanding how population aging and changes in social, economic, and demographic characteristics of cohorts reaching old age affect health and well-being in the United States and other countries. These activities will be advanced though alignment of instruments for data collection, uniformity in interviewing protocols, development of validation tools, and increasing the availability of datasets cross-nationally comparable to the NIA supported US Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of older Americans 50 and older with a comprehensive collection of data covering several domains to support interdisciplinary research. The Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe Study (SHARE) is designed after the HRS and the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), and this support is intended to enhance harmonization within these datasets.</p>
<p>The SHARE study first conducted interviews in 2004/5 (Wave 1) of about 27,000 individuals in 11 countries. The first follow-up (Wave 2) was in 2006/07 and added Ireland, Israel, the Czech Republic and Poland. In 2008/09, SHARE collected life histories for all individuals interviewed in wave 1 or 2. In 2010/11 (Wave 4) SHARE added large refresher samples in the 15 countries surveyed in Waves 1-3 and added four more countries: Estonia, Hungary, Portugal and Slovenia. Though processing for Wave 4 is not yet complete, the final sample is expected to contain about 65,000 individuals. Thanks to support from NIA, SHARE has adopted interviewer training, retention strategies, and survey design to increase the comparability of SHARE to HRS and ELSA to support the cross-national research objectives of NIA. The European Commission and the German government have secured funding for coordination and questionnaire development for waves 5 and 6 under the conditions that more European countries are included and the member countries finance data collection in their countries. While including new countries will undoubtedly increase the power of SHARE as a cross-national laboratory, lower funding levels per country are likely to endanger the quality and the breadth of the data for scientific purposes, and reduce its comparability with HRS and ELSA. Central funding sources are thus crucial, especially to maintain comparability with HRS and ELSA. To this end, NIA wishes to contract with the Munich Center for the Economics of Aging at the Max Planck Institute for Social Law and Social Policy to continue supporting harmonization activities being undertaken by the SHARE. <br />Capability Statement</p>

<p>Background Information:<br />Schizophrenia is a complex genetic disorder which likely involves many genes each producing a slight increase in risk. Finding week acting genes in complex genetic disorders has been challenging and requires a number of approaches and large clinical samples. Several strategies have emerged recently that appear to markedly improve the power of genetic studies for detecting such genes. These include using "association" (rather that linkage) and using intermediate phenotypes in addition to DMS-IV diagnosis. NIMH proposes to take advantage of these techniques by studying quantitative traits related to schizophrenia in patients, siblings, and controls. NIMH employs an association design, rather than linkage. Traits will include quantifiable neurobiological variables that have been implicated previously as possible phenotypes related to schizophrenia. These include tests of attention, and cognition, eye tracking, evoked potentials, and a variety of parameters using brain imaging. NIMH uses several statistical methods to show that specific genetic polymorphisms affect these phenotypes, including case control and family based association studies.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement:<br />The Clinical Brain Disorders Branch (CBDB)/Genes, Cognition and Psychosis Program (GCAP) requests the hire of a Clinical Psychologist to be directly involved in a project that aims to screen potential CBDB Sibling Study participants; perform SCID evaluations for mental health diagnoses on probands and healthy controls; modifies and tailors the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders to be better reflect that needs of the research; develop an interview process to give the severely mental ill subjects the ability to answer deep probing questions; and establish and monitor inter-rater reliability among those performing various diagnostic assessments.</p>

<DESC>Responses are due no later than 2:00 p.m. eastern standard time June24, 2013.  This is a Sources Sought Notice and is for informational/ market research purposes only.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS, OR BIDS.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, requests capability statements from qualified Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned SB (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Historically or Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones), small businesses concerning the potential project described below.  Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.  <br>  <br> Responses are to be sent via email to Stephen.A.Stolte@usace.army.mil no later than 2:00 p.m. eastern standard time June 24, 2013.  <br>     <br> Project Description:  Dalecarlia Pumping Station Building Renovations, Washington Aqueduct Division, Washington, DC.  This project will be Design-Bid-Build using NAICS Code: 236220 - Commercial and Institutional Building Construction <br>  <br> The solicitation will be for a construction contract and it will be advertized as an invitation for bid (IFB) in the $1M - $5M range. The work includes architectural and structural improvements to the Dalecarlia Pumping Station Building to repair failing building components and to improve functionality.  Specific work items include replacing deteriorated cast stone coping and ballasted EPDM roof membranes; repairing a large sliding door and interior glazed tile and masonry wall cracks throughout the building; repaint interior spaces; replace the sewer ejector system; lighting and other miscellaneous improvements and repairs to interior spaces. The project also involves an optional item to replace the ballasted EPDM roof membrane of the adjacent Chemical Building. <br>  <br> The Washington Aqueduct provides portable water to approximately one million people in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia. The Dalecarlia Pumping Station pumps water to four service areas, namely; Low Service, First High, Second High and Third High. The building has a control room, which includes a SCADA system that controls all major pumping units. This building is also the electrical distribution point for the entire Dalecarlia WTP. Major modification work needs to be performed while the pumping station remains fully operational. This is needed to ensure reliable operation and guarantee uninterrupted water supply to our customers. Therefore, an experienced contractor with resources and expertise to handle the following project constraints is needed: <br>  <br> i.	Working at an industrial facility around a portable water supply system. <br> ii.	Staging in areas with limited weight restrictions when replacing large cast stones.  <br> iii.	Maintaining functional operation of a sewer ejector system during replacement. <br> iv.	Performing construction activities in a fully operational building while maintaining utilities and access to non construction employees. <br> v.	Roof replacement where there is limited access the roof structure. <br>  <br> Interested qualified Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned SB (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones), or Qualified Section 8(a) certified firms should submit a concise narrative and specific project examples of similar size and scope that demonstrate their experience in:  <br> 1.	The successful rigging, staging and replacement of large cast stone copings from areas with restricted weight limits. <br> 2.	The replacement of ballasted EPDM roof membranes. <br> 3.	The successful and seamless repair of failing brick walls and other structural repairs involving walls, concrete pedestals, glazed tiles and masonry walls. <br> 4.	The replacement of the building sewer ejector system. <br> 5.	The replacement and upgrade of existing light fixtures to include energy efficient lighting fixtures with motion sensors. <br>  <br> Capability statements should include information and details of similar projects, to include demonstrated specialized experience and technical competence in: <br> (a)	Performing large cast coping stone replacement. The new coping stones must match the existing in color and texture. The contractor will be required to procure and install large sections of heavy cast stone coping for the different cross sections. <br> (b)	Seamless replacement of interior glazed tile. The interior walls of the pumping station consist of a 4 quote mark  thick glazed tile veneer which has buckled and failed in some areas. The project requires matching glazed tile and mortar to be procured and installed at height. The resulting glaze tile replacement of these high profile areas must be indistinguishable from the existing areas. <br> (c)	Repair of failed exterior masonry brick walls areas that are failing. The project requires the contractor to procure matching brick and mortar and make repairs. The resulting repairs of these high profile exterior wall areas must be indistinguishable from the existing areas. <br> (d)	Phased replacement and conversion of the building sewer ejector system from pneumatic to electric operation. The building has to remain operational for employee use throughout the project. Therefore, one of the sewage ejector units need to remain operational at all times. <br> (e)	Rigging and scaffolding while maintaining access into the pumping station. Scaffolding will need to be erected in a way that ensures that the 14' x 18' south door opening remains accessible at all times. This opening is used to transport the large pumps or motors in and out of the building for maintenance and repairs. <br>  <br> In addition please provide a letter from the surety regarding the potential Small Business General Contractor's maximum bonding capability for a single contract action between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00, and total aggregate bonding capacity. <br>  <br> Narratives shall be no longer than ten pages.  Email responses are required.   <br>  <br> Comments will be shared with the Government and the project design team, but otherwise will be held in strict confidence. <br>  <br> Responses must include the offerors' name, POC phone number, SAM information and email address. <br>  <br>

This is the follow-on acquisition for the contract known as Space and Missile Defense Initiatives Support III (SMDIS III), Contract Numbers W91260-09-D-0003, W91260-09-D-0004, W91260-09-D-0005, and W91260-09-D-0006.  Responses to this announcement will be used to identify interested qualified sources available in the marketplace.   <br>  <br> The contractor shall be required to provide non-personal advisory and assistance (A&AS) services for U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) / Army Forces Strategic Command (ARSTRAT) and agencies which collaborate with them on definition, planning, development, and execution of Space, Missile Defense, Global Strike, Information Operations (IO), Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA) missions, and related missions. <br>  <br> The resultant A&AS contract(s) shall support all functional areas of the contract Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The primary areas are anticipated to include: <br>  <br> (1)  Infrastructure, Organizational Analysis, and Evaluations <br> (2)  Intelligence Requirements <br> (3)  System Engineering and Systems Integration Analysis <br> (4)  Software, Network Development, and Information System Support <br> (5)  Integrated Logistic Support <br> (6)  Emerging Technologies Analysis <br> (7)  Meetings & Conference Organization Support <br> (8)  Staff Support <br> (9)  Operations Support <br> (10) Organizational Analysis <br> (11) SATCOM and Communications System Planning and Support <br>  <br> Other areas that are anticipated in a limited capacity include: <br>  <br> (1)  Simulation and Modeling Development <br> (2)  Rapid Prototyping, Limited Procurement, & Fielding <br>  <br> The resultant contract(s) shall provide A&AS services to include, but not limited to: vision statements and doctrine; development of  architectures; program support e.g., planning, development, fielding documentation, modeling and simulation, system analysis and integration, integrated logistics support, development of strategy, support to the warfighter, contingency and mission support, program oversight, independent verification validation and test evaluation, prototype development, sustainment and operation, training, and analysis of emerging technologies. Other areas for support include C4ISR; Space; Missile Defense; IO; Global Strike; Infrastructure, Organization Analysis, and Evaluations; Intelligence Requirements; Systems Engineering and Systems Integration Analysis; Simulation and Modeling Development; Rapid Prototyping and Limited Development; Software Development, Network Development, and Information Systems Support; Integrated Logistics Support; Emerging Technologies Analysis; Meetings and Conference Organization Support; Staff Support; Space Operations Support, and Homeland Security. The effort detailed herein will evolve over the course of the contract. New technologies, capabilities and initiatives will be supported. As such, the contractor shall be responsive to new and revised efforts.  However, it shall be clear that any effort that involves Space, Missile Defense, Global Strike, IO, C4ISR, TCA, and related missions for supported organizations are included in the scope of this effort.   <br>  <br> To assist interested parties in understanding the requirement, the PWS for the current SMDIS III contract is provided at the following website(s):  (Note:  The PWS for the new acquisition will be similar to the current PWS but will incorporate some changes.) <br>  <br> Army Single Face to Industry (AFSI) Acquisition Business Website <br> https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ <br>  quote mark Contracting Opportunities Search quote mark  <br>  <br> Federal Business Opportunities <br> https://www.fbo.gov <br>  <br> This is only a RFI/Sources Sought synopsis.  A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.   <br>  <br> This RFI has two purposes:  (1) to obtain expressions of interest from industry in support of the USASMDC/ARSTRAT and associated agencies requirement; and (2) to roughly gauge the capability of those interested small business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level.  Information will be utilized to make the final decision concerning the number of awards and type(s) of set-asides, if any.  The responses to this notice are for Government planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a definitive intent to proceed with this acquisition. <br>   <br> For the purposes of market research, the Government is seeking to understand the capability and capacity of interested businesses, but especially small business firms.  If you are a small business, and if the Government were to set this acquisition aside for small business, you would be required to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting and 13 CFR 125.6 (known as the 50% rule).  Rules on affiliation and joint ventures are at FAR 19.101, 13 CFR 121.103, 13 CFR 124.513, and 13 CFR 125.6.  Under the 50% rule where the preponderance of support is for services, at least 50% of the cost of the contractor performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business prime. The small business prime contractor must meet this requirement (1) individually, or (2) together with other small business members of a formal of a formal joint venture, or (3) together with a small number of small business subcontractors forming an informal joint venture, in which those subcontractors meet the definition of ostensible subcontractor as set forth in 13 CFR 121.103 (h)(4).  Team members in such formal and informal joint ventures are exempt from affiliation rules under the conditions set forth in 13 CFR 121.103 (h)(3).  There is no limit to the number of other team subcontractors or size status of subcontractors.  The contemplated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services with a small business size standard of $14M.   <br>  <br> The Government anticipates awarding multiple Cost-Plus Fixed-Fee Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity contracts to satisfy this requirement.  It is anticipated the maximum ceiling amount will not exceed $496 million, with an expected minimum order amount of $100,000.00.  Further, we are exploring the potential to maximize set-aside opportunities for the SMDA2S acquisition.  As the Government is unsure of the extent of anticipated small and small-disadvantaged business participation, it is undecided as to the specific number and/or set-aside awards to target during the development of its acquisition strategy.  Small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award of a set-aside contract, PROVIDING THAT EACH TEAM MEMBER MEETS THE NAICS CODE SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD.  However, cross teaming will not be allowed. <br>  <br> Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from industry responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. <br>  <br> The resultant contract may contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause.  To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Government's interest, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contractor's actual SMDA2S performance. <br>  <br> Statement of Capability <br>  <br> Interested parties are requested to submit a statement of capability. The statement should include: <br>  <br> a. 	Vendor Information: <br> Name <br> Address <br> Point of Contact (POC), Phone Number, E-mail Address <br> CAGE Code <br> Brief Introduction of Company <br>  <br> b.  Past work performed that is related to this requirement as stated in the Description and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers.  Along with a description of relevant contracts experience, identify if the company performed as a prime or subcontractor and include the contract number, magnitude (amount), place of performance, date(s) of performance, and points of contact for each experience provided (name of point of contact, address, email, and telephone number).  If the contract was a set-aside, and your company was the prime, identify whether the 50% requirement was met. <br>  <br> c.  A brief description of the company's business size, business status (i.e., large/small business, disadvantaged, HUBzone, women-owned), anticipated teaming arrangements and their business size.   <br>  <br> d.  If teaming arrangements are anticipated, identify the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by teaming partners.  Demonstrate how the small business firm or small business team will perform at least 50% of the cost incurred for personnel.   <br>  <br> e.  A brief description of (1) the breadth and depth of technical and management expertise to successfully execute PWS requirements, (2) the capability to quickly ramp up qualified and trained personnel at the onset of the task order, (3) the capability to administer and manage an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, task order contract, and (4) capability to perform realistic cost and schedule projections for complex technical efforts.   <br>  <br> f.  A brief description of your company's property management system.   <br>  <br> g.  Indicate whether you currently have an established purchasing system and an adequate cost accounting system. <br>  <br> h.  Specific functional areas/tasks identified in the Description above your company, anticipated subcontractors, or anticipated teaming partners have NOT performed.   <br>  <br> i. Complete and return attached questionnaire (Attachment 1).  <br>         <br> Again, any information submitted by the respondents to this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will use this information in determining its small business set-aside decision.  The company's standard format is acceptable; however, the limit for all responses is not to exceed twenty (20) single-sided, 12 font size, 8   x 11-inch pages.  The statement of capability shall be UNCLASSIFIED.   <br>  <br> Submission Requirement <br>  <br> Only electronic responses shall be accepted.  Responses, including the questionnaire, shall be received no later than 1:00 P.M. (1300 hrs) local Colorado time, Monday, 24 June 2013.  <br>  <br> Points of Contact (please include all three POC's on the submission):  <br>  <br> Leslie A.

All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004 Alternate A, System for Award Management (SAM), is required.

In order to be considered for award, offerors must possess a TOP SECRET facility security clearance at the prime contractor level.   <br>  <br> Capability Briefings <br>  <br> The Government, if deemed beneficial, may choose to hold limited capability briefings to better understand small business potential to perform the requirement.  Dates TBD. <br>

General Requirements:  Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, materials, supplies and equipment necessary to collect, remove, and dispose of the VA's solid waste at the VA Black Hills Health Care System, Hot Springs, SD 57747, and Fort Meade, SD 57741, resulting from the day to day operation, except for the Resident Quarters located on facility grounds. Solid waste may also include used mattresses, broken furniture, used carpeting, bundled cardboard, construction rubble, etc. Solid waste will not include any items considered hazardous waste, medical waste, or any other waste defined by EPA as being not general solid waste. 
Contractor Compliance:  Contractor shall assume full responsibility for compliance with all current Federal, State, City, and County laws, VHA M-1 Part VII Chapter 14 dated 9/19/94, rules and regulations governing the collection, removal, and disposal of solid waste. Contractor will be responsible for providing copies of all necessary permits/documents. Contractor will dispose of any solid waste collected from the VA in such a manner as not to cause conditions detrimental to public health or to constitute a public nuisance. Contractor will assume full responsibility for clean up in the event any solid waste from the VA is released into the environment accidentally or otherwise, on or off VA property as a result of the Contractor's actions. 
Schedule Work:  Contractor shall provide a schedule of service agreeable by both the Contractor and VA. This schedule will be determined by the size and types of collection containers Contractor intends to provide. Other consideration must be given to the types of containers that food waste will be collected in. Contractor will provide this service on regular business days, Monday thru Friday, between the hours of 7:30 am until 4:30 pm. In the event a scheduled pick-up falls on a holiday the pick-up will take place no later than the next business day. 
Unscheduled Work:  From time to time there may be special needs that require immediate attention, such as, a collection container needs repaired, collection container is overfilled, collection container was missed on a regularly scheduled pick-up, etc. When this occurs the Contractor will respond within twenty-four hours to resolve the issue, even if that falls on a weekend or holiday, unless otherwise agreed upon by the VA. In the event inclement weather causes a delay in service the Contractor will provide service immediately upon road conditions improving.
Availability of Utilities:  The VA shall furnish at no expense to the Contractor, electricity at existing outlets for Contractor's use in performing this contract. Should the Contractor propose a plan that is beneficial to the VA in which additional electrical outlets would be required, the VA may consider installing them at the VA's expense.
Vehicles:  The Contractor shall use vehicles specifically designed for waste collection that have watertight bodies and do not permit loss of waste. Open box trucks, with canvas covers, shall not be permitted with the sole exception of specially requested roll off containers. Collection vehicles shall be maintained in good repair, operate safely, be relatively clean, and not be considered unsightly. Vehicles considered not to meet the prior minimum standards will not be permitted to collect waste on VA property until corrected. The Contractor shall have sufficient vehicles for backup of regularly assigned vehicles to insure completion of contract requirements in the event of breakdowns or other unforeseen problems. 
Containers:  Contractor shall provide easy loadable, leak proof industrial heavy duty type solid waste containers that have working lids/covers. Any containers that are mounted on wheels will have a mechanism that will lock the wheels for safety. Containers will be maintained in good operating condition, cleaned regularly, and will not be unsightly. No containers or lids will be rusty, bent, or damaged in any other way. Any containers identified by the VA to not meet the aforementioned defects will be replaced or repaired within seven (7) calendar days unless otherwise agreed upon by the VA. All containers should be of sufficient size to hold a minimum of three to four days of solid waste. Contractor shall provide a minimum of three compactor containers that meet all industry standard safety guidelines to protect the operators for accidental injury or death. Compactor containers will be operational year round regardless of weather and temperatures.
Collection Areas:  Contractor shall provide sufficient containers so that VA staff will have reasonable access from all buildings, i.e., Hospital, Domiciliary, Boiler Plants, Fire Stations, Building and Grounds, Facilities Management, etc. Contractor will insure that the area immediately surrounding any waste container is clean. Any large solid waste that will not fit into a waste container will also be removed at the Contractor's earliest convenience; however, at no time will this exceed more than seven (7) days.

Since World War II, the US has invested a considerable amount in RADAR systems, timely dissemination and data storage infrastructure. Digital communication systems (<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">nontraditional</em> RADAR systems) companies have spent considerable amount of dollars for stationary and mobile communication systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is well known that detection of ionized gases and plasma plumes via RADAR systems is possible. The unknown is how long can we detect and track the original plasma as it wanes and becomes harder and harder to distinguish from naturally occurring atmospheric ionized gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">2.1<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The primary purpose of this RFI is to explore RADAR and its value to the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) mission in a two-fold way. The technical focus is to correlate plasma phenomenology and electrical Radio Frequency properties to investigate the associated principles and establish facts. The focus is to identify and understand which traditional and nontraditional RADAR mission systems can be leveraged. The RFI will provide potential sources for a study to assess the best path(s) forward to advancing mission capabilities.</span></p>

Core to this is to understand the volumetric permittivity and permeability (electrical and magnetic properties) for a plasma or ionized gas. The electrical and magnetic properties will be leveraged to derive the dielectric constants for volumetric plasmas and ionized gases. Those dielectric constants will be formulated into RADAR cross sections that will be used for detection and tracking of plasmas or ionized gases.</span></p>

<CONTACT>Jamie Gregar, 608-388-1007

<a href="mailto:jamie.gregar@us.army.mil">MICC - Fort McCoy (RC - North)</a>
<DESC>The Mission & Installation Contracting Command - Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Systems Atlanta, Inc Kennesay, GA to obtain an IDS5 Single Workstation Package. <br>  <br> The justification is as follows: Systems Atlanta, Inc. (SAI), using Independent Research and Development (IR&D), developed and provides the only known bi-directional software interface that directly connects STR-Speech Tech's (STR) digital information system products with SAI's Information Dissemination & Display System (IDS5). To ensure bi-directional communication, STR' StarCaster  Range Information System (RIS) software shares a common workstation hardware platform and display with SAI's IDS5 software product suite and is launched from within IDS5. SAI's IDS5 and STR's Digital RIS, to include the IDS5 RIS Interface, is the only software suite that is accredited for use on all US Army, US Air Force local area networks (LAN) via the Army (AAAS) and Air Force (AFAS) Airfield Automation Systems program. SAI is the only source for IDS5 software products and services, and currently does not provide interfaces to any other Digital RIS product.  To support the interaction and real time transfer of critical information between Air Traffic Control and Range Operations/controllers. Currently Range Operations inputs the information into the Range Information System, which in turn broadcasts the hazardous conditions to aircraft. The range operations personnel then call the Air Traffic Control tower to update them of the same information. This typically happens for each range, drop zone, artillery firing point, mortar point or landing zone that either starts firing or becomes active with an event that is hazardous to non-participating aircraft. Both systems were designed by Systems Atlanta, and PM-ATC provides the updates to the AAAS, which will fall under the existing maintenance contract. The system is also approved under the NEC structure and connectivity protocol.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to issue a sole source modification to an existing contract for gravity gradiometers under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The modification to this contract will add two additional options totaling 27 months to the period of performance and incorporate requirements for field operations into the scope. These field operations support test, evaluation, and enhancement of gradiometer system performance. The total value of this change is approximately $650,000. This contract is for the continued support (e.g. repairs, testing, and technical support) to the R&amp;D gravity gradiometers that are exclusively developed by Lockheed Martin MS2. This support requires highly-specialized knowledge and experience available exclusively from the designer and developer of these complex instruments. In addition to the support, limited development of R&amp;D enhancements are required as the science continues to evolve that would maximize performance of current NGA owned gravity gradiometers, providing funding is available for such enhancements.

This proposed procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than June 28th, 2013, 12:00 p.m. Central Standard Time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Point of contact Lisa Braund, Contract Specialist, e-mail: lisa.m.braund.mil@mail.mil   <br>  <br> The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6). <br>  <br> K Force Government Solutions Inc. is the only vendor in the commercial market that offers this product. It was researched and developed under the Severe Trauma Simulation Army Technology Objective (ATO), TraumaFX was engineered specifically to meet the rigorous requirements of military and civilian training needs. Jointly developed with the U.S. Army RDECOM-ARL-STTC, Trauma FX leverages in-depth human factors requirements analyses of military and civilian training needs to deliver powerfully realistic, yet easy to use training solutions that can be deployed to any location and operated in nearly any weather condition.  <br> This manikin fits onto the upper portion of the manikin that the requiring activity currently has.  The TraumaFX HEMO manikin is the only manikin in the industry that offers human motion animatronics to create a lifelike training environment supplying lifelike visual and tactile stimuli with lifelike responses to treatment.  This manikin is the only one that can be worn on human actors. It has specially formulated reusable synthetic tissue with unparalleled realism and durability.  It is designed to anatomically correct exact human bloodlines (arterial, venous, and inguinal). It has a four hour battery life, allowing the instructors to take the unit to the field for training.  It can be reset in 15 seconds.  It uses off-the-shelf batteries. The animatronics give a degree of control to the instructor to advance a training scenario. Students will learn how to find lifelike anatomical landmarks to execute critical patient treatment without relying on marked indicators. The sole source will avoid duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or the unacceptable delays due to the government. The purchase of any other unit would reduce the training that the Trauma FX is able to provide.

<DESC><p>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER and is not a request for competitive proposals. The Department of Commerce/NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service has a requirement for a Scientific Programmer/Satellite Data Analyst and intends to negotiate with and issue a sole source, firm-fixed price award to John E. O'Reilly, 71 Pleasant Street, North Kingston, RI 02852-5019 to work with existing, and develop new, Interactive Data Language (IDL) code for the acquisition, processing, and analysis of satellite remote sensing data. The award will be made using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(A), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(2).</p>
<p>NEFSC has an ongoing research program to use remotely-sensed data collected by satellites to monitor the spatial, seasonal, inter-annual and decadal variability in sea surface temperature and phytoplankton productivity of the Northeast United States continental shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME), and understand how oceanographic variability influences fisheries productivity and the living marine resources within this region.</p>
<p>The requirement of this purchase order is for the contractor to have institutional knowledge of the existing IDL processing codes, which consists of more than 4,000 functions and programs. Mr. O'Reilly is uniquely qualified to perform the task of revising and updated the IDL programs because he has almost 20 years of experience programming in IDL and was responsible for designing and writing most of the code used by the Narragansett satellite data processing group.</p>
<p>In order to complete the statement of work within the period of performance, the contractor must have institutional knowledge of the existing programming and processing infrastructure. A contractor without this institutional knowledge would require significant additional training time to learn how the satellite data are processed, the specialized methodology of working with satellite and oceanographic data and to become familiar with the existing processing codes. It is anticipated that Mr. O'Reilly's experience and working knowledge will be a significant savings to the Government because he will be able to complete the tasks in a much shorter time frame.</p>
<p>The associated North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712 and the business size standard is 500 employees. This will be awarded with a base year and one option year period.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:   Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 02, Human Resources, Syracuse Medical Center.  It is the intent of VISN 2 Human Resources for the Syracuse Medical Center, 800 Irving Avenue, Syracuse, NY to sole source this requirement to The Graduate School USA (Vendor #4576).  2237 transaction number is 528-13-3-7709-0020.  

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:   This is a request for conference registration and fees, for three TCF HR Interns to attend the "Federal Labor Relations" conference in Washington, DC.  Dates of the conference are June 18, 2013 through June 21, 2013.  This is a firm, fixed price procurement.  The registration fee for each of the TCF Interns to attend this conference is $1,295.00 each, for a total of $3,885.00. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:   Services requested are to register three TCF HR Interns for this conference.  Each registration fee is $1,295.00 (x three = $3,885.00).  Registration is through vendor known as The Graduate School USA (Vendor #4576).  The TCF HR Interns who will be attending the conference will be David Janczyk, Evon Francis, and Kathryn Impelizzieri, all VA TCF HR Intern employees.  This is a fully-funded training authorized by Mark Antinelli, HR Manager to meet the TCF Intern program requirements, and funded under FCP 7709.  This conference is a four-day conference, June 18-21, 2013.  

Graduate School USA - http://www.graduateschool.edu/course_details.php?cid=STAF7009D
 
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(x ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1) - The Graduate School USA is the only vendor offering the "Federal Labor Relations" Conference for four (4) days within our required timeframe.  The information and knowledge the TCF HR Interns will gain by attending this particular conference is invaluable as a result of the time available to cover more in-depth material relative to "Federal Labor Relations."  

Given the complicated nature of Federal Labor Relations and its interaction not only with established policies and procedures, but also legal rules and regulations, it is imperative that all courses on the subject be capable of sustaining the breadth of knowledge required for such a topic.  From reviewing the other programs at comparable institutes, it is our understanding that the Graduate School USA is the only one who tries to bridge the gap between Policy, Practice, and Law.  They cover not only the areas of negotiations and process, as most other programs do, but also devote a significant portion to Labor Relations Laws, legal wording, and their effect on the Labor Relations process.  Poorly trained practitioners of Labor Relations open the VA up to severe legal ramifications.  It is mandatory that any program selected to train employees in this area have a scope broad enough to cover such diverse areas of Labor Relations Law, as well as the general tools and negotiation techniques that are common to every course of this nature.  This, coupled with the fact that The Graduate School USA offers the longest course available from any of its competitors, reflects that they are prepared to take the time to dig deep and ensure that all attendees are properly trained in such diverse broad-reaching subjects.  These facts make The Graduate School USA the obvious choice among competitors.


6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:   Current market analysis shows The Graduate School USA to be the best conference for the TCF HR Interns to attend due to length of the conference and the price.  Other available vendors are more costly to the Government and/or shorter in duration.  

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The price has been determined fair and reasonable in comparison to past costs to the government procured via 2237 number 528-13-1-7709-0007 at $1,395.00 per person.  The Graduate School USA cost for this conference is $1,295.00 per person or $323.75 per day.  The lowest cost other available vendors would charge is $300.00 per day for a two-day conference.  The total cost of $1,295.00 charged by The Graduate School USA is the same price offered to the public.  

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research has been conducted.  The price offered by The Graduate School USA is competitive with industry standards.  Other available vendors were researched and found to be more costly for these services and shorter in duration.   

9.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:   Other vendors researched by HR staff and the Education Department were the following:  Human Resources Institute (2-day, $395.00 per person), Federal Labor Relations Authority (2-day, $300.00 per person), and the Federal Management Institute (1-day, $395.00 per person).  The Graduate School USA offers the best inclusive program for the price.  

10.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  No action is planned at this time.  This conference for "Federal Labor Relations" is not a recurring event; there are no foreseen barriers for future services.  

11.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Queries to FedBizOpps produced publication of sole-source awards, research at FPDS and USAspending returned results from other VA Medical Centers around the country, all of which are using the same resource, AAMC, for professional development and resource navigation. The resource is available commercially to both public and private sector entities.


9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  The Stratton VA Medical Center has been paying this annual membership for many years. This has provided a high level of professional development, information sharing and affiliation development. It affords the Stratton VAMC success in retaining highly qualified individuals to provide care and treatment to the Veterans we serve.


10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None;
      if any other national membership resource is available and endorsed by the Office of   
      Academic Affiliations, their service will be considered.


11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The goal is to provide efficient and affordable health care for patients throughout VA.  Accordingly, if any other national membership resource is available and endorsed by the Office of Academic Affiliations, their service will be considered.


12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Direct Inward Dial (DID) and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/.

The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground RTP Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Office (ARO), is issuing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), W911NF-13-R-0010, for the establishment of Research in Quantum Computing.   There are two separate research topics covered in this announcement:  <br> 1.	Quantum characterization, verification, and validation <br> The Quantum Characterization, Verification, and Validation (QCVV) research topic seeks proposals addressing the development of theoretical and experimental techniques, procedures, and methods for characterizing few-qubit systems with a focus on metrics relevant to robust fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). The ultimate goal is to develop a set of standards and procedures, together with experimental demonstration, that will aid in characterizing increasingly complex quantum information systems. <br> 2.	Advanced quantum computing measurement technology  <br> Quantum information systems utilize measurement in a variety of ways: for diagnostic purposes while calibrating a quantum information system, to tune up a process for optimal operation, and for final read-out when implementing a quantum information process. Three performance parameters characterize quantum computing measurement techniques: (1) speed, (2) fidelity, and (3) resources. The overall objective is to demonstrate novel qubit measurement techniques for existing qubits. <br>  <br> This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) which sets forth research areas of interest to the Army Research Laboratory- Army Research Office (ARL-ARO) is issued under paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and 10 USC 2358 which provides for the competitive selection of basic research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provision of Public Law 98-369,  quote mark The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 quote mark  and subsequent amendments.  It is anticipated the awards will be made in the form of contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements and are subject to the availability of appropriations.   <br>  <br> The Research in Quantum Computing BAA will contain additional information along with instructions for white paper and proposal preparation and submission. White Papers are due via e-mail to usarmy.rtp.aro.mbx.baa3@mail.mil and must be received at the Army Research Office by 4:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time on Wednesday, 10 July 2013.  Proposals must be received by Grants.gov no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time on Tuesday, 10 September 2013.  <br>  <br> The BAA is available for viewing at the following address:  <br>  <br> http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=8  <br>  <br> The BAA is also posted in grants.gov. Go to the grants.gov site at the following URL http://www07.grants.gov/applicants/find_grant_opportunities.jsp then search by Funding Opportunity Number (FON) W911NF-13-R-0010. <br>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.102 (g) and with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The Solicitation number is OPM3313Q0002 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-66 dated April 1, 2013.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 518210, and the small business size standard is $30 million. This procurement is being reserved exclusively for Small Businesses in accordance with FAR Part 19.</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement Services (RS) provides Federal employees, retirees, and their families with a benefit program and services that offer choice, value, and quality to help maintain the government's position as a competitive employer. RS consists of one program, Retirement Operations, and four offices that report directly to the Associate Director: Quality Assurance, Benefits Officer Training &amp; Development, Retirement Policy, and Resource Management.</p>
<p>In support of this mission, RS has a need to obtain National Change of Address (NCOA) matching/processing for the entire annuity role of approximately 2.7 mailing addresses/customers on a monthly basis. The process is run on two files that OPM supplies to the contractor entitled: "ARANRP EFT" and "ARANRP PCA". The contractor shall be required to run a "Move Update" process on those files detailing "addressees who have moved in the last 4-years".</p>
<p>The NCOA address and zip code updates will help OPM/Retirement Services save on mailing costs, insure better mail delivery and conform to the USPS standardization of mail requirements. It's estimated that approximately forty million Americans move their place of residence and/or business annually, but their old addresses often remain in mailer's databases. As a result, mailings continue to go to old addresses and not the new ones. It is estimated that at least 8% of all mail is undeliverable because of incorrect addresses.</p>
<p>OPM intends to award one Fixed Price Purchase Order to the offeror that represents the best value to the government. The Period of Performance (POP) shall be three years (base year and two (2) one-year option periods). The base period will begin on or near the date of award.</p>
<p><strong>Only e-mailed requests for additional information will be accepted at Vito.Bertucci@opm.gov through 12:00 PM, EST, June 17, 2013. </strong></p>
<p>Offerors are invited to submit their quotations to the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Contracting Group in response to this notice by 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), June 24, 2013. Quotations submitted in response to this notice shall include the solicitation number in the subject line and be signed, dated and submitted via email to Vito.Bertucci@opm.gov.</p>
<p>Technical and Pricing quotations MUST be in two separate volumes. Each of the parts shall be separate and complete, so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of and concurrently with the evaluation of the others. If your technical and price quotation is not submitted in two separate files, your response to this solicitation will be considered non-responsive and withdrawn from consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Interested offerors must submit their technical and price quotations in separate files via email to: Vito.Bertucci@opm.gov by 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), June 24, 2013. </strong></p>
<p>Communications: All communications shall be directed to the attention of:</p>
<p>Name: Vito Bertucci<br />Title: Contracting Specialist<br />Vito.Bertucci@opm.gov</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: COMMUNICATIONS WITH OFFICIALS OTHER THAN THE OPM CONTRACTING OFFICIAL INDICATED ABOVE, MAY COMPROMISE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THIS ACQUISITION AND RESULT IN THE CANCELLATION OF THE SOLICITATION.</strong></p>
<p>Vendors not registered or whose registrations aren't active in the System for Award Management (SAM) database by <strong>June 24, 2013</strong> will not be considered for award. Vendors may register with SAM by calling 1-866-606-8220, or by accessing www.sam.gov.<br /><br /><strong>Please see the attached RFQ document for the full solicitation.</strong></p>

When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?

Manufacturer's Part Number 
Offeror must ensure the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Manufacturer Part Number or Wholesaler Number for each product proposed reflects the actual part number assigned.  If the OEM, Manufacturer, or Wholesaler Part Number is submitted incorrectly or not submitted, the product offering will not be awarded.
 
*Frustrated Freight 
 
Offer must maintain an order tracking system that permits ordering agencies to obtain the location of an order from the time the order is shipped to the time/point of delivery and acceptance at end point of point of delivery.  
 
Offeror must also demonstrate understanding of an order bound for an international end point delivery and provide a sample electronic version of an appropriately marked label in accordance with the FED-STD-123 and MIL-STD-129 edition in effect at the date of issuance of the solicitation.

Full Products and Broad Services Offerings 

Offeror must provide a full and broad offering on services and/or products. Offers will not be accepted with only limited item/offering (product, labor category, training course, or fixed-price service) unless it represents a total solution for the Special Item Numbers (SINs). 
 
Fair and Reasonable Pricing

To determine fair and reasonable pricing, the GSA Contracting Officer may consider many factors, including pricing on competitor contracts, historical pricing, and currently available pricing in other venues.  Offers which provide Most Favored Customer pricing, but which are not highly competitive will not be found fair and reasonable and will not be accepted.  

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 6 months before your offer is evaluated. 

Description:
This is a standing solicitation for Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) 72 FURNISHING AND FLOOR COVERINGS. This solicitation will be available electronically-only and includes all current applicable clauses. Interested parties may access the solicitation at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

Solicitation: This document includes all contract clauses and should be downloaded for future reference. It also includes Supplemental Instructions for preparing a proposal.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract.

(2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors.

The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>The Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), measures ocean currents.  It must have 4 acoustic transducers capable of measuring currents to a distance of 2 to 100 meters from the instrument.  4 beams are required to allow currents to be resolved into a 3 component velocity vector and provide additional information for an error detection and correction algorithm which is used in real-time processing to reject outlier points on a ping to ping, bin by bin basis. The instrument must have selectable vertical spatial resolution of .5 to 8 meter bin size, and have a ping rate of up to 10 Hz for individual velocity pings.  Velocity must be resolved to .1 m/.s with accuracy of .5% +/- .5 cm./s and single ping standard deviation must be 15 cm/s or less for a 1 meter bin size.
  The instrument must also be capable of measuring instrument tilt in a range of +/- 15 degrees with an accuracy of +/- .5 degrees and resolution of .01 degrees, and capable of measuring instrument heading accurate to +/- 2 degrees and resolution of .01 degrees to allow velocities to be corrected for instrument tilt and heading.  Temperature measurement range must be -2 to 40 degrees C, with accuracy of .5 degrees C and resolution of .01 degrees C.  The instrument must have an operating temperature range of -2 to 40 degrees C, and storage temperature range of -30 to 60 degrees C and a depth rating of 200 meters.  Communications must be via RS232 with baud rate in the range of 9600 to 57600 baud and data must be retrievable in real-time.

<DESC><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

STATEMENT OF WORK


1.0 Scope.   The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) requires the repair of the RTA-4114 Weather Radar listed in the Schedule of Supplies/Services. The contractor shall be either an FAA approved repair station, OEM Certified facility or have an ISO: 9001-2008 Certification and meet IPC-A-610 Standards as a minimum requirement.

Repair work shall be performed in accordance with the OEM Commercial Maintenance Manuals, latest revision for the following components:

Item 1, RTA-4114 Weather Radar
P/N: 822-2255-001
S/N: 3Y2KG

Item 2, RTA-4114 Weather Radar
P/N: 822-2255-001
S/N: 3Y2VX

Item 3, RTA-4114 Weather Radar
P/N: 822-2255-001
S/N: 3Y2WD

The USCG will ship the component to the contractors facility to be repaired at the Firm Fixed Prices established in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.

2.0 Requirement.  The contractor shall provide all parts, labor, tooling, test equipment and facilities necessary to repair the RTA-4114 Weather Radar listed in the Schedule of Supplies/Services at the firm-fixed price established in the Purchase Order for each Line Item. The contractor shall perform a visual and technical inspection in accordance with the OEM Commercial Maintenance Manuals and correct all additional deficiencies found.  This work shall include repair of all related components and include replacement of missing or broken parts and the removal of any foreign matter or corrosion.

2.1 Corrosion.  USCG aircraft operate primarily around salt water, at low altitude, and are subject to corrosion.  Therefore, corrosion should be expected and should be factored in the firm-fixed repair price.  Should corrosion be found during initial inspection and functional testing, disassembly shall be made to the extent necessary to remove all corrosion or replace the part(s) affected.  Corroded parts shall be replaced, except in those cases where removal of corrosion from parts will not impair efficiency or safe operation.  Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas shall be accomplished in accordance with the OEM standards and specifications or best commercial practices if not addressed by the OEM Commercial Maintenance Manuals.

3.0 Serviceable and Replacement Parts.  Parts of a component found to be in a serviceable condition as a result of inspection and functional testing shall be re-used.  Missing parts or parts found to be defective shall be replaced with new parts that meet or exceed the OEM specifications.  Only new replacement parts with traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) are acceptable for this requirement.

4.0 Unusual Damage and Cannibalization.  The firm fixed repair price established in the Schedule of Supplies/Services does not include components that have been severely damaged due to abuse, misuse, mishandling, crash damage, cannibalization of repairable components/assemblies or acts of God.   Those components may be determined unusually damaged.  The USCG will not authorize requests for over and above price requests for additional parts or labor when the above criteria are not met to the satisfaction of the USCG.  When a component is processed for Unusual Damage Evaluation the contractor shall, within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the equipment, submit to the Contracting Officer a written inspection condition report and a fixed price repaired quote covering all parts and repairs needed to return the equipment to serviceable condition that meets all applicable OEM specifications. The quote shall include a listing of the replacement parts and/or material required, the cost of each required replacement part, the number of labor hours and hourly labor rates, and the time needed to perform the repair and return the equipment to serviceable Ready-For-Issue (RFI) condition.

The Contractors delivery obligation shall stop from the date of notification that an item has been determined to be a candidate for Unusual Damage Evaluation.   Upon mutual agreement as to price and delivery, a modification to the Purchase Order will be issued to authorize the work at the agreed upon terms or, if the work is not desired by the Government, disposition instructions for the non-repaired equipment.

5.0 Flight Critical Equipment and Airworthiness Certification.  Not Applicable.  The RTA-4114 Weather Radar is not classified as Flight Critical.

In the event of an AOG/WS situation, the Purchase Order and applicable Line Item Number will be modified as needed to reflect the USCG delivery address and the applicable USCG Requisition Number.   The Contractor shall be required to ensure the Requisition Number is included on shipping documents/delivery tickets so that the Material Receipt can be processed by the applicable USCG receiving personnel.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>1. Federal Student Aid (FSA), a component of the Department of Education (DoED), continues to advance its Enterprise Identity Management System (EIMS) initiative, under which it has been engaged in systematically upgrading legacy capabilities external users' interface with to access FSA data and evolving its security approach to ensure all of its security capabilities interoperate and function as a unified enterprise asset.</p>
<p>2. The next phase of the EIMS initiative involves replacing the PIN application, by&nbsp;non-privileged users to&nbsp;register and access their data residing on FSA systems, with a&nbsp;capability that satisfies requirements stated in the SOO, see Attachment D-1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Small businesses responding to this Phase 1 RFP are reminded that this is a FAR Part 12 procurement action. Accordingly, the RFP consists of Parts A through E. Specific instructions and evaluation criteria are contained in Part E. Following completion of Phase 1, a Phase 2 RFP will prepared and sent ONLY to competitors continued into Phase 2. The Phase 2 RFP will consist of the Phase 1 RFP Parts A through D, as may be subsequently revised, and a new Part E. The contract the government intends to award, as a result of this competition, will NOT include the Phase 2 Part E and, as appropriate,&nbsp;Parts A through D content may be revised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4.&nbsp; Please note, the change posted 13 June 2013,&nbsp;adds a consolidated listing of questions received and answers provided to these questions. This listing should be closely reviewed,&nbsp; for completeness and currency, as answers previously provided to questions, may have been updated, based on more current information.&nbsp;If a reviewer believes a question asked has not be answered,&nbsp;please immediately notify, via email, the points of contact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. As stated in answers to questions and noted the below response section, this&nbsp;change also revises the proposal submission cutoff time and date&nbsp;to 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Monday 17 June 2013 and, though not specifically asked as a question, clarifies that FSA will NOT count copies of quality type certifications as part of the 10-page limitation stated stated in&nbsp;Phase 1 RFP Part E.3.3.c.</p>
<p>6. Please note, a lot of the information provided in answers to questions can also be found in the RFP Parts A through E. As previously stated, this Phase 1 RFP represents the first step of a competitive 2-step procurement process. The goal during this first step is to identify and qualify, for continuation into Phase 2, the competitors whose Phase 1 proposals and related information provide the government a high degree of confidence that the competitor will be able to effectively satisfy the requirements stated in the Phase 1 RFP SOO (Attachment D-1).</p>
<p>7. Lastly, please note that&nbsp;when the government uses a SOO, it is intentionally&nbsp;avoiding&nbsp;instructing potential providers as to what capability must be proposed&nbsp;and how these capabilities must be provided.&nbsp;Instead,&nbsp;it is focusing on outcomes and&nbsp;seeking to have the commercial marketplace&nbsp;propose capabilities that will satisfy stated SOO requirements. Existing legacy capabilities tend to have unique profiles which due technological changes and other factors, may have little or no relevance to more current capabilities&nbsp;that could be proposed, which&nbsp;due to these advances, may offer&nbsp;more operationally and cost effective profiles. Accordingly,&nbsp;when using a SOO approach, much of the information about the specific profile of a&nbsp;legacy capability, may not be relevant.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">***MODIFICATION 001 TO THE SOLICITATION: The purpose of this modification is to attach Q&amp;A for interested vendors.***</span></strong><br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number is 10693F1228 and is issued as a Request For Quote, unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-66. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210 with a small business size standard of $25 Million. This requirement is restricted to total small business and only qualified offerors may submit quotes. THIS IS AN ALL OR NOTHING QUOTE. PARTIAL OR INCOMPLETE OFFERS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR CONSIDERED.
<p>Background:<br />The Diplomatic Security Office of Training and Performance Standards (DS/T/TPS) handles 20+ classrooms, 100+ vehicles and 1,000's of pieces of individual equipment for thousands of students yearly. Class lengths and sizes vary widely, as do their meeting cycles. There are four TPS facilities located in three states. Class loads will soon be increasing to meet recent Accountability Review Board recommendations. At present there are multiple individual and public Excel spreadsheets (nonstandard in construction, functions and level of usage), SharePoint calendars, wax boards and clipboards that are used to schedule and track reservations and activities. Very specialized single purpose scheduling systems have also been internally developed.</p>
<p>A TPS resource scheduling application is needed to consolidate all of the TPS resource and scheduling data and provide a consistent interface for an estimated 30 administrators and managers (we are not looking for software development, as we are looking for a customizable software application). A TPS Resource Scheduler tool will need to run across OpenNet to all of the TPS training locations and permit system managers to view and use the same information in all locations. The tool will also be able to produce retrospective reports and projections.</p>
<p>The Department of State has a requirement for a resource scheduling software application, remote installation and integration, training, and maintenance and support (4 years), on a Meet or Exceeds basis, to the following:</p>
<p>A. Minimum Interoperability Requirements:<br />1. We require the ability to install the software on vendor agnostic hardware purchased and maintained by DOS personnel running Microsoft Windows 2008 R2.<br />2. The product must provide the ability to operate without an active internet connection. Product updates must be available for download as a flat file, which can then be transferred using CD or IronKey USB drive. Because the Scheduler will not permit external contact, maintenance updates, if any, will have to be done via hard media (disk or IronKey). <br />3. The product must install and run within DOS OpenNet support seats in all TPS locations.<br />4. The product must interface with DOS SharePoint (MOSS 10) and Outlook 10.<br />5. The underlying database(s) must be commonly used ones such as SQL, Oracle or DB2 and run in the MS Windows 2008 R2 environment.</p>
<p>B. Minimum Performance Functions (for the Customizable Software Application Tool):<br />1. The TPS Resource Scheduler will use a web interface supporting MS IE 7 and up or Google Chrome.<br />2. The product must have an unlimited scheduling capacity for the TPS resource types (e.g., sedan cars, SUV's, and classrooms at each location) and the total number of resources in each type (e.g., 35 cars, 74 SUV's and 9 classrooms at ITF).<br />3. The product must link and associate resources such that a higher level resource (a classroom or race track) can be defined as "coming with" lower level resources (PC's or safety equipment or medical support)<br />4. The product must manage TPS resources using object qualities and business rules.<br />5. The product must support scheduling of expendable and reusable resources.<br />6. The product must support licensed admin or management seats through hierarchical permissions including inheritance.<br />7. The permission structure must support unlimited read-only users without extra costs.<br />8. The product must integrate with DOS Active Directory to support notifications.<br />9. The product must support use of imagery, schematics and other graphics to facilitate end user understanding and insights.<br />10. The following options must be available within the scheduler:<br />a. "Self Scheduling" of a resource with no other manager/admin input<br />b. "Resource Request" for a resource that requires admin approval<br />c. "Resource Assignment" for a resource that is assigned by an admin<br />d. "Recurrence Scheduling" for resource reservations that occur many times<br />e. "Linked Scheduling" for multiple resources that are grouped into one entity <br />11. Reporting of scheduling, utilization and other resource metrics must be available through an internal (vendor) tool or through an add-on such as Crystal Reports. Inclusion of a reporting tool must be part of the product bid.<br />12. A "what-if" or other projection mode must be part of the product to support TPS resource planners in estimating and projecting effects of changes in TPS student loads and course offerings.</p>
<p>C. Minimum Vendor Requirements:<br />1. The vendor has a demonstrable experience in providing service similar to this Requirement to other clients of a similar size.<br />2. The vendor has experience in providing service to U.S. Government clients.<br />3. TPS requires that in the offer the vendor will assist in providing, documentation and demonstration of the purchased technology to assist in accomplishing the internal DOS IT Review Board acceptance of the software on the DOS Intranet (OpenNet.)<br />4. The vendor will provide detailed operation manuals to support TPS standalone operation of the scheduling tool.<br />5. TPS requires the product bid includes initial setup and direct integration assistance in bringing all planned TPS resources into the scheduling tool. Integration will include connectivity with current DOS IT systems (e.g., Outlook). All direct installation and integration efforts must be completed remotely.<br />6. The initial resource setup phase (installation and integration-resource transfer from end user to vendor's software) will be for a period of no less than six weeks of assistance by dedicated vendor personnel.<br />7. The vendor will integrate resource data into the vendor software and convey that to TPS for installation in the TPS instance. This can be done by disk, IronKey or FTP for upload into the TPS instance. No direct Internet connection will be possible.<br />8. Before and during initial setup the vendor will provide training and guidance to designated TPS personnel so that future assets can be added by TPS without reliance on the vendor. Vendor must recommend and provide training for no less than 30 TPS personnel to become subject matter experts for scheduling various resources (classrooms, vehicles, personal equipment, etc.) Training can be onsite or by remote delivery. Vendor must recommend and provide on-site training for five system managers. Vendor should recommend the training type for post-integration and pre-installation. <br />9. In addition to the initial setup the vendor will provide ongoing support by telephone or e-mail Monday-Friday between the hours of 0800 - 2000 Eastern Time with an option of five years of support.<br />10. Vendor must provide hardware specifications to support the software which will meet the requirements. Please specify and provide detailed descriptions, so that DoS can determine if said hardware is not currently in use and will need to be acquired.</p>
<p>Prospective vendors are strongly recommended to respond using the above minimum requirements as a template (providing extensive descriptions and/or illustrations--fully laying out the integration process, etc.) and to also follow the pricing structure indicated as follows (make adjustments as necessary/expand CLINS):<br />CLIN DoS Description <br />0001 Resource Scheduling Software <br />0002 Installation, Integration, Implementation, and Training Services <br />0003 Maintenance and Support (Base) <br />1003 Maintenance and Support (OY1) <br />2003 Maintenance and Support (OY2) <br />3003 Maintenance and Support (OY3)<br />--Offeror may replace DoS Description with Vendor Descriptions, Part Numbers, Unit Prices and Quantities, etc.--</p>
<p>***Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible, preferably 72 hours before the close of this notice, to enable the Buyer to respond. Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered. We respectfully request that prospective vendors not make any assumptions.***</p>
<p>In addition to providing pricing for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical descriptions, past performance, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation. Anyone other than the manufacturer, offering the name-brand manufactured products, must provide proof (letter from manufacturer or URL to manufacturer's specific web page confirming authorization as a reseller) that they are an authorized distributor.</p>
<p>An evaluation will be conducted based on best value, where delivery schedule offered, technical compliance as defined by staying as close to the listed specifications as identified, and past performance are more important than price. However, as delivery schedule, technical compliance, and past performance become equal, award will be made on the basis of lowest price. All unit rates should include all costs including shipping to Dunn Loring, VA 22027.</p>
<p>This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to FAR 4.1102 and other applicable regulations and guidelines. Information can be found at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>All Quotes must be valid for a minimum of 30 days from the closing date for this solicitation. No exceptions or qualifications.</p>
<p>New equipment ONLY, NO grey market or refurbished products. Items must be in original packaging, never used, and not altered in any way. Components of the requested equipment, to include memory, must be manufacturer-approved and may not be compatible, remanufactured, or refurbished equipment. All items must be covered by manufacturer's warranty and procured through a manufacturer approved distribution channel. Sellers must be able to document their ability to provide items through manufacturer approved distribution channels upon request. The Seller confirms to have sourced all products submitted in this quote from manufacturer-approved channels for Federal sales, in accordance with all applicable laws and manufacturer's current applicable policies at the time of purchase. Seller must be able to support both the product sale and product pricing, in accordance with applicable manufacturer certification/specialization requirements.</p>

<DESC>Posting	This Market Survey is issued In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) Paragraph 3.2.1.2.1 (Market Analysis), to determine whether adequate competition exists to conduct a full and open competition to meet the Voice Recorder Replacement Program (VRRP) fielding and support requirements from 2014-2017.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  The Federal Aviation Administration is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

As FAA approaches the end of the VRRP fielding schedule, this requirement is for the procurement and installation of a small number (approximately 8) of standardized Digital Audio Legal Recorder (DALR) systems for new air traffic control towers currently under construction; and perform expansions of existing systems as required;.  The DOD (Air Force, Army and Navy) may order several systems depending on budget constraints.  The period of performance for this requirement is anticipated to be 3 years, from May 1, 2014 to April 30, 2017 with two one-year option periods exercisable entirely at the FAAs discretion.  The FAA currently has a contract with Nice Systems, Inc., to produce, install, train and sustain systems at FAA and DOD locations.  The current contract (DTFAWA-07-C-00029) was awarded to Nice Systems, Inc., Paramus, NJ, on April 30, 2007 following a full and open competition.  To date, 448 DALR systems have been delivered to the FAA and 227 DALR systems have been delivered to the DOD.

To successfully perform this requirement and minimize risk to the FAA, potential vendors must have:

1.  A voice recorder system that meets all the VRRP system Specification requirements (attached).

2.  A voice recorder system that has completed the FAAs Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E), Independent Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) and In-Service Decision (ISD) review processes.

3.  A current production facility to produce the voice recorder systems in the quantities required.  

4.  An installation and training infrastructure and capability to support installation, checkout and acceptance requirements. 

5.  FAA approved technical documentation and training in place to support the VRRP.

6.  Record of recorder sales within the last 3 years that supports the presence of the proposed product in the marketplace. Including systems provided to the FAA and DOD. Vendors are also required to provide three (3) references that the FAA can contact to verify sales and performance of the product.  

Interested vendors must respond with a Capability Statement of experience and proven capabilities in meeting the above items and performing in an Air Traffic environment.  The Capability Statement must clearly demonstrate that the vendor has a VRRP Specification-conforming recording product and is capable of providing the required services.  The format for the Capability Statement is at the vendors' discretion, but no more than 20 pages including charts/diagrams.  Brochures and preexisting documentation will not be attributed to the 20 page count.  In order to be considered as an acceptable source, vendors must meet all the requirements listed in items 1 through 6 above.  Vendors that do not meet all the requirements listed in items 1 through 6 above will be determined to be unacceptable. 

For information planning purposes, a new voice recorder procurement termed the NAS Voice Recorder will be initiated in 2015 to acquire the next generation of voice recorders that will interface and be compatible with the NAS Voice System (NVS) NextGen program, which is currently entering its Demonstration phase.  The NAS Voice Recorder procurement will incorporate NextGen requirements and will undergo its Requirements Definition phase in the 2015-2016 timeframe.  Development and release of the Screening Information Request (SIR), evaluation of vendor proposals and testing of vendor equipment is projected to conclude with a source selection and contract award in 2017.

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to the announcement.  Additionally, information provided in response to this announcement is for informational purposes only and will not be released.  If proprietary information is submitted it must be clearly marked in the responses.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Vendors believing they possess the capability to meet this requirement can respond to this announcement with your firms capabilities and experience.  Responses should be submitted no later than June 21, 2013, to Contracting Officer Charles McGovern via e-mail at: Charles.McGovern@faa.gov and Contract Specialist Dominic Lackey at dominic.lackey@faa.gov.
	
	The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited quotes or proposals.
	Questions concerning this announcement may be directed to Charles McGovern, Senior Contracting Officer, AAQ-320 at: Charles.McGovern@faa.gov and Contract Specialist Dominic Lackey at  dominic.lackey@faa.gov

<DESC>A Concession Business Opportunity for Lodging, Food &amp; Beverage and Retail Services at Mabry Mill and Rocky Knob within the Blue Ridge Parkway On March 8, 2013, the National Park Service (NPS) will issue a prospectus for solicitation of offers for a 10-year concession contract to provide for Lodging, Food &amp; Beverage and Retail Services at Mabry Mill and Rocky Knob. Mabry Mill Overview (Mile Post (MP) 176.2) Mabry Mill is one of Blue Ridge Parkways most popular visitor attractions due to its rich history and picturesque environment. Facilities at Mabry Mill include the historic gristmill, sawmill and blacksmith shop, which were built shortly after the turn of the 20th century and restored to provide visitors a view of pioneer life in Appalachia. A short trail connects these structures as well as provides informative exhibits and interpretive displays. Directly south of the historic area is the Mabry Mill Restaurant and Gift Shop, which caters not only to those stopping to view the mill, but also to visitors passing by and staying within the area. Other nearby Parkway attractions include a variety of recreational activities that include hiking, camping and picnicking. Rocky Knob Overview (Mile Post (MP) 174) The Rocky Knob recreation area has more than 3,500 acres of mostly rugged, forested terrain, including Rock Castle Gorge. An extensive trail system in Rock Castle Gorge, including the Rock Castle Gorge Loop Trail, a designated National Scenic Trail, provides excellent hiking and access to backcountry opportunities. The Concession Opportunity at Rocky Knob includes the seven Rocky Knob Cabins. The Cabins, with direct access to the southern entrance to Rock Castle Gorge, are historic structures constructed in 1941 by the Civilian Conservation Corps. First developed as trail lodges, the Cabins were remodeled for use as family housekeeping units in 1950. Today, the Cabins offer a relaxed visitor experience with close proximity to several natural, cultural and historical sites including the Gorges hiking trails, the historic Mabry Mill, and Fairy Stone State Park.

<DESC><strong>TITLE<br /></strong>Minority Institutions of Higher Education (MIHE) Government Contracting Workshop
<p><strong>ABOUT THIS WORKSHOP <br /></strong>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Secretary (OS), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) provides information for Minority Institutions of Higher Education (MIHE) that are interested in doing business with the Federal Government. This workshop was created to help MIHEs 1) become familiar with processes and procedures associated with federal government contracting; and 2) to identify and pursue contract opportunities with HHS. The objective of these workshops is to engage, equip, and inform the educational institution participants of the federal procurement process so that they become more effective in pursuing contracting opportunities at HHS. If you are not a MIHE, but are an educational institution of higher learning, and you would like to attend, please contact fedgovconworkshops@d2dinc.com.</p>
<p><strong>The workshop will cover:<br /></strong>Overview of the Federal Market/Procurement Process<br />Marketing to the Department of Health &amp; Human Services and Other Federal Agencies<br />Proposal Development<br />Price Proposal Development<br />Overview of Contract Compliance</p>
<p><strong>DATE &amp; LOCATION:<br /></strong></p>
<p>The workshop at Tidewater Community College in Norfolk, VA is being rescheduled. Date is TBD.&nbsp; Additional dates and times will be posted as soon as they become available. Please visit http://fedgovconworkshops.com/ for more information. The time of each workshop is different, so please visit the website.</p>
<p><strong>COST:</strong> FREE - there is no cost to register</p>
<p><strong>REGISTRATION<br /></strong>Pre-registration is required and limited. Registration will close when it is full. A link for each location is provided at http://fedgovconworkshops.com/.</p>
<p>If you register and cannot attend, please cancel your registration as soon as possible so that someone on the wait list can participate.</p>
<p>If you have questions regarding the event, please contact conference support at fedgovconworkshops@d2dinc.com.</p>
<p><strong>Who should attend?<br /></strong>MIHE faculty and staff who are interested in pursuing government contracts or who have initiated the process, but have not yet been successful should attend this workshop. Individuals already involved in government contracting should attend to gain additional knowledge about the process and to network with HHS staff attending the workshop. Faculty and staff from all types of MIHEs and other institutions of higher learning will find this workshop helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I attend?<br /></strong>The Federal Government is an excellent, and often times, untapped resource of revenue. In this economy, educational institutions need additional sources of revenue to supplement other funding efforts. This can be done by securing contracts to support government customers with a variety of services including areas such as research projects. MIHE faculty and staff should attend a workshop so they understand the government contracting environment and have the tools necessary to navigate the government processes.</p>
<p><strong>I'm a teacher and can't afford to miss class. Can I attend part of the workshop? <br /></strong>We understand that class schedules may overlap with the workshop schedule. This is a four-hour workshop scheduled in the afternoon/early evening in hopes to avoid most scheduling conflicts. We hope that you can join us for the entire event; however there is no requirement to attend the entire workshop. Come during the time that is convenient for your schedule.</p>
<p><strong>I already know the basics of government contract. My school already has government contracts. How will this workshop help me?<br /></strong>You may be familiar with the basics; however this workshop will delve deeper into govcon topics. This includes an overview of the federal market/procurement process; grants versus contracts; market research/opportunity identification; proposal development; understanding contract pricing; and overview of contract administration and compliance. You will also have the opportunity to interact with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) OSDBU representatives who will be on-site during the workshop.</p>

This Sources Sought is to determine the proper set-aside category for a solicitation for the Renovation of the Sterile Processing Services unit at the Albany VAMC.  The highest priority set-aside category with at least 3 responses (2 in the event of SDVOSB or VOSB) will be used in any forthcoming solicitation for this project.

(b) Although proposal, contractor, and offeror may be used in this sources sought notice, any response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.
(c) Any information received from a contractor in response to this Sources Sought may be used in creating a solicitation.  Any information received which is marked with a statement, such as "proprietary" or "confidential," intended to restrict distribution will not be distributed outside of the Government, except as required by law.

However, the estimated construction value of this project falls within the range of $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

		ii. Willingness to provide said bonds
iii. Intent to provide said bonds as well as a 20% bid bond upon submission of a proposal and/or subsequent award, for any resultant solicitation/award generated from this notice.

(4) A signed affirmation that your company has not been issued a show cause letter, cure notice, terminated for default, or been denied a Small Business Certificate of Competency in the past three years.
(5)  A certification that the bidder/offeror has no more than three (3) serious, or one (1) repeat or one (1) willful OSHA or any EPA violation(s) in the past three years.

As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2). <br>  <br> The contractor shall examine the consequences on increasing realistic weapons load by manipulation of the specific weapons emplyed by Warfighters (M4, M203, Squad Automatic Weapon) in relation to the torso loads necessary for tactical employment of these weapons.

The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
 If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the Naval Inventory Control Point (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
 Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S STATEMENT REGARDING <br />LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION <br />Digital KVM Extender System Maintenance Contract
<p>1.Identification of Agency and the Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>United States Forest Service, Region 5 Regional Aviation Group Flight Simulation Room</p>
<p>2.Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved:</p>
<p>The Government intends to purchase a Sole Source/Brand Name justification to procure the 2013 two fiscal quarter year Maintenance Coverage for HMX KVM over IP extender system equipment for the use in Region 5 Flight Simulation Training room.<br /><br />Brand Name Avocent/Emerson HMX KVM over IP extender system previously provided by Tenzing in the Flight Simulation Room for the maintenance of the previously professional unique installation of the listed parts for the Forest Service R5 McClellan training center flight simulation room. These include:</p>
<p>Quantity Part Number Description<br />2 each HMXMGR-G2-001 HMX Management Appliance<br />12 each HMX1070-001 HMX User Station Single HD DVI-I, Transmitter Kit- HMIQSHDI-001 Module Single HD-DVI, VGA<br />4 each HMX2050-001 HMX User Station Dual HD DVI-I A &amp; B<br />63 each HMIQDHDD-001 Transmitter Kit-HMXIQDHDD Module Dual HD, DVI-A, DVI-B <br />1 each MPU104E-001 4 Port- 1 Digital Path - SAC<br />4 each DSRIQ-USB2 (for use with MPU104E-001) Virtual media server interface module for VGA video and USB 2.0 with 14-inch cable.<br />The Maintenance contract shall appear as such:<br />Line Qty Part Number Description<br />1 2013 two fiscal quarter year Maintenance Coverage<br />2 8 To be Determined Maintenance and Support Services to include: (2) Days per quarter onsite support.<br />Firmware Updates-On Site and/or Remote Firmware Updates and Roll-Backs when released and appropriate for implementation as recommended by hardware/software manufacturer. Consultation and Preliminary IMPACT-STUDY in advance for proper scheduling.<br />Connectivity Issues / Resolutions<br />Design / Schema Changes &amp; Modifications (As Needed)<br />Remote Access Support-Whenever needed-this method will be used to help fix problems witnessed / validate anomalies and is available any time within the period covered a company's services.<br />Manufacturer Alert Notices and Hardware Change Notifications, Modifications, &amp; Recommendations.<br />Advance replacement for items listed above.</p>
<p>The above listed items were previously installed and now need a maintenance contract.<br />3.Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet Agency's Need Including the Estimated Value:</p>
<p>This equipment maintenance contract will need to be able to professionally monitor remotely (per the current remote access capability) the existing system without further modifications as well as meet current equipment specifications of brand name or equal to the product(s) noted. The HMX and DSR equipment listed above do have to be maintained to meet all specifications listed in order to be used at the highest network speed and firmware versions capable to accommodate streaming flight simulation for video output. Onsite installation and setup and training for new firmware are also mandatory normally. The Government is also aware factory warranty information for product(s) is evident with this obtained maintenance contract. There is an estimated value of $28,624.88.</p>
<p>4 Identification of the Justification Rationale (See FAR 6.302-1, and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply and service:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, One Responsible Source, it is determined that Tenzing/ECS is the sole distributor for the above name brand equipment and is required in order to meet the use needs of the R5 Flight simulation room requirements for this intricate HMX KVM system. Use of and experience after installing this product by this company in the first part of 2013 has proven said same company would be best fit and value for maintenance contract product. Tenzing/ECS has proven in an exemplary manner of being available to troubleshoot and repair in a very timely manner. The best part of the company reputation is the above and beyond work ethic it took to install the whole HMX KVM product. They just go further. Other companies have very narrow guidelines for troubleshooting and longer turnaround times for repairs. Furthermore, there is a huge need to keep the firmware standardized with the industry.</p>
<p>Brand Name - Avocent/Emerson HMX Digital KVM IP Extender System:</p>
<p>The procurement of Avocent/Emerson HMX KVM IP Extender System offers the following advantages to the agency:</p>
<p>The unique features of this particular HMX digital KVM IP Extender system meets the unique requirements needed for the R5 flight simulation to operate sufficiently. Tenzing/ECS can communicate to Avocent/Emerson Network Power to modify firmware by maintaining via contract the unique installation we have implemented. This has already been evidenced during the installation phase. Flight simulators are not in a static state and are the reason a KVM system is required with remote access, onsite visits and documentation updates. In addition the overwhelming majority of existing company's would not provide the high level of value Tenzing/ECS can. By remaining with Tenzing/ECS, the Forest Service enjoys the benefits of high level maintenance at our training facility, while also being able to work via remote access with appointed technician. They can keep the product at hand (i.e. remote access, phone or onsite) in a high level of operational capability.</p>
<p>5. Determination by the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer that the Order Represents the Best Value Consistent with 8.404(d):</p>
<p>The best value to the government is demonstrated by the need to keep standardization and substantial cost savings by not having to realign with another contractor. The best value is also obtained by the Forest Service by not having to teach another contractor the system design and equipment and due to specific features instituted by Tenzing/ECS during the original installation the Avocent/Emerson HMX KVM IP Extender System which include the additional features of remote access configuration. This last capability is important when planning to go to a larger scale with R5 Flight Simulators.</p>
<p>6. A Description of Market Research Conducted and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted:</p>
<p>Market research involved taking note of what the Technology bears in various maintenance contract styles over the years I have performed my duties as the SME for the R5 flight simulation room and assistant facility manager position previously. The Government would sustain substantial costs savings in entering into contract with this company. They are innovative, committed and the actual designer installer of this system.</p>
<p>7. Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification:</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>8. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers That Led to the Restricted Consideration Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services is Made:</p>
<p>This procurement is intended to be a one-time contract with options to renew if possible for the R5 Flight Simulation Room at McClellan training center.</p>

<DESC>The NIEHS, EDMP, Comparative Medicine Branch (CMB) has a requirement to extend the Animal Resources Section (ARS) for the centralized ordering of rodents. The ARS maintains procurement mechanisms with a broad range of commercial contractors for laboratory animals and animal services to support the research requirements of investigators within the NIEHS Intramural Research Program. Currently, HHSN273200800006I-9I are held by 4 incumbents. The IDIQ task order was awarded on June 16, 2008 and the total contract value negotiated was $22,971.972.00. The period of performance is June 16, 2008 - June 15, 2013. Under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, a three (3) month modification was executed to extend the task order from June 16, 2013 - September 15, 2013. This three month extension to the task order will enable the CMB to continue to provide vital services in support of the EDMP.
