<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for 3 ea. Radio Tuning Panels for VDL Mode 3 operation of VHF and HF airframe radios, Part No. G7424-302. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Gables Engineering, Inc. 247 Greco Avenue, Coral Gables, FL 33146. Reason for lack of competition is that the panels will be used to replace and upgrade components to existing in-house test and demonstration hardware previously purchased. Data available is not adequate to assure that this part, if procured from another manufacturer, will perform the same function in the equipment/system as the existing part to be replaced. Additionally, drawings or specifications of the interaction of this part are unavailable and thus insufficient to obtain competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 24, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in South Dakota requires the services of an Architect-Engineering (A-E) firm for the performance of legal boundary surveys.  This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  THIS PROCUREMENT is set aside for small business.  

PROJECT INFORMATION:

The government contemplates the award of 1-3 indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contracts in three areas of South Dakota resulting from this competition.  The three areas consist of the following:

Area 1:  Buffalo, Jerauld, Sanborn, Miner, Lake, Moody, Lyman, Brule, Aurora, Davison, Hanson, McCook, Minnehaha, Tripp, Gregory, Charles Mix, Douglas, Hutchinson, Turner, Lincoln, Bon Homme, Yankton, Clay and Union.

Area 2:  Brown, Marshall, Roberts, Day, Spink, Clark, Codington, Grant, Hamlin, Deuel, Beadle, Kingsbury, Brookings, Campbell, McPherson, Walworth, Edmunds, Potter, Faulk, Sully, Hughes, Hyde and Hand.

Area 3:  Harding, Perkins, Corson, Butte, Meade, Ziebach, Dewey, Haakon, Stanley, Jones, Mellette, Todd, Bennett, Jackson, Shannon, Fall River, Custer, Pennington, and Lawrence.

The initial contract period will be for one year and the government may, at its option, extend the contract to a maximum of five years by exercising each of the four one year renewal options.  Work under each of the contracts will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders.  There is no guaranteed minimum for the base year or option years, if exercised.  Task Orders will be negotiated as firm fixed-price procurements for individual or clusters of projects.

I.	OBJECTIVE

	The objective of this contract is to retain legal boundary surveying service for 	acquisitions of wetland and/or grassland easements areas including the route of ingress and egress on behalf of the United States of America, acting by and through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), United States 	Department of Agriculture, pursuant to Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 3837.

II.	BACKGROUND

	The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), Emergency Watershed Protection Program/Floodplain (EWP/FP), the Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP), and the 	Farm and Ranchland Protection Program (FRPP) authorizes the acquisition of easement rights from willing landowners for the purpose of restoring and protecting wetlands, grasslands and ranchlands.  The NRCS is the lead agency 	within the United States Department of Agriculture charged with administering these programs.

III.		SCOPE

The Contractor shall provide legal boundary surveys of the WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP easement area including the route of ingress and egress according to the following guidelines. 

Before fieldwork begins, a pre-survey site visit will occur.  Attending will be the surveyor, the NRCS District Conservationist (or other NRCS official) and the landowner (representative).  The surveyor will contact the local NRCS District Conservationist prior to the pre-survey site visit.  During the pre-survey site visit, the proposed easement boundaries will be reviewed as will the easement access route (if the easement area isn’t adjacent to a public road).  

The NRCS WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP Program Manager or District Conservationist will provide the Contractor with location maps of the WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP easement area and access route and such other descriptive information as may be available. Only the NRCS Contracting Officer may authorize a modification to 	the easement area.  Any variations in the number of acres surveyed should be reported to the Contracting Officer immediately.  The surveyor will not modify the easement area surveyed at the direction of the landowner.  Any questions regarding the easement area should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Sue Jones, at (605) 352-1213 or via fax at (605) 352-1270.

Access shall be surveyed, but no monumentation is required.  The survey will show both the easement and the ingress and egress route to a publicly dedicated right-of-way.

The Surveyor shall prepare an appropriately scaled drawing of the survey.  The survey drawing should include at a minimum, the following items:

a)	The record description of the property or the reference to the source of the record description on the property of which the easement is located on.  The survey description of the easement.
b)	North Arrow
c)	Scale
d)	Bearings, azimuth or angles, and the distances for all courses.
e)	The central angle, length of curve and radius, and the length and bearing of chord from the beginning to end of curve for each curved common boundary line or individual boundary line.
f)	Basis of bearings or azimuth.
g)	Monuments identified as set or found along with a description of the monument.
h)	Area of the surveyed easement.
i)	Observed evidence of possession or use by others in the parcel or across any perimeter lines of the property.
j)	Sufficient data to indicate the theory of location applied in formulating the opinions as to the probable location of the boundaries and corners of the property.
k)	Name, registration number, address and phone number of the Surveyor.
l)	Name of the client.
m)	Date of the survey.
n)	Certification
o)	The surveyor will also include the WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP contract number in the legend of the survey plat.

Natural or manmade barriers, such as ditches, streams, creeks, or rivers are occasionally used as boundary lines in property descriptions.  In those instances, in property descriptions where boundary lines are called for as being located at or along the centerline of a ditch, stream, creek, or river, for purposes of defining the WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP easement, the surveyor shall traverse along the top of bank of such ditch, stream, creek, or river.  In those cases where property descriptions call for boundary lines to be located at or along a lake, for the purposes of defining the WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP easement, the surveyor shall traverse along the top bank of such lake or in the absence of a top bank, the surveyor shall traverse along a mark left by wave action at the preceding high water elevation, as determined by simple observation, or at the high water mark established by the State Water Management Board to establish the easement boundary line.  In cases, where the surveyor is unable to determine the easement boundary line, the local NRCS District Conservationist will be contacted immediately to make this determination.  Questions regarding these traverses shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

In some instances, corner points for the easement survey may be submerged.  In this event, a mark left on the bank by wave action at the preceding high water, as determined by simple observation, shall be surveyed and the location for easement corners shall be mathematically offset from that line.  Witness monuments shall be located on dry ground and tied to the computed points.

Any suspected encroachment on the tract shall be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer.

Monuments and boundary marker posts signs shall be provided and installed by the surveyor at the time the survey is completed and prior to delivery of the plat of survey and legal description.  The Surveyor will need to contact the NRCS Contracting Officer to determine if a supply of marker posts is available from the NRCS stock.  If none are available, the Surveyor shall provide such marker posts.  The Surveyor will be required to pick up the signs at the local NRCS office.  Monuments and marker posts with sign shall be installed at each corner, angle point, road crossing, and approximately  every 300 feet along the easement boundary lines.  Marker posts and monuments are required at the intersection of property lines and rivers, lakes, or streams.  All monuments must be thoroughly described and specifically identified as set or found, whenever shown on maps or referred to in documents prepared by the Surveyor.  Descriptions of monuments must be sufficient in detail to readily facilitate future recovery by other surveyors and to enable positive identification.  Acceptable monument types are:

1.	Steel rebar:  ½ inch diameter or larger with properly stamped survey cap.
2.	Steel pipe:  ½ inch inside diameter or larger with properly stamped survey cap.
3.	Concrete markers:  minimum of 4 inch diameter or 4 inches square buried in the ground, with a rebar or metal pipe and properly stamped cap encased in the concrete.

Minimum length for all monuments is two feet.  All monuments will be set flush with or below the ground surface and marked with a marker post and sign.   Acceptable marker posts are:

1.	“T” shaped steel fence post 1 3/8” x 1 3/8” x 1/8” or heavier.  Minimum length shall be seventy-eight inches.  The top six inches (6”) of the marker post shall be fluroscent orange.  

2.	“U” shaped metal sign post, minimum length shall be seventy-eight inches long, 1.12 lbs per foot.  The top six inches (6”) shall be fluorescent orange.

Marker posts shall be installed to project 4.5 feet above the ground surface.  The surveyor is required to attach a WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP boundary sign (3” x 4 ½”) to the top of the marker post using a galvanized nut and bolt or lag screw.  A wire attachment is not acceptable.  The WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP sign has two 3/8 inch drilled holes.    

The surveyor will need to provide to the Contracting Officer:

1.	One mylar and one copy (36” X 24”) signed and sealed original survey plats that meet the requirements for filing in the appropriate county land records.
2.	One copy (11” x 17”) survey plat to the Contracting Officer and one copy 	(11” x 17”) of the survey plat to the local NRCS District Conservationist.
3.	A printout of the original field notes.    

The survey and descriptions shall meet all requirements of South Dakota Codified Laws and be certified by a Registered Professional Land Surveyor licensed in the State of South Dakota.  The relative position tolerance and traverse closure shall 	be twenty six hundredths of a foot (0.26) plus 200 parts per million (ppm) at the 95 percent (95%) confidence level as defined by the National Society of Professional Surveyors for Rural Surveys.  The survey plat will identify 	monuments and list the project coordinates in the UTM 13 or 14 Coordinate System  The Contractor is not to provide a copy of the survey plat to the landowner.  

The survey plat shall be certified by the registered land surveyor, who shall attach an official seal thereto as specified in §36-18A-45 of the South Dakota Codified Laws as being in all respects correct.  The landowner, or the landowner’s duly authorized agent, shall certify that the survey plat has been made at the request and under the direction of the landowner for the purposes indicated therein, that he or she is the owner of all the land included therein, and that development of 	this land shall conform to all existing applicable zoning, subdivision and erosion and sediment control regulations.  The landowner certification shall be acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the acknowledgment of deeds 	and, with the certificate of such acknowledgement, shall be endorsed on or attached to the plat and be recorded as a part thereof in the office of register of deeds of the proper county.

The following shall be included in the legal description of the property:

a)	A clear statement of the relationship between the described property and the survey control or the basis of the unique location.
b)	The basis of bearings when bearings are used.
c)	Metes and bounds descriptions shall include bearings or angles and distances in order to allow for the computation of a mathematical closure.
d)	Citations to the recording information or other identifying documentation for any maps, plats or other documents referenced.
e)	Detailed description of any natural or artificial monument referenced.

The following statement will be included on each survey:

	THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT THIS SURVEY WAS DONE BY THE 	UNDERSIGNED, THAT THE SURVEY WAS DONE ON THE GROUND IN 	ACCORDANCE WITH THE MOST RECENT MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR 	PROPERTY BOUNDARY SURVEYS, AS SET FORTH BY THE STATE OF 	SOUTH DAKOTA, BOARD OF REGISTRATION FOR PROFESSIONAL 	ENGINEERS AND LAND SURVEYORS, AND THAT THE ACCURACY 	SPECIFICATION AND POSITION TOLERANCE ARE IN ACCORDANCE 	WITH RURAL AREA SURVEYS.

<SUBJECT>B -- Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Battlelab Broad Agency Announcement #2
<SOLNBR>BAA-UAVB-05-002
<RESPDATE>070906
<ARCHDATE>07242006
<CONTACT>David Huber, Contracting Officer, Phone 702-652-3366, Fax 702-652-3367, Email david.huber@nellis.af.mil - David Huber, Contracting Officer, Phone 702-652-3366, Fax 702-652-3367, Email david.huber@nellis.af.mil
<DESC>A.         THIS IS A BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA-UAVB-05-002) FOR UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE SENSE AND AVOID CAPABILITY.

B.         INTRODUCTION 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regulation 7610.4 states remotely operated aircraft (aka UAVs) must have
“…equivalent level of safety, comparable to see-and-avoid requirements for manned aircraft” in order to operate like manned aircraft in the National Air Space (NAS).  The capability must be effective against all air traffic, with or without active, transponder-based collision avoidance systems.  The capability must interact with -- but not replace -- other safety of flight mechanisms used by manned aircraft.  Currently, no onboard “sense and avoid” capability
exists.  UAVs operating in the NAS must obtain Certificates of Authorization, a cumbersome process, and/or use either chase planes or ground-based observers.  The Operational Requirements Documents (ORDs) for both RQ-4 (Global Hawk) and MQ-1 (Predator) require operation in the NAS.  The UAV Battlelab is interested in any systems that would be able to perform the “sense and avoid” function while adhering to the size, weight and power constraints of a Predator-class aircraft.   The system must have at least an area of coverage 110 degrees right and left of centerline and plus or minus 15 degrees of flight line.

The UAV Battlelab invites concept papers with preliminary cost estimates to satisfy the requirements for the “sense and avoid” function described above.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369 “The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.”  Concept papers in response to this announcement shall be submitted to 99 CONS/LGCC, marked for BAA-UAVB-05-002, 5865 Swaab Blvd., Bldg. 588, Nellis AFB NV 89191-7063.  Electronic submission of concept papers may be made to david.huber@nellis.af.mil by attaching the document to e-mail.  Responses should reference the above BAA number and provide contact information (name, phone number, e-mail address, etc.).  This announcement is effective and open until 9 JUL 06.  Concept papers in response to this announcement may be submitted at any time during this period.  There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic and interested parties should be on the alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.


C.         OBJECTIVE

(1) Technical Description: 

The proposed concept will be based on the demonstration of a MATURE TECHNOLOGY.

All responses to this BAA will be evaluated for applicability to the aforementioned need.         


D.         ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Potential offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference number BAA-UAVB-05-002 with their submissions.  Potential offerors are required to register their company information at www.ccr.gov before any contracts can be awarded to that company.     Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply. 

E.         CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS 

Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the concept paper and any evaluations.     The submitter must mark the concept paper with a protective legend IAW FAR 3.104-5.    Offerors are strongly encouraged to submit concept papers, not to exceed five (5) pages, to the electronic addresses listed in section A of this announcement.     However, if you do not have the capability of transmitting the concept paper electronically, submit three (3) copies, not to exceed 5 pages, of the proposed concept to Captain David Huber at the address in Section A of this BAA.  The concept paper shall be formatted as follows: 

Section A: Title, Submitter, Date, E-Mail Account, Phone#, Fax #, Organization/Office Symbol, Address; Period of Performance, Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost of effort. 

Section B: Proposed Solution summarizing the system and how it will enhance UAV operations.

Section C:  Support components required for demonstration to include hardware, software, data, facilities, and training.

Section D: Identify similar contracts to include the point of contacts current telephone # and address.     For papers marked proprietary, the offeror shall submit a non-proprietary title and summary, not to exceed one (1) additional page.

Those solutions found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a complete technical and price proposal.     AN INVITATION BASED UPON A SUBMITTED CONCEPT PAPER DOES NOT ASSURE THAT THE OFFEROR WILL BE AWARDED A SUBSEQUENT CONTRACT. 

F.         BASIS FOR AWARD

(1) Concept papers will be evaluated as they are received based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other concepts submitted under this announcement.  Concept papers will be evaluated under the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: 

(a) Technical merit of the proposed concept.

(b) Proposed cost.     

(c) Maturity of technology.

All three areas, (a) through (c), will be evaluated at the same time during the evaluation process.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the concept papers.

(2) Anticipated Period of Performance: Average duration of demonstrations will be up to 15 months from time of award through complete evaluation and demonstration of the operational concept.  However, some initiatives may require more resources depending on complexity of the concept.  Type of contract(s) expected: Firm-Fixed Price (Unless another contract type is determined by the contracting officer to be more appropriate).  Primary appropriation type: Operations and Maintenance.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) ) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Stratus Consulting  to conduct an economic analysis to measure benefits of right whale protection in the Northwest Atlantic. The purpose of this contract is to attain the services of a contractor with expertise in non-market valuation methods (contingent valuation, contingent choice methods or experimental economics) to develop a long-term study/strategic plan that includes an economic measure of willingness-to-pay (WTP) for right whale protection.  The proposed contract is a continuation of a three phase study effort wherein the first year was awarded to Stratus Consulting and Year 2 completes Phase 1 (Pre-design) of the three phase study effort that consists of research along with the development of a comprehensive research plan and a survey instrument that can be implemented in Phase 2 (Survey implementation).  This pre-design step also includes assistance in designing a non-market valuation study that would allow NMFS to use the derived WTP estimates in some benefit-cost type of analysis.  Phase 2 (option period) consists of implementation of the final survey instrument and production of a final, clean dataset ready for analysis.  Phase 3 (option period) will consist of the analysis of the final survey dataset and the completion of a final project report. After the pre-design phase is complete, feasibility of the study assessed, and the scope of the long-term project is developed, NMFS will determine whether additional research will be implemented.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990.  The small business size standard is $6.0M.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to complete the development of a national survey instrument while maintaining the integrity of the research developed to date by Stratus Consulting by June 16, 2005.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE:
HSCG40-05-Q-40771

This acquisition is subject to Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The Solicitation, Evaluation, and Award procedures of FAR Parts13.106-1, 13.106-2, and 13.106-3 apply.  

The Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center intends to procure ONE Crankshaft (used on the Paxman 16RP200M Engine).  NSN:  2815-99-810-6101.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with contractors who can provide CERTIFIED AUTHENTIC OEM Parts.

This will be other than full and open competition using OEM Man B&W. Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to Man B&W parts are not available to the Government and are propriety to the OEM.  Accordingly, it is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center from obtaining competition, as they are available from one source.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The procurement involves parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacturer or its actual supplier.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities as follows:  (i.e. salient physical functional and serviceability characteristics) (1) show that they satisfactorily manufactured the parts for the Government or the prime equipment manufacturer; or (2) submit complete and current engineering data comparing the offered parts to the OEM to demonstrate the acceptability of the parts.  The submission of technical data packages for review shall not impede the award.  It is the Government’s belief that only Man B&W., the manufacturer of the crankshafts and/or its authorized dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure the proper fit, form and function of all its components.  The US Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center does not possess the technical expertise to evaluate the parts of an alternate product.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing capabilities in duplicate within fifteen (15) days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing information is required.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for this information solicited.  Responses must be concise and be specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above.  Concerns that respond to the notice must fully demonstrate their capabilities to meet the requirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capabilities should be sent to the attention of Shelli Stanley, Contract Specialist (CODE 044).    See number notes 22 and 26.

A solicitation will be released on or about June 16th, 2005.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  HSARPA is the external funding arm for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate.  HSARPA performs these functions, in part, by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories and academic institutions.

The goal of the HSARPA Low Vapor Pressure Chemicals Detection Systems (LVPCDS) Program is to develop, field-test, and transition to commercialization existing, state-of-the-art and next generation systems that can detect toxic compounds having low vapor pressures (&#8804; 10-4 Torr) without coming in contact with the contaminated surface.  The DHS S&T Directorate has identified two high priority requirements as Technical Topic Areas (TTAs) to be addressed in this solicitation (These TTAs are described in greater detail in Section 4, “LVPCDS Program Goals”).
 The LVPCDS Program will facilitate a number of DHS goals, including:
&#61607;	Enabling novel and cost effective enhancements to existing detection systems for rapid deployment;
&#61607;	Development of next generation detection systems providing superior performance, ease of operation, and cost; and
&#61607;	Development of revolutionary technologies, subsystems or components with significant impact on cost and/or performance of existing or next generation detection systems.

FAR Clauses:  52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitatio! n will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you g! ather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-1 Buy American Act-Supplies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.o.B.

<DESC>National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory, Health Branch intend to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mid-Atlantic Research Institute, LLC (MARI) to conduct work in the 'Development of Facilities and Methodology for Conducting Diesel Emissions Testing at the NIOSH Lake Lynn Laboratory'.  MARI has extensive experience in testing diesel engines in the laboratory and in real world environment, they possess equipment and experience to take in-mine tailpipe emission measurements and are in close proximity to the facility to accomplish the frequent visits required by the statement of work.

BACKGROUND

The NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) is currently working on four projects related to worker exposures to diesel particulate matter and gases.  These are: (1) Selection and Evaluation of Diesel Emission Controls for Outby Underground Coal Mine Equipment (927P135), (2) Reducing Underground Miner’s Exposure to Diesel Emissions (927007F), (3) Ultrafine aerosols from diesel-powered equipment (927008S), and (4) Characterizing Diesel Emissions in Underground Mines (927003B). Evaluation of control technologies that are available to the underground mining industry, methods designed to control diesel particulate emissions, characterizing diesel particulate matter (DPM) in mine air with respect to size distribution, and size-resolved chemical composition of DPM are major research objectives of the NIOSH diesel projects.

NIOSH PRL researchers are currently designing and constructing a diesel emissions facility at the NIOSH Lake Lynn Laboratory (LLL), Fairchance, Pennsylvania. The objective is to integrate the NIOSH Mobile Engine Emissions Laboratory (MEEL) into the D drift of LLL, establish a facility that will offer a unique environment for field-testing of diesel technologies, and have accuracies characteristic of emissions laboratories. This is important to avoid any laboratory uncertainties introduced with various process simulations and to bridge the gap between inherently inaccurate real world field experiments and unrealistic laboratory investigations. The goal is to create a research facility that will allow characterizing diesel emissions in occupational settings. 

LLL is a limestone mine situated about 97 km (60 miles) southeast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and 16 km (10 miles) northeast of Morgantown, West Virginia. The D drift is 530 meters (1750 ft) long. The drift is approximately 6 meters (20 feet) wide and 2 meters (7 feet) high. Fresh ventilation air is supplied from the ventilation shaft located in E drift, situated immediately upwind and normal to D drift. Air quantity is regulated with a sliding door positioned at the upstream end of D drift. For diesel emission studies, the D drift can be treated as a full-flow dilution tunnel.

NIOSH Mobile Engine Emissions Laboratory (MEEL) is built around two eddy-current dynamometers, SAJ Model AE150 (150 kW) and AE 400 (400kW). The smaller dynamometer is mounted on a base plate supplied by Application Engineering, South Haven, Michigan. The dynamometer is currently coupled to a naturally aspirated mechanically controlled Isuzu C240 diesel engine. The larger dynamometer has been recently acquired and will be mounted on a base plate supplied by Application Engineering and coupled to Mercedes Benz OM904 modern electronically controlled turbocharged engine. The dynamometers are suitable for loading the test engines over various steady-state and transient cycles. A Model Dyn-Loc IV dynamometer and Model DTC-1 engine throttle controller from Dynesystems Co. Germantown, WI provide engine control. The smaller MEEL is mounted on a custom built trailer that allows movement to various locations. 

Ambient emissions, generated by various configurations of diesel engines, exhaust aftertreatment devices, and fuel formulations, will be measured for particulate matter and selected gaseous concentrations in the mine air downstream of the dynamometer and engine. The same pollutants will be also measured simultaneously in the exhaust system of each tested engine. The results of the ambient concentration and tailpipe emissions measurements will be analyzed and used to assess effects of control technologies, validate the methods, and obtain test parameters such as a dilution rate.

NIOSH is currently working on integrating the MEEL into LLL facilities and developing test protocols and procedures for conducting diesel research there.  NIOSH needs to design and develop two sampling stations.  The first station, an ambient monitoring station, will monitor and record concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and total hydrocarbons (HC) in the D drift ambient air downstream of the MEEL.  The second station, a tailpipe monitoring station, will monitor and record concentrations of CO, CO2, NO, NO2, and O2 in the raw exhaust of the test engines. The following instrumentation will be used for measurement of ambient concentrations of selected gases:

1.	Eco Physics Chemiluminescence NO/NO2 analyzer Model CLD 700 AL (Range: 0.1/1/10/100 NOx)
2.	California Analytical Instruments Heated Flame Ionization Detector Model 300 HFID (Range: 0-10/30/100/300/1000/3000/10000/30000 ppm)
3.	INNOVA 1312 Photoacoustic Multi-gas Monitor with filters for CO, CO2, SO2, non-Methane hydrocarbons, and water vapor.

A Perma Pure “Mini-GASS” Gas Analysis Sampling System Model MG-1220 will be used for conditioning samples prior to measurement. The data stream from the analog outputs of the selected instruments will be acquired using an Agilent Technologies 34970A Data Acquisition System.

Three Industrial Scientific iTX multigas monitors will measure ambient concentrations of CO, NO, and NO2. Three infrared CO2 monitors from RKI Instruments Inc. are also available for ambient monitoring of CO2 concentrations.

A California Analytical Model 602 Series non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) analyzer will measure CO and CO2 concentrations in the exhaust of tested engines. The data from the analog outputs of this instrument will be collected using the Logic Beach “ModuLogger” data acquisition system. The ECOM KL Portable Emissions Analyzer with O2, CO, CO2, NO, and NO2 is also available for measurement of those gases in the exhaust of test engines.

The Horiba Instruments (STEC Inc.) automated gas divider SGD-A10 will be used to calibrate gas-detection instruments. The gases needed for calibration of the aforementioned instruments will be acquired by NIOSH. The Perma Pure Zero-Air generator (18 liter) will be used to supply zero air for dilution of the calibration gases and purge both instrumentation and the sampling system. 

Accessories needed for this project, including pumps, tubing, filters etc. are available or will be acquired by NIOSH. The instrumentation will be protected using air conditioned enclosures supplied by NIOSH.
SPECIFIC TASKS

NIOSH researchers have recognized the need for expert assistance in accomplishing the following tasks:

(1)	Integration of NIOSH-supplied instrumentation into ambient sampling stations for continuous measurement and recording of CO, CO2, NO, NO2, SO2, and total hydrocarbons in mine air downstream of the MEEL in the D-drift of LLL
(2)	Integration of NIOSH-supplied instrumentation into tailpipe sampling stations for continuous measurement and recording of CO, NO, NO2, O2 concentrations in the tailpipe of test engines
(3)	Development of detailed protocols for the measurement of CO, CO2, NO, NO2, SO2, and total hydrocarbon concentrations in the mine air as a part of diesel studies at LLL, including selection of sampling station locations 
(4)	Development of detailed protocols for measurement of CO, NO, NO2, and O2 concentrations in the tailpipes of test engines as a part of diesel studies at LLL
(5)	Development of detailed protocols for calibration of the aforementioned gas-detection instrumentation for diesel studies at LLL
(6)	Development of a methodology for establishing a dilution factor (ratio between concentrations of pollutants in an engine exhaust and in diluted exhaust) achieved in D-drift in quasi-real time using simultaneous measurements of one or more aforementioned gases.

A contractor will validate the product and the protocols through a series of tests conducted in the LLL D drift. The contractor will supply NIOSH with a detailed report on the findings and detailed documentation for the resulting designs and protocols.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for Human Space Flight Mission Services that includes providing mission operations and planning ground systems in support of space flight programs. The Mission Control Center (MCC), Integrated Planning System (IPS), and the Houston Support Room/Backup Command and Control Center in Russia, are currently used to accomplish this function. In addition, ground system services for JSC’s Emergency Operations Center along with Space Communications Integration are provided.  NASA/JSC intends to purchase these services from Lockheed Martin Space Operations Company (LMSOC) through an extension of the Mission Support Operations Contract (MSOC), NAS9-03056.  The period of performance for the MSOC extension is October 1, 2006, through September 30, 2008, plus three 1-year options for services through September 30, 2011.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as contemplated by the provisions of FAR 6.302-1.  This provision states that full and open competition need not be provided for when the services required by the agency are available from only the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services. The provision also states that this exception is applicable when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency’s requirements.  The original Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) for the current NAS 9-03056, MSOC, currently held by Lockheed Martin Space Operations Company was approved by the NASA Administrator on June 3, 2003, and issued pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Due to the fact that LMSOC was the original developer of the systems in the MCC and IPS and now operates these facilities, they are uniquely qualified to provide support for critical International Space Station (ISS) Assembly Complete services.	This unique support is also required during Space Shuttle operations activities supporting ISS assembly operations.  It is recognized Space Shuttle operation and ISS Assembly activities are extremely critical activities for NASA.	Any other source besides LMSOC would require an extensive learning period before full operations could be assumed, which is not acceptable to the Government during the critical Space Shuttle operations and ISS Assembly Complete service periods.  The consistency provided by the developer of the software for these functions can only be provided by LMSOC.  This consistency is required by the Government for these functions, and the safety risk to the Government associated with transitioning a new contractor can not be accepted at this time due to the criticality of these functions.   NASA plans to use the Space Shuttle to complete the assembly of the ISS.  The ISS assembly schedule is tightly constrained with the Space Shuttle retirement in 2010, or earlier.  The schedule margin that would be required for a competitive selection and potentially incorporating a new space operations contractor into the program would not support the ISS assembly schedule.  Competition of the Space Shuttle and ISS space operations requirements could also lead to the loss of knowledgeable personnel introducing risk to both the Space Shuttle and ISS programs.    Because of these considerations, including the unacceptable costs and delays that would be incurred to conduct a competition and/or select a different contractor, the potential benefits from competition do not justify accepting these substantial risks to the Space Shuttle and ISS programs.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) Human System Research and Technology division (HSRT) is soliciting innovative concepts, ideas, technologies and research approaches for its Human-Systems Integration (HSI) research and technology program.  The Human-Systems Integration program goal is to produce safe, efficient and effective flight crew systems and supporting ground operations. Human-centered design and operations and effective training will increase system maintainability, boost the efficiency of ground and flight crews, reduce human error, simplify human interaction and augment human productivity to improve safety and ensure mission success.   The HSI program is driven by requirements, standards and other guiding documents including:  the Bioastronautics Roadmap (www.bioastroroadmap.nasa.gov), the Human Ratings Requirements and Standards: NPR 8705.2 (www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codeq/doctree/87052.htm), Human Systems Integration Standards: NASA Standard 3000 (    http://msis.jsc.nasa.gov/	  ), emerging Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) program requirements, and other medical and operational requirements.  The HSI program seeks inputs into any or all of the 10 related technical research areas listed in the attached document. We are particularly interested in innovative ideas and approaches that will change the face of human space exploration and enable NASA scientists, technologists and engineers to make timely and effective decisions for ESMD acquisition.  These development efforts reach from the Crew Exploration Vehicle in Low Earth Orbit, through lunar surface exploration, to Mars and beyond.  Specific ideas can range from Technology Readiness Levels 2 (technology concept and/or application formulated) to TRL 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant ground or space environment). Fundamental science and technology challenges must be framed in a context that is traceable to the ESMD acquisition strategy.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, with Ani Lytics, Inc for the analysis of clinical tests from on-going clinical trials. This Notice Of Intent is being issued as NOI5077. The statutory authority for this acquisition is FAR 13.501 and award is anticipated to be made under a Firm Fixed Price purchase order. The acquisition documents and incorporated provisions and classes are those in Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03. This acquisition will be processed under the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541380 and the business size standard is $6 million. The period of performance of this contract will be from July 01, 2005 through June 30, 2006. NIAID studies the etiology, pathogenesis and prevention of viral hepatitis and other diseases. Current research efforts include elucidation of the molecular virology of hepatitis A and the development of a live-attenuated hepatitis A vaccine, delineation of the genetic heterogeneity of hepatitis C virus and characterization of the immune response to it, the diagnosis and prevention of hepatitis E, and the molecular and biological characterization of newly discovered hepatitis C-like viruses of humans and primates. These activities require the inoculation of animals, principally nonhuman primates, with clinical materials and the study of the resulting response of the animals. This requires testing animals for physiological, immunological and biochemical changes over time. A critical part of this analysis is testing serum liver enzyme levels, bilirubin levels, other clinical chemistry values and hematologic changes. The tests to be performed are Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (ICD), Amino Aline Transferase (ALT) and Gamma Glutamine Tranferase. These tests are non-routine analyses established exclusively at Ani Lytics, Inc. expressly for this study. Since Ani Lytics has extensively performed this test for NIAID in the past they must continue to provide the testing in order to compare data analyses and maintain consistency in the results.  FAR 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements because the NIAID has used this company for extensive testing for many years and it is very important that the data obtained in the future can be compared with data obtained in the past.  This can be assured only by continuing to employ Ani Lytics, Inc. for the testing, since each testing facility has its own methods for performing tests, its own standards and its own quality control, and these vary, sometimes markedly, among the different facilities. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This is not a request for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material insufficient detail to allow NIAID to determine if the party can perform this requirement. The FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition:  52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212.3 Offeror Representations and Certifications; FAR 52.212-4 Contractor Terms and Conditions Commercial Items;  FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items.  Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items.  Capability statements must be received by mail by 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Saving Time June 20, 2005.   In order to be considered for an award, an offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications located at http://orca.bpn.gov/ in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a). By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledge the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR at www.ccr.gov prior to award during performance and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement resulting from solicitation [Note: Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration will make an offeror ineligible for award].  For delivery through the postal service the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 10401 Fernwood Drive, Suite 2NE62E, Room 2NE62C, MSC/4811, Bethesda, Maryland 20817-4811.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Juareatha Greer Purchasing Agent, at jgreer@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-480-3695. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NOI-5077.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute intends to negotiate with the University of California at Los Angeles for a five year continuation of Contract number: N01-CN-25404 for the receipt, processing,  and storage of PLCO biospecimens.  The project includes the continutation of laboratory analysis of PSA and CA-125 Blood specimens and the subsequent tracking and storage of those blood samples.  In addition, UCLA shall receive tumor tissue block specimens from PLCO participants who have developed cancer, and shall process these tissue blocks into tissue arrays, extract tumor DNA, and tumor RNA.  UCLA shall track and store these arrays, DNA extractions, and RNA extractions in a manner such that they may be retrieved and linked to other PLCO biospecimens from the same participant already being stored for research purposes.  The contractor currently processes and stores other PLCO specimens which are linked to the PLCO biorepository: a necessity for longitudinal studies on the causes, treatment, and prognosis of cancer.  It is necessary that the pathology specimens to be acquired in this contract be monitored and tracted by the same system so that the pathology specimens can be linked to the biorepository and ACF specimens for retrieval of specimens from the same patinet for research purposes.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this final phase of the study, which provides for longer follow-up and data analysis.

Note: 22: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one sources under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No Collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland requires a Contractor to develop a computational model that provides quantitative understanding of fire growth and burning rates of real thermoplastic objects that melt and flow, and to deliver the model code and training in its use to NIST staff.

History of the activities surrounding this specific requirement:

The Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is dedicated to improving the performance and safety of constructed facilities.  The purpose of the Reduced Risk of Fire Spread Program is to develop effective strategies for cost-effectively reducing the Nation’s fire losses (both human and financial) by limiting fire growth and spread in and to residences. 

Why the Government has a need for this requirement:

Many computational techniques have been developed to model free surface behavior of fluids, including Volume of Fluid (VOF), level-set, particle-in-cell (PIC), Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE), Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM), Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM), and many others.  Previous attempts to model the physics and chemistry of melt flow of thermoplastic objects using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method have resulted in unreasonable runtimes even for two-dimensional problems.  Newer techniques may give accurate results with shorter runtimes.

Procurement Method:

This will be an unrestricted, full and open competitive procurement to be conducted under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, since NIST has determined that a small business set-aside is not appropriate based on its market research and has received approval from the U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business (OSDBU) to conduct this procurement on an unrestricted, full and open competition basis based on NIST’s market research.

North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541690 will apply to the procurement, with a small business size standard of $6.0 million.

The Government contemplates award of a single Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) completion type contract consisting of a base period of one year and one one-year option period for services specified in the performance work statement that will be included in the RFP.

A Request for Proposals (RFP) is anticipated to be posted on www.fedbizopps.gov on or about June 30, 2005.  The solicitation, solicitation amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will only be made available via www.fedbizopps.gov.   Potential offerors are encouraged to monitor www.fedbizopps.gov periodically to determine when the RFP has been posted.

There is no incumbent Contractor for this acquisition.

Interested parties must submit a proposal in response to Section L of the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.

No bidders list is being maintained for this procurement.

Instructions for how to submit questions relating to this acquisition will be included in Section L of the RFP when it is posted to www.fedbizopps.gov.  No telephone questions/inquiries will be entertained.

Proposals will be due no later than thirty (30) days after RFP release unless the RFP is amended to extend the due date for proposals.

All responsible sources may submit an offer in response to the RFP after it is posted.

The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>MR ROKM PART 2 - Multi Role Responsive Ordnance Kill Mechanism (MR ROKM) Program

Special Amendment to MNK-BAA-04-0001 Continuation

B--ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

(1) Type of Contract: The Government anticipates negotiating approximately two Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts for this effort.  Task Order 0001 will be issued along with each contract awarded, for Phase 1 (the first 11 months) of the program.  At the end of Phase 1, a down-select to a single contractor will occur, and program Phase 2 will be awarded under Task Order 0002 to the selected contractor.  A third Task Order for Phase 3 is anticipated upon completion of Phase 2/Task 0002.  It is currently expected that the MR ROKM Program will consist primarily of Task Orders 0001, 0002, and 0003.  However, an IDIQ contract will allow for additional in-scope tasks to be awarded later to accommodate spiral developments and additional funding should it become available.  Accordingly, it is anticipated the IDIQ contract will bear a ceiling maximum of approximately $14M.

(2) Expected Award Date:  Late September 2005.

(3) Anticipated Period of Performance:  The IDIQ MR ROKM program contract ordering period will be 5 years.  The current MR ROKM program is anticipated to take 48 months, with Task 0001/Phase 1, taking approximately 11 months, Task 0002/Phase 2 taking 2 years, and Task 0003/Phase 3 taking 1 year.  The 5-year ordering period will allow for the addition of in-scope tasks and spiral developments should additional funding become available.

(4) Government Funding: The Government is currently considering the following funding profile for this effort:  $10K in FY05 funds per contractor; $1,130K in FY06 funds per contractor; $2,280K in FY07 funds for a single contractor; $3,162K in FY08 funds for a single contractor; and $1,013K in FY09 funds for a single contractor for the remainder of the MR ROKM program.  This is an estimate only--not a promise of funding.  It is desired that contract expenditures be managed and billed so as to maximize FY05, FY06, FY07, FY08, and FY09 expenditures.

(5) Government Furnished Information (GFI):  The Government may assist in providing GFI, based on availability, if requested.  Therefore, the offeror shall include a detailed list of Government resources (material formulation instructions, lethality assessment software, target models, etc.), and their associated approximate costs, required to execute a contract in a timely and cost effective manner.  

(6) NAICS Size Status.  NAICS code for this acquisition is 541710; small business size standard is 1000 employees.  The acquisition is unrestricted (considered full and open competition).  Thus, all qualifying responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered (but see next paragraph).

(7) Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms:  A determination has been made for this solicitation, that all foreign participation at the prime contractor and subcontractor level will be prohibited.  

(8) Cost-Sharing Proposals: The Government does not require a cost sharing arrangement.  If one is proposed, the Government may or may not consider such an arrangement for award.  

(9) Down-Selections:  Selections for subsequent tasks will be based on the contractor’s ability to achieve and exceed the technical program requirements/goals of Phase I, as defined below.  Additionally, a refined proposal will be required at the end of Phase I, which will be evaluated against the Evaluation Criteria Factors in Section D--Basis for Award.

 (10)  Scheduling and program planning.  The entire MR ROKM Program consists of multiple “Phases”.  It is currently envisioned that the plan for MR ROKM is as follows:

Phase 1 (September 2005 – August 2006):  Dual award.  Design, fabricate, and perform a static arena test of the MR ROKM kill mechanism, explosively launching projectiles vs. target panels (to simulate the MR ROKM air and ground target set) at range.  Establish the Phase 1 design as the baseline design.  Compare to Models & Simulations (M&S).  Develop & deliver the remaining program test plan.

Phase 2 (September 2006 – August 2008):  Down select to a single contractor.  Design, fabricate and perform static arena testing of the MR ROKM kill mechanism vs. representative MR ROKM air & ground target materials.  Conduct sufficient design spirals, introducing materials and technologies as appropriate.  Demonstrate and model desired fragment effectiveness for air & ground targets.  Refine the modeling & simulation to include new designs and technologies. 

Phase 3 (September 2008 – August 2009): Perform a final kill mechanism design iteration and demonstrate via static arena testing.  Conduct dynamic demonstration testing of the final MR ROKM design vs. an air and ground target (within set) or their representation.  Update & finalize the validation of kill mechanism effects models.


C—WHITE PAPER AND PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: 

(1) White Papers:  White Papers should address all areas indicated by the Evaluation Factors, including how the contractor intends to achieve the requirements and goals outlined in section A--REQUIREMENTS of this Amendment for the entire program.  Experience and past performance should be addressed.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate should be provided for each Phase.  Additionally the White Papers shall include any partners, subcontractors, etc., to be utilized, discuss risk (schedule and otherwise) assessment and technology maturity level required to meet requirements and goals, and point out the modeling and simulation (M&S) software that will be used in ordnance package design and effectiveness assessments. 

(2) General:  All offerors should apply the restrictive notice prescribed in the provision at FAR 52.215-1 (e), Restriction on Disclosure and Use of Data, to trade secrets or privileged commercial and financial information contained in their proposals.  For formal proposals, submit separate Technical and Cost Volumes, and mark them as valid for 180 days.  Volume 1 should provide the Technical proposal addressing the objective and requirements, and should be unclassified, if possible.  Any classified material must be provided in a separate Annex and must be properly marked and handled as such.  Volume 2, Cost Proposal, must be unclassified, and should address the price, cost details, and a risk assessment of the proposal.  Questions should be directed to the appropriate points of contact listed in Section E.  Offerors may consider instructions contained in the AFRL BAA and PRDA Industry Guide, but if those instructions differ from this announcement, this announcement prevails.  The document may be viewed and downloaded at http://www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract/Ind-gde.rtf.  

(3) Technical Proposal:  In the event that the White Paper results in an invitation to submit a formal proposal, Volume 1 -Technical Proposal shall include, as a minimum, a broad Statement of Objectives (SOO) or Statement of Work (SOW) for the basic IDIQ contract, suitable for incorporation into the basic contract; and a contract schedule.  Additionally, a SOW suitable for incorporation should be provided for Task 0001/Phase 1.  Volume 1 should fully address the approach in accomplishing the Program Requirements of Section A above.  The contractor must also provide a summary of relevant past and present performance.  Relevant past and present performance is defined as performance by the proposed program manager, lead technical investigator and/or chief engineer supporting ordnance package programs within the last five years, or past efforts by other key personnel proposed by the offeror for performance of this contract.  State the capacity in which these individuals acted in these relevant programs.  Relevant past and present performance data shall be submitted to the Government no less than 10 days prior to the specified proposal submission date.  In the technical proposal, the offeror shall propose and elaborate upon a specific Program Point of Departure Design.  The offeror must provide sufficient technical discussion and technical detail to establish the soundness of the proposed approach; provide an adequate basis for assessing program technical cost and schedule risk; and form a sound basis for the cost proposed in Volume 2.  To that end, the proposal shall address all aspects of the Point of Departure Design.  The proposal shall also identify and discuss the suitability of the various modeling and analysis tools that the contractor proposes to use during the MR ROKM Program to accomplish the hardware design, and if and how existing modeling and analysis tools need to be modified.  Proposals failing to provide adequate technical detail and discussion may be considered technically unresponsive to this BAA.

<DESC>MR ROKM PART 1 - Multi Role Responsive Ordnance Kill Mechanism (MR ROKM) Program

Special Amendment to MNK-BAA-04-0001

INTRODUCTION:  The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division (AFRL/MNM) is interested in receiving White Papers for the MR ROKM Program under this Special Amendment to Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) MNK-BAA-04-0001, for Armament Technology Research.  AFRL/MN has been investigating directional warhead technologies for the past 8 years, culminating with the PIOS Phase II Program.  The PIOS II program goals were to use novel geometry and initiation schemes to maximize the lethal effects of fragments aimed toward a point on an air target, and to increase the counter air lethality at increased miss distances.  As an evolution of these technologies, AFRL/MNM now seeks the design of a kill mechanism with a dual role capability that would address a subset of stationary ground targets in addition to air targets.  This kill mechanism is intended for use in a new dual role missile system.  The focus of the MR ROKM Program is to maintain current counter air missile lethality while demonstrating effectiveness against stationary ground targets.  

White Paper submittals should reference “MNK-BAA-04-0001” and the Research Topic “Damage Mechanisms Research”.  Where the instructions in MNK-BAA-04-0001 differ from the instructions in this Special Amendment, this document prevails.  White Papers should not exceed 15 letter-size pages, with not less than 12-pitch type size, and should be submitted not later than 1:30 PM Central Time to AFRL/MNK on 05 July 05.  It is anticipated approximately two of the White Papers may be selected for further consideration, and their originators may subsequently be requested to submit formal written technical and cost proposals, with the intent of negotiating approximately two contracts for the MR ROKM Program.  Four hard copies and one electronic copy (on a CD or DVD) of the White Papers should be submitted to the AFRL/MNK Contracting office to the parties shown in Section E - item (1).  Email submissions will not be accepted.  A confirmation of receipt will be generated via email as White Papers are received, if an email address is provided with the White Paper.  All submittals received will be reviewed and evaluated using the Evaluation Criteria found within this document.  Offerors should be alert to any amendments that may be published.  The Government reserves the right to amend due dates or other data as necessary.  


A--REQUIREMENTS:  

(1) Program Objective:  The overall program objective is to design and demonstrate a multi-role kill mechanism that would defeat air targets and a subset of stationary ground targets.   

(2) Technical Requirements and Goals:  The contractor’s design shall be based on the program objective and the requirements/goals.  The contractor’s design shall, as a minimum, satisfy the technical threshold requirements and strive to meet the technical objective requirements.  The program threshold and objective requirements are listed in a Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) / Down-Select Criteria chart available to qualified contractors (those that submit certified DD Form 2345).  

(3) Request Available Pertinent Data Package:  Specific air target and ground target effectiveness requirements and other KPPs, lethality studies, target briefings, related technical reports, etc., relating to the technical requirements may be obtained by sending a certified copy of a DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, and appropriate clearance data, to Ms. Tonya Savage via e-mail or fax (see Section E – Points of Contact, paragraph (2)).

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to list additional questions and answers.  Therefore the questions and answers are listed as follows:

Questions and Answers:

(1)  Per Modification #4 of Solicitation #SAQMPD05R1006, Question 5.  Section L.7.2 requests three past performances.  In your clarification, you state that the Government requests Three (3) for each prime and sub.   This is a modification to the original requirement of three past performances.  Is it the Government’s intent to receive at a minimum of three (3) past performances for the team? No, it is intent to received a minimum of three (3) for the prime and a minimum three (3) for the sub.

(2) Per Modification #4 of Solicitation #SAQMPD05R1006, Question 11.  The question was asked about what page margins, font types and sizes a contractor should utilize when formatting the proposal.  Your response was 5 inch margins, 12 pitch, Times New Roman is preferred.   Can you please clarify?   Can a contractor use 11 pitch Times New Roman and 1 inch margins and still be within the formatting guidelines of the Solicitation Requirements.  “5 inch margins” that were listed is administratively incorrect and is deleted and replaced with “1 inch margins”, but the 12 pitch, Times New Roman is as stated.

(3)  Per Modification #4 of Solicitation #SAQMPD05R1006, Question 19.  Can the government please clarify their response to the questions asked?   The Government answers yes to the fact that they are only expecting an hourly rate and estimated hours for 1 Full Time Employee per labor category.  Then the government advises that contractor should propose costs/prices for the base and each option year?   From this verbiage are the contractors suppose to bid only labor categories as one full time employee and then escalate them out through the option years. Does the government want the proposed staffing as offered in the solicitation to be disregarded in this price quote?  Is the government only looking for labor rates for this solicitation? On the other hand, is the government looking for a price quote for labor rates and the proposed staffing that was given in the solicitation?  Question and Answer for 19 was posted as:   “19.  For pricing proposal, is the government looking for hour rates/estimated hours for one full-time equivalent under each labor category?     Yes..Or, are we expected to estimated the number of total hours for the entire contract under each labor category?     Yes, the contractor should proposed costs/prices for the base and each option year.”  Therefore, what the government has clearly stated that proposals received are expected to include price/cost for the base period and all option years that include the total amount of hours.  Meanwhile it is totally up to the contractors how they submit their proposals.

All else remains unchanged.

<CONTACT>J. Mays maysjl@nswccd.navy.mil J.D. Martin james.d.martin@navy.mil 812-854-3723 Please respond to both parties.
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. The Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) in support of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is soliciting industry comments, ideas, and issues on the trend towards government procurement of digital three-dimensional (3-D) product model data for mechanical products in place of two-dimensional (2-D) drawings.  This trend affects weapon system designers, equipment manufacturers, software tool vendors, and spare parts suppliers. NSWC in support of DLA is also soliciting input on how organizations are using 3-D geometry and industry product model data standards to improve your operations. Both DoD and the manufacturing industry can benefit from the adoption of 3-D data mechanical representations based on vendor-neutral international standards.  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 10303 STandard for the Exchange of Product model data (STEP) is an industry-developed exchange standard for providing digital 3-D product model data in a neutral format.  ISO Standard 10303, STEP has Application Protocols (APs) that provide mature, vendor-neutral data formats for representation of 2-D and 3-D mechanical part and assembly data.  These standards can be procured from the US Product Data Association on-line catalog at https://www.uspro.org/ . The initial acquisition of digital 3-D product model data will be for mechanical systems.  Analysis has shown that the best approach for documenting a complete (full-disclosure) Technical Data Package would be in accordance with: ·	ISO 10303-214:2001, Industrial automation systems and integration—Product data representation and exchange—Part 214: Application protocol: Core data for automotive mechanical design processes.  Conformance Class 20 includes 3-D data and drawings of the mechanical assembly.  This standard will be referred to as "AP 214."   ·	ISO 10303-232:2002, Industrial automation systems and integration—Product data representation and exchange—Part 232:  Application protocol: Technical data packaging core information and exchange provides the content and format of the metadata that is in the TDP.  This standard will be referred to as "AP 232." MIL-DTL-31000C, (Detail Specification Technical Data Packages) states: "When 3-dimensional solid models are the basis for the product data element, the solid models shall be complete, accurate, fully defined representations of the item and contain every feature the item being represented is intended to contain.  All information necessary to adequately define the item shall be contained in the 3D solid model to include but not limited to materials, tolerances, geometric tolerances, drawing notes, revision data, etc."  To meet this requirement, a complete implementation of AP 214 is needed. This solicitation requests industry input and comments on ISO 10303 about capabilities, plans, and issues.  Input is sought from: ·	Weapon system vendors on capabilities for delivering digital 3-D product model data to DoD customers  ·	CAD software vendors on current capabilities and intent to develop tools for creating and updating digital 3-D product model data and CAD data for mechanical systems  ·	Viewer software vendors on current capabilities and intent to develop tools for viewing and annotating digital 3-D product model data for mechanical systems ·	Spare parts vendors on capabilities for using 3-D product model data for manufacturing, inspection, and testing processes. Areas solicited for input and comment are listed below.  Respondents may provide information on these or any other issues they may wish to identify. 1. Weapons system vendors: ·	What are your issues with creating digital 3-D mechanical product model data for DoD customers? ·	What are your issues with delivering digital 3-D product model data to DoD customers in AP 214:2001 format? ·	What are your issues with delivering metadata content to DoD customers in AP 232:2002 format? 2. Software vendors: ·	What are the current capabilities of your viewers for Computer Aided Design software to read and display data from AP 214 files? ·	What level of demand would be required before viewer software vendors would fully implement AP 214? 3. Spare parts vendors: ·	What are your current capabilities for using 3-D mechanical product model data for manufacturing, inspection, and testing processes? ·	What are your current capabilities for using 3-D product model data in AP 214 format? ·	Are you currently receiving data in STEP format? ·	If so, what APs and what type of data? ·	What is your level of experience using STEP? 4. All: ·	From your organization's viewpoint, what are the risks and benefits of moving from a 2-D drawing-based environment to 3-D product model data? ·	From your organization's viewpoint, what are the risks and benefits of the proposed approach of using AP 214 to convey product model data and AP 232 to convey metadata? ·	Is there a need for a new STEP implementation method that can handle large data sets efficiently? ·	What additional features of STEP (e.g., construction history) are needed in order to allow exchange of a fully functional model between two CAD systems?  If these features were added, would vendors support them? ·	Is it useful to have CAD and product data management (PDM) data in a single file?  Why or why not? ·	Do the conformance classes of AP 214 match current industry capabilities? ·	What mandate from the Government would be necessary or desirable to enable industry to provide digital 3-D product model data to DoD customers in AP 214 format? ·	Are policy directives needed, beyond those already in place? ·	What changes or improvements to the STEP standard do you believe are necessary? 5. Other issues: Other issues not specifically mentioned in this RFI Please send information on concerns, ideas, or recommendations on 3-D data issues solicited in the RFI to: J. Mays maysjl@nswccd.navy.mil Naval Surface Warfare Center CD  Code 2230 (Building 192, Room 128)  9500 MacArthur Blvd  Bethesda, MD   20817-5700  Please be advised that your response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and in no obligates the Government under future procurement actions. Responses are requested on or before 8/12/05.

<CONTACT>MARYLOU DESSEAUX, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3217
<DESC>The U.S. Army Armaments Research, Development and Engineering Command (ARDEC) and PM Mortar Systems Office Picatinny, NJ is conducting a Sources Sought  Market Survey due 27 June 05.  This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a  Request for Proposal (RFP).  This market survey is for information and planning  purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by ARDEC.  Request for  Material Solutions to Improve M16 / M19 Mortar Plotting Boards.  ARDEC and the  PM Mortars are looking for feasible materiel solutions to determine if there  are any advances in materials technology that can be applied to the Plotting  Boards. The plotting board is an instrument used to compute the deflection,  range, and azimuth for indirect firing of mortars.  The M16 Plotting Board is  used with 81-mm M29 Mortar and the 120-mm M121 Mortar.  For Reference the  technical manual number is TM 9-1220-243-12&P.  The major issues with the  current system are:  (1)  This board is designed with a plastic base grid that  is reinforced by an aluminum panel.  The edges of the aluminum panel are folded  over the edge of the plastic base grid to lock the two sections together.  However, both materials are insufficiently rigid to prevent bending with  moderate to hard use.  The result is separation of the plastic and aluminum  panels.  (2)  Another problem is the durability of the azimuth disk.  This disk  rotates around a pivot point to provide an azimuth angle.  It is inserted into  the center of the base grid and it is captured by a retainer.  Unfortunately,  soldiers in the field need to clean dust and sand from between the base grid  and the azimuth disk.  When the soldier follows the maintenance instructions  for removal of the azimuth disk it tends to crack at the pivot point.   (3)  Alternatively, if a soldier tries to clean between the azimuth disk and  base grid without removing the disk, the disk also tends to crack at the pivot  point.  The offeror must:  (1) Provide a clear, complete, and specific  description of their ideas for the application of new materials (plastic,  metal, other) for replacement of the current materials in the design of new  plotting boards.  (2) Interested parties should submit ideas with respect to  materials changes only.  Redesign of the plotting boards is not requested via  this Markey Survey at this time. The proposed new material(s) for the plotting  boards should:  Facilitate assembly and disassembly of the base grid and the  Azimuth disk to permit cleaning in the field without cracking of the rotating  disk; or separating of the back panel.  Note:  Depending on the material, the  back panel can (or may) be eliminated to solve the separation issue; Maintain  or improve the accuracy of the azimuth and range solutions for all mortar  missions; Have little impact on the gunner's operations (e.g., visibility, disk  motion, etc);  Have no significant reduction in the current performance and  stability characteristics of currently fielded plotting boards; Be affordable  (desired); Manufacturable in quantities (>100) within 6 months (desired). Please respond with the following information:  Technical summary of the  proposed solution (include description, manufacturers, references, etc.); Specifications such as weight, durability, temperature stability, etc.; Rough Order of Magnitude Cost Estimate and availability of material to  fabricate 100 sets.  Contact Information for follow-up questions.  Information  provided is for government assessment on what is available to meet government  needs.  Respondents must label any technical data sent to in response to this  market survey with restrictive markings, if the response contains any trade  secrets, proprietary data or other confidential information that the  respondents want protected.  Interested sources may obtain copies of this  Market Survey located under Market Surveys and Sources Sought Notices on the  ARDEC Acquisition Web Page at: http://pc3.pica.army.mil.  All interested firms  regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this announcement. Responses to  this Market Survey should be sent to Mr. Thomas Peters, and shall include the  information requested above.  You may either email or send hard copies of your  response.  Mr. Peters's email address is tpeters@pica.army.mil.  No phone calls  please.  His mailing address is:  U. S.

<DESC>Source Sought FEDBIZOPS Announcement Sources Sought for Support: Analysis of the Department of Defense (DoD) Supply Chain. Title: Analysis of the Department of Defense Supply Chain. The NAICS code is 541614, and the size standard is $6MM.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  Defense Contracting Command-Washington (DCC-W), in support of the             Office of the Secretary of Defense, is conducting a market survey in accordance with FAR 10.0001 to determine the extent of Small Business participation and capability to perform the requirement summarized below and in accordance with the statement of work .  Here follows the Statement of Work: STATEMENT OF WORK Analysis of the Department of Defense Supply Chain (U) 1.0 OVERVIEW 1.1 Purpose: 	This Statement of Work (SOW) establishes the basic requirements for private sector support to the Office of the Secretary of Defense Program Analysis, and Evaluation (OSD(PA&E)).  The purpose of this contractual effort is to provide support in development  of an analytical foundation, in terms of definition, quantification, and evaluation of the Department of Defense (DoD) Supply Chain.   1.2 Background: 	The DoD operates a major supply chain and logistics networks on par or greater than most Fortune 500 companies.  Some estimates place the economic activity of these processes at close to $100 Billion annually.  	The DoD has made great strides in Logistics/Supply Chain governance, process review, and discussion of Logistics capabilities.  Ongoing transformational efforts such as Focused Logistics and the Logistics Transformation Roadmap are providing a common stra tegic framework and direction.   	However, we have limited visibility into DoD Supply Chain costs and performance, limited use of commercial benchmarks, and current Supply Chain metrics are uncoordinated to meet customers needs.  This analysis will support a concerted effort to improve t his visibility of DoD Supply Chain resources. 1.3 Objectives: 	The objectives of this contractual effort are to provide private sector analytical support to: (1)	Provide DoD senior decision makers with sufficient information to better understand current private sector Supply Chain Management.  This will enable an informed decision on how best to describe, define, and quantify the DoD Supply Chain.  Specifically , a.

Make available the firms current research, case studies, and ongoing analyses in Supply Chain Management. c.	Based on the above experience and analyses, develop a broad framework capturing the best of the firms lessons learned that highlight those areas that enterprises should focus on for Supply Chain Management success.  Based on the above experience, furth er highlight those areas that are judged to be applicable to the DoD. (2)	Review the Department of Defense Supply Chain end-to-end process from a private sector viewpoint.  Specifically, a.	Conduct a broad review of the end-to-end DoD Supply Chain process via unclassified documentation and interviews of Senior DoD Supply Chain officials. b.	Based on the above general review, conduct a more detailed review of those areas of the DoD Supply Chain identified by Objective 1 as being the most critical.  By review, this is to entail identification of potential private sector practices that mirror  the specific process, and potentially may enhance the DoD process.  This will be done via interviews and site visits. c.	Provide a summary report of the findings.   (3)	Based on the results of Objectives 1 and 2, provide private sector metrics of Supply Chain activities that have potential applicability to the DoD Supply Chain.  This will enable an informed decision on how to best to meas ure efficiency and effectiveness of the DoD Supply Chain.  (4)	Provide a recommended framework that would enable the DoD to evaluate DoD supply chain performance versus commercial benchmarks.   2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 	OSD(PA&E) shall make available points of contacts and organizations relating to the requirements in support of this task. 3.0 PROJECT MANAGEMENT  	The Offeror shall provide all of the services required to efficiently and effectively manage the accomplishment of the tasks prescribed in this SOW.

<SUBJECT>70--Data Visualization Software
<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Corda Technologies Inc, Lindon, UT.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U.S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).  The Health Resources and Services Administration has a need to procure maintenance of Corda products currently in use as well as additional products to extend the functionality of their data visualization software.  All HRSA websites must comply with requirements of Section 508 (www.section508.gov).  After assessing available data visualization software, it was decided that Corda Popchart Enterprise and Optimap, as the best available tools to meet this need.  This purchase order extends the maintenance agreement on this installation for one year.  In addition, HRSA is adding Highwire to the Corda Server bundle; a second Developer bundle; and a third Corda Builder license with maintenance agreements to bring all of the installation onto the same schedule for maintenance in future years.  Through the use of market research it has been determined that the equipment required by HRSA is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements.  Other manufacturers have been considered, but do not meet compatibility requirements.  The use of alternate sources would result in a duplication of effort and cost that would not be recovered through competition.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.

<SUBJECT>70--SEWP IV ANNOUNCEMENT (ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS)
<DESC>SEWP IV Announcement (One-on-One Interviews) NASA SEWP is a Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for Information Technology (IT) products and solutions. NASA SEWP offers a wide range of advanced technology servers, peripherals, network equipment, and other IT products to all Federal Agencies. More information about the current contracts may be found at the SEWP III website: http://www.sewp.nasa.gov . As part of the acquisition process for the follow-on to SEWP III, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) will be conducting market research through one-on-one interviews with interested companies.  The purpose of these interviews is to give industry an opportunity to provide the Government with the latest information on current and up-coming IT products and trends.  One-on-one interviews are part of NASA’s continuing dialogue with industry concerning new and outstanding technology, NASA’s technology requirements, and SEWP. There will be 48 one-on-one interviews available beginning on Thursday, July 7, 2005 through Monday, July 18, 2005.  Appointments will be scheduled for no more than 45 minutes each on a space available basis, in the order of the date and time of receipt of the on-line request, as detailed below. Requests for specific dates and times will not be honored.  Interested parties desiring to participate in this process should register and sign-up for a time slot at the SEWP IV Registration Website https://www.sewp.nasa.gov/registration , beginning 12:00 noon (Eastern Standard Time) on June 28, 2005.	Registrations will not be accepted prior to that date and time.  On-line registration at this site is the only acceptable response.  Written responses, e-mails, or telephone calls are not acceptable for registration purposes. The SEWP Program Office will contact interested parties to schedule specific dates and times for appointments.  No further interviews will be scheduled after all available appointments (48 in total) have been filled.  There will be no exceptions.  NASA is requesting vendors limit their participants to three people for the interviews. The Government will respond, to the greatest extent possible, to written comments and questions submitted in advance of the interviews; however, vendors are encouraged to use the one-on-one interview time to showcase their company’s capabilities. Each interview (including responses to questions and comments) will be limited to 45 minutes, and vendors should plan accordingly.  Please submit your written comments, along with SEWP IV specific questions electronically to sewp4@sewp.nasa.gov at least 48 hours prior to your scheduled interview.  Only comments and questions submitted at least 48 hours in advance will be addressed at the interviews.   While the time available for the presentation portion of this activity is limited, there will be further opportunities for all interested parties to provide feedback and comments as the follow-on process for SEWP IV continues. NASA will not comment directly on this activity beyond this and similar announcements including information on the SEWP IV schedule which will be announced as the information becomes available through FedBizOpps and other appropriate mechanisms.  Individuals registering at the NASA SEWP IV registration page, even if they are not participating in the upcoming industry presentations, will automatically be notified via e-mail of all future events and milestones.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. 1000375. These solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. The North American Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710. This is a small business set-aside. The FDA intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Joseph Sheehan for a professional service contract for the FDA’s Office of Device Evaluation (ODE) to assist on regulatory policies associated with premarket medical device submissions for the Center of Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). The contractor shall provide the following services: 1) Provide a critical element of review in addressing many pressing regulatory policy issues, such as reclassification actions, transfer of ownership, limitations to exemption, and convenience kit policy associated with the premarket submission review; 2) Provide expertise to FDA staff on the application of various statutes, regulations, and Executive Orders on regulatory issues concerning medical devices and radiological health including the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Administrative Procedures Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act among others; 3) Assist the Office with regulatory issues related to reclassification actions, transfer of ownership, limitations to exemption, among other regulatory issues associated with the premarket submission review; 4) Provide a regulatory counsel knowledge base that the office currently does not have on staff.  This work will be done primarily through teleconferencing and meeting consults.  In addition, the contractor shall help and assist with regulatory issues related to premarket submission processes that will have a great impact on the Office’s ability to properly administer many of the more complex, from a regulatory standpoint, premarket submissions.  The contractor will also: 1) Serve as a consultant to the 510(k) Staff in the Office’s Program Operations Staff; 2) Provide expertise and input into regulatory policy issues, such as reclassification actions, transfer of ownership, and limitations to exemption, associated with the premarket submission review; 3) Attend meetings and teleconferences and he will participate in the development of regulations, guidance documents, and administrative policies and procedures for regulating medical devices.  The following FAR Clauses shall apply to this solicitation: 52.212-1. 52.212-2, 52-212-4, 52-212-5 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 52.214-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers. All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit written quotations by the due date referenced above. The award is being issued on a sole source basis because Mr. Sheehan is an expert in medical device regulation and CDRH regulatory policy. Mr. Sheehan is the only known source who has the background and experience in the medical device review process and regulatory matters to meet the FDA’s requirements. It would be most cost effective to use this contractor since he has extensive knowledge of CDER regulatory policy. All questions should be submitted in writing via e-mail to TONEILL@OC.FDA.GOV or fax to 301-827-7101. FAR provisions can be found at the following website: http://www/arnet.gov.

***Statement of Work for Modification and Repair to (2) paint booths***

Scope
The primary objective of this Statement of Work is to provide an outline of the modifications to be performed and repairs needed to return the two paint booths to a fully functional condition.

·	Travis AFB, Bldg 803
o	Paint Spray Booth, 2 each 


Basic Services
The vendor will be required to perform all modifications, repairs, or service to the two locally manufactured paint booths’ current exhaust ventilation systems, which are not performing to the requirements of the shape and size of the booths. The current design of the paint booths and filter systems do not allow for the proper volume of air flow and filtration required to protect the carbon filter bank from dust contaminates. In addition, the make-up air is overpowering the exhaust air and pushing the entry doors open. 

Booth description  
The current design of the two paint booths are shown in the attached pictures along with this description. The booths have two man doors each on either side, for a total of four personnel entry points. Each end of the paint booth has a double bi-fold door that goes from floor to top of the booth.  Each booth has an overhead carbon filter bank containing a total of  40, 20” X 20” filters each. The current particle filtration system is single stage with a carbon filter bank at the end of the line and a total of 28- 20” x 20” exhaust filters each at the front of the system (14 on each side) per booth with the ducting on the outside of the booth running up the side walls to the carbon bank. The banks are exhausted by a 20 horse 3 phase 2 speed 20” exhaust fan on each of the two carbon filter banks. Each booth has airline regulators and connections at all four corners. Each booth is equipped with an overpressure / heater fan system placed on top of its respective booth. Along the side walls are 4’ florescent lights (see pictures for details).  The booths are constructed of galvanized steel.  Booth #1 is 15 feet wide, 36 feet long and 24 feet high; booth #2 is 15 feet wide, 46 feet long and 24 feet high. Both are attached to a concrete floor. 
 
Required modifications/ repairs
·	The four man doors need a new latch similar to a walk-in freezer style, as shown in one of the attached pictures. Heavy duty

·	The overhead carbon filter banks containing a total of 40 each 20” X 20” will need to be emptied and new carbon placed in these filter boxes.   

·	The booths will require a complete modification of the total number of filters and the ducting system as follows: 

·	56 additional filters to equal a total of 84 per booth need to be installed.  All additions to the booths will be made to the outside of the booth as space is limited on the inside walls.

·	Additional ducting to be routed for the increase of air flow volume through the exhaust filters. All old ducting to be vacuumed out and waste disposed of using government supplied containers (see “The Government will provide” for further details).

·	All lighting needing to be moved due to ducting/ filter placement will be relocated.  Relocation is required to prevent loss of existing total candle power.   

·	Vendor will perform a function test for all equipment upon completion of project. 

·	If any work requires deactivating or moving of any fire suppression nozzle/bottle from its current location, vendor will insure all fire suppression systems are in working order. The system is a pressurized dry chemical system. Original vendor for fire suppression was Code Three, located on railroad Ave. Suisun city Ca. 94585   

·	All air lines moved or disconnected will be placed in an appropriate area as required by booth position and filter modification and returned to a working order. 

Travel
 The contractor shall arrange and execute all travel necessary for the performance of the requirements in this SOW. 

The Government will provide:
·	The government will provide containers and disposal for all current hazardous materials created by both paint booths prior the start of any repairs or modifications.  This is to include, but not limited to, the paint dust from inside the ducting, all carbon in the carbon filter boxes, current used filters, paper within the booths.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. *** This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-03. ***The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334510.  The associated Standards Industrial Classification Code (SIC) for this procurement is 3845.  All interested parties may submit a quote. ***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a cryogenic high temperature thermal conductivity measurement instrument.  All interested parties are invited to submit a quote for the following line items: LINE ITEM NO. 0001: Cryogenic Probe Station with Vertical Magnetic Field Capability, Quantity 1 Each, in accordance with the following:  
(A) Background: Revealing the fundamental nature of electron-transport in nanoscale semiconductor structures requires non-conventional electrical measurement techniques.  Very low temperature measurements (below 4K) are often necessary to observe quantum effects in current-voltage characteristics.  Using a conventional probe-station, this is nearly impossible as a vacuum chamber is needed for this cryogenic operation with helium supply for the cooling.  In addition, the probes have to be maintained at the same temperature as the sample to minimize thermal voltage and to reduce the background electrical noise in the measurement system.  Low noise operation is crucial in this type of low-voltage (~10-9 V), low current (~10-12 Amps) measurements.  To understand the interaction of the internal energy levels of these semiconducting nanostructures with magnetic field (i.e Landau splitting, Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation), magneto-transport measurements of these nanostructures are also frequently required.  To perform successful magneto-transport measurements, the required field strength must be over 2 Tesla.  In addition, low temperature magneto-transport measurements should provide a new dimension in understanding the quantum behavior of these nanostructures.  For these reasons this cryogenic probe station is required to have a vertical magnetic field capability (in which the magnetic field is normal to the sample). This is necessary to not only permit basic measurements (such as resistivity as a function of temperature, Hall mobility, activation energy of the dopants), but also to perform more sophisticated state-of-the-art measurements and to develop metrology techniques for nanoscale quantum structures and devices. 
(B) Minimum Specifications (Basic System Requirements):
1.  A minimum of four micro-manipulated probes allowing electrical measurements on 1" x 1" square samples with arbitrarily located contacts. 
2.  Each probe shall be capable of minimum travel distances of 2" in-sample plane along probe axis, of 1" in-sample plane perpendicular to probe axis, and 0.5" normal to sample plane. 
3. The chamber shall have at least 2 unutilized vacuum ports.
4. The chamber shall have a top view-port through which the sample can be observed.
5.  The view-port shall have IR-absorbing window to minimize external radiative heating.
6.  System shall come with a complete optics system able to resolve features to better than 4 microns and allowing viewing of any part of the 1" square sample as well as digital image transfer capability.
7. Sample stage shall open to air to permit mounting of specimens.
8.  Company shall be able to manufacture probes compatible with this system over a range of sizes (with tip radius ranging from at most 5 microns up to at least 25 microns) made of W, BeCu or similar durable alloys (this is required for compatibility with future needs).
9.  System shall be re-configurable for measurements up to at least 50 GHz without major modification (replacement of probe arms permitted). 
10. Specimen chamber shall be able to be evacuated to 5 x 10-5 Torr or better at room temperature; diffusion pumping is not permitted.
11.  System must be configured to permit an external voltage to be applied directly to the sample stage or holder for back-gate type measurements without using one of the four probes for this purpose.
12.  The system should come with its own table and with a fully functional vibration isolation system.
(C ) Operating Temperature Requirements:
1.  The system shall be capable of operating down to 2 K or below with a measurement accuracy of + or - 1 K.  This lower limit of temperature operation is required to be guaranteed and verified in on-site demonstration. 
2.  The system shall be able to operate up to at least 400 K.
3.  System shall be equipped with all necessary pumps and fittings for pumping on liquid helium to attain 2 K operation.
4. Probe to outside connections shall be a "triax" type permitting operation over entire temperature range up to frequencies at or above 500 Mhz.
5. The probe tips shall be maintained at the same temperature as the sample to minimize the thermal voltage (for example, through thermal anchoring on the stage). At least one probe shall be equipped to permit independent monitoring of the temperature near the tip.
6. The system must come with all the necessary controller and power supplies for independent control of the sample and magnet temperatures.
(D) Magnetic Field Capability:
1.  The probe station shall have a vertical magnetic field capability with field strength of at least 2.5 Tesla.
2. The magnet shall be superconducting solenoid type and should come complete with its own cryogenics and low noise power supply.
3. The magnetic field shall be variable with 0.1 Tesla (or smaller) step size.
4. The superconducting magnet shall be capable of operation at all measurement temperatures.
5. The magnetic field system shall be capable of being upgraded for a horizontal field (for compatibility with future needs).
(E) General:
Company shall install the system at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland, demonstrate all capabilities and train users on operating procedures.

The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are as follows:  (a) The Government will award up to three (3) contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following  factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   (i)	The technical capability of the item(s) offered to meet the Government requirement as described above.  Offers will be evaluated to determine if the product(s) offered meet or exceed each of the minimum specifications identified above.  Each line item will be evaluated separately.  Offers shall include sufficient technical documentation regarding the specifications of the offered product(s) for the Government to determine if all the minimum requirements stated above are met or exceeded.  Offerors may su bmit a quote for one, two or all three line items.  Offers shall specifically identify which contract line item (0001, 0002 or 0003) any product offered is in response to.   (ii)	Price.  The Government intends to award a contract, or contracts, for the lowest-priced items meeting all the stated minimum requirements.    Price will be the critical factor in determining which technically acceptable offer will be the awardee.  Con versely, for any product offered that does not meet the stated minimum specifications, price is irrelevant. (iii)	Past performance.  Offers shall include evidence of identical or very similar items having been sold in the past. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  If an offer includes a product that does not meet each of the stated minimum specifications, that offer will not be further evaluated or considered for award for t hat line item.  For each line item; among offers that meet all of the minimum technical requirements; award will be made to that offeror with the lowest proposed fixed price.  If an offer does not include a quote for one or two of the line items, it will s till be considered for the line item(s) quoted.  If an offer is determined to be not technically acceptable (i.e., not meeting all the stated minimum specifications) for one or two line items, it will still be considered for the line item(s) that were dete rmined to be technically acceptable.    (x)	Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, and DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications -Commercial Items, with its offer. 		(xi)  The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  		(xii)  The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items and DFARS 252.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defe nse Acquisitions of Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The following additional FAR/DFARS clauses cited in this clause are applicable: 52.203-3, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-33, 252.225-7001, 252.247-7023.

Questions/Answers:

Q1) The inspection of the gearbox in most case we would replace all bearings and seal, OCE has found that some bearings could be bad or seal and gaskets would be damaged once we opened the gearbox's. This has been our standard operation for the past 10 years, could you please advise.

During the inspection the inspector must provide strong evidence to support the inspection of any gearbox. The order is only for inspections. Any repair service orders shall be contracted separately under a separate procurement. 

Q2) What is the length and height of the runways? 

A2) The site visit provided each potential offeror a clear view for the condition of the crane inspection. The information requested is not readily available.

Q3) And most important of all is there a safety line in place for our men to walk the rail? if not would we need to install one? 

A3)  OSHA provides all of the safety requirements necessary to perform a safe crane inspection. The Contractor must follow their own safety plans necessary to comply with OSHA safety standards.

Q4) If no line is to be used, is there going to room for a man-lift to perform this inspection and laser check?

A4) The Contractor shall provide all materials, equipment, and labor necessary to complete the crane inspection. The Contractor shall make their own decision for addition equipment necessary for the inspections.   

Q5) The information on the rail check is this for the bridge crane only or all monorails? If I can get the height and length of the runways for 1-4, 11-15, 18,18, 20,21, 26,27, 29, 33,34, 37, 42,43, 55-57, 67, 68 70, 76, &79

A5)  The laser check shall only be for the cranes and locations given.  The information is not readily available. The site visit provided each potential offeror an opportunity to make any necessary measurements.
