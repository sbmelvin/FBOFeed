<DESC>The Pacific Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Acquisition Department (ACQ0241), intends to issue a solicitation for an OMB Circular A-76 Cost Comparison Study for work currently being provided by the Navy Public Works Center, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.  This acquisition will comply with the procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76, the Commercial Activities (CA) program. This A-76 cost comparison study will examine the possibility of converting Government in-house operations to contractor operations. This solicitation may result in the award of a combination Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) and Indefinite Quantity (IQ) type contract. This solicitation will be set aside for small business concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541350 (previously SIC code 7389).  The applicable size standard is $5 million.   The period of performance includes a 6-month base period with 4 options to extend the term for a total period not to exceed 54 months.  A Best Value selection will be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically acceptable with the lowest evaluated price.  The Government may make an award based on initial proposals without conducting discussions if the Contracting Officer determines discussions are not necessary.  If the best value contractor is the successful service provider as a result of the cost comparison, the estimated date of contract award is November 2002 with full performance starting April 2003.  Following the selection of a best value contractor, a cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the work currently performed by Government personnel to contract performance will be conducted.  A contract will not be awarded unless the costs of contracting are lower than the costs of continued Government performance by a minimum cost differential of the lesser of 10% of in-house personnel-related costs or $10 million over the performance period.  Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of government-performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified.  The services required are facilities inspection services, which include inspection and certification of boilers and unfired pressure vessels (UPV).  Also included under this work category for this solicitation are Pavement Condition Inspections, Boiler/UPV Consultation Services and Limited Inspection Services.  The entire solicitation will be available after 13 March 2002 for viewing or downloading.  Request for additional information may be addressed to the attention of Ms. Jill Nii via email at pacdiva76@efdpac.navfac.navy.mil or faxed to (808) 471-4391.  It is the Government's intention to issue this solicitation electronically through the Internet at http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil and at www.fedbizops.gov . All interested parties are advised to register in E-Sol as a plan holder.  This will normally be the only method of distribution of amendments, therefore it is the offeror's responsibility to periodically check the web site for amendments to the solicitation.  

Prospective offerors are encouraged to subscribe to both web sites. RESPONSE DATE:  Closing time for receipt of proposals is 12 June 2002 by 2:00 P.M., HST, at Pacific Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Building 57, Pearl Harbor, HI  96860-3134 Attn: (Code 0241)

<DESC>The University of California, which operates Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits Letters of Interest from companies that wish to become a distributor of several LANL-developed software products.  Company qualifications will be assessed on 
?       demonstrated track record in software marketing and distribution, 
?       experience in electronic distribution systems, 
?       ability to provide customer support service, 
?       ability to provide technical product support service, and 
?       technical resources for further software development.


Software products to be distributed represent a variety of scientific research tools and consumer end products.  Certain software products may be covered by patents as well as copyrights.  The selected company will enter into a licensing arrangement with the University.  We anticipate that successful commercialization will require extensive interaction between company and LANL software developers.  In many cases distributors will be able to contract the LANL software developers to maintain and improve software products.

Interested companies are hereby notified that this opportunity is not a procurement.

Any company interested in this opportunity must respond with a Letter of Interest that describes how the company meets the requirements listed above.  Respondents are encouraged to provide additional documentation such as annual reports, website addresses, and product samples.  The Letter of Interest must be received on or before March 31, 2002.  Please send Letters of Interest to the attention of Kathleen Herrera, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Mail Stop C334, Los Alamos, New Mexico, 87545.  

Qualified companies will be asked to submit a comprehensive business plan at a later date.

For additional information, contact Ms. Herrera at kaherrera@lanl.gov or

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items description, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This notice constitutes the only solicitation, a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation, No. 263-02-B(BD)-0030, is issued as a Invitation for Bid.  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 03.  The North American Industrial Standard Code code is 325412, and business size is 500 employees. This is not a small business set-aside. The National Institutes of Health(NIH), has a requirement for a electron Microscope system. This system shall include, but not be limited to, the following performance characteristics, features, and pertain to the following components:  1) Ice contamination rate shall be less than 0.5 nanometer per hour in order to perform cryoelectron microscopy of macromolecules in one hour after 50 sheets of film have been loaded in the camera. 2) The system shall operate at 300 kV beam voltage minimum in order to provide adequate electron penetration to perform electron tomography on 0.5 micrometer thick sections of cells tilted to angles of 70 degrees.  3) The system shall be compatible with software that performs fully automated electron tomography of beam-sensitive biological specimens in-low dose mode. This shall include precise correction for all axis alignments of the specimen (including focus, coma, intensity, position) and at a minimum collects an automated 120 image tilt series in less than 40 minutes in the low dose mode. 4) In transmission electron microscopy (TEM) operation, the point resolution shall be better than 0.25 nanometer and the line resolution better than 0.15 nanometer, commensurate with structural studies. For structural studies of proteins, the instrument shall be capable of achieving an information limit of 0.18 nanometer for low atomic number biological structures. 5).To study the structure of cellular organelles efficiently, the instrument shall provide magnification from 100x magnification to 700,000x magnification using a single control. For studying the composition of whole cells, the instrument shall operate with the objective lens switched on, at less than 150x magnification to obtain a minimum of 2,700 square micrometers field of view with a post column energy filter. The instrument shall maintain full resolution while operating in this fashion. 6).The instrument shall perform quantitative mass mapping of macromolecular assemblies in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode at beam voltages of 300 kV, 200 kV, and 100 kV with a probe diameter below 0.5 nanometers.  The STEM performance at all three voltages shall be sufficient to resolve graphite 0.34 nanometers lattice fringes with frame times of 100 seconds or longer, a performance that shall be commensurate with structural studies of macromolecules.  STEM operation shall also be possible at 50 kV beam energy with a probe diameter of less than 1.0 nanometer in situations where knock-on damage is a limitation. 7) The electron source shall have high coherence to provide adequate contrast for unstained biological specimens.  Graphitized carbon 0.34 nanometer lattice fringes shall be resolved at a defocus of 2 micrometers with a exposure time of 1 second, commensurate with low-dose cryoelectron microscopy of macromolecular assemblies. 8) A spatial resolution of 0.23 nanometers point to point shall be obtainable at magnifications down to 60,000x magnification and graphite 0.34 nanometer lattice fringes shall be obtainable down to 40,000x, magnification commensurate with low-dose cryoelectron microscopy of macromolecular assemblies.9) For analytical applications to measure elemental composition of biological specimens, the instrument shall pass a current of 0.5 nanoampere into a probe diameter of 1.0 nanometer.10) Operation with beam-sensitive specimens requires complex changes in electron optical parameters to maintain efficient data collection under low dose conditions. Operation of the instrument shall therefore be fully transparent in terms of control and read-out of all functions whether they are resident in the main instrument or resident in the accessories.  11) The instrument shall either: (A) accommodate three existing FEI-compatible cryo-specimen holders, as manufactured by Gatan Inc., to perform cryoelectron microscopy on (i) sets of three frozen hydrated specimens for studies of macromolecules and cryosectioned cells, (ii) frozen-hydrated specimens that are tilted to +/- 80 degrees for cryo-tomography, (iii) cryosections studied by x-ray microanalysis, or: (B) include three new cryo-specimen holders to meet the same specifications. If new holders are provided, they must be able to resolve 0.34 nanometer graphite lattice fringes at a temperature below -170 degrees Celsius .12) The accelerating voltage stability should better than 2 electron-volts per hour at 300 kV for electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) operation for analyzing the elemental composition of biological specimens. The Government anticipates the award of an fixed-price definite Delivery, The required delivery schedule shall be 90 calender days after contract award.  If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule.

<DESC>NA This is a Notice to Industry of a Request for Proposal of a U. S. Army requirement for approximately 725 each EPLRS Upgrade Kits for EPLRS Receiver Transmitter (RT’s). These Upgrade Kits will ensure that all EPLRS RT’s previously delivered for the Air Forc e SADL will have the same functional capabilities and ensure interoperability with the Army Transportation Brigades, The Kits consist of the Signal Message Processor (SMP) and the Communications Security (COMSEC) modules.  The main function of the SMP modu le is the encoding and decoding of the transmitted and received signals.  The COMSEC module is responsible for the encryption and decryption of the transmitted and received signals.  The Upgrade Kits will provide improved operational compatibility in the f ield and improve data throughout the SADL. A sole source acquisition to Raytheon Company, Fullerton, CA, is proposed for this Acquisition pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  The Government does not posses adequate technical data to define the performance or interface requirements  for this EPLRS equipment, which precludes a competitive acquisition.  Raytheon Co. is the developer, manufacturer and current supplier of the various EPLRS configurations.  This notice is published for informational purposes only.  See numbered notes 22 a nd 26.

THE LATTER IMPLEMENT PROVIDES CAPABILITY FOR BASE CUTTING OF THE SALTCEDAR NEAR THE SOIL SURFACE, FOLLOWED BY SKIDDING OF THE CUT MATERIAL TO THE PLOT OR STUDY PERIMETER, LEAVING WINDROWED OR PILED MATERIAL.  DUE TO THE DENSITY OF THE SALT CEDAR THIS SERVICE REQUIRES USE OF GPS TRACKING.

HOWEVER, ALL PROPOSALS RECEIVED BY MARCH 15, 2002 WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE WITH THIS PROPOSED CONTRACT BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.

<DESC>Notice of Intent.  The U. S. Customs Service (USCS)intends to solicit and award an order to Barringer Instruments, Inc., 30 Technology Drive, Warren, NJ 07059-5166 for a dual narcotics and explosives screening system, the GC-IONSCAN.  Barringer Instruments is the only company who has integrated gas chromatography and ion mobility spectrometry into a scientific instrument capable of field usage.  This will allow USCS to conduct large-scale operations in a field environment while maintaining scientific credibility associated with a laboratory environment.  The unit also has a solid phase sampling and desorption system which will replace liquid extraction routinely used in gas chromatographic analyses, thereby saving time and resources in chemical sampling and analyses.  Having the equipment available at the port of entry to conduct the analyses in real time will expedite the number of samples taken and enable U. S. Customs scientists to take appropriate actions in the event of high readings of carcinogenic pesticides or other trace chemicals.  This requirement will be processed under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1), ony one responsible source, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  No telephone requests.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture, and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The technology relates to methodologies and systems that immobilize a variety of enzymes on functionalized porous inorganic support structures.  The technology enhances thermal and chemical robustness of the enzyme while maintaining a high catalytic activity over a wide range of environment conditions.  Organophosphorous hydrolase, glucose oxidase, and glucose isomerase systems have been successfully demonstrated using self-assembled monolayers on mesoporous silica using a variety of functionalizing moieties.  Such engineered structures have also been disposed in microchannels to enhance heat and/or mass transfer, reduce reactor size, retain a low pressure drop, and decrease reaction times.  The technology provides an opportunity for the development of the next generation of highly active, stable, and durable biocatalytic reactor systems for sensing devices, energy production, chemical synthesis (hydrolysis, oxidation, hydrogenation, and proteolysis) and degradation, and environmental cleanup.  
Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>NAWCTSD intends to award a firm fixed price sole source contract to Hamilton Sunstrand of Windsor Locks, CT, for the development and delivery of the Virginia Class Integrated Low Pressure Electrolyzer (ILPE) Front Panel Simulator (FPS) with integrated part task trainers.  The ILPE represents a radical departure in design and operation from the current class of oxygen generators in the fleet.  It is entirely microprocessor controlled and the vast majority of the indicators are electronic vice mechanical devices.  There are numerous inputs that require simulation to create a viable FPS. A key component is the ability to run the tactical software and include mechanical part task trainers that were designed by the tactical developer.  Hamilton Sunstrand is the developer of the tactical ILPE and has developed software to test the functionality of the unit over the life of its development.  This software interacts with the tactical software, supplied in firmware, to replicate the actions of the ILPE to the operators.  Any suppliers capable of providing this item exactly as described are invited to identify themselves to the contract specialist, Mr. Alan Wright.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 611430   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for a risk assessment workshop design, presentation, and instructor training.  The contractor shall design a 2 1/2 day workshop on the principles of air pollution and multimedia risk assessment.  The specific requirements of this contract are to:  (1) design the workshop using existing ESD risk assessment background materials; (2) present the first workshop to EPA staff; (3) provide workbooks, handouts, and other instructional aids for up to 40 students, plus one set of original instructional  materials (hard copy and electronic); and (4) train up to 20 ESD staff members to become instructors for future presentations of the workshop.   It is currently anticipated that the first workshops will be presented at EPA facilities in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina, in June 2002.   All materials produced in this effort will be considered property of the EPA.  In addition to the above tasks, another requirement of this contract is for the contractor to facilitate discussions with ESD staff for the purpose of defining overall objectives and content for a separate workshop on  risk management.   However, in contrast to the risk assessment workshop tasks, the contractor is not required to assist in presenting the workshop, preparing instructional aids, or providing instructor training.   Using existing technical materials to be provided by ESD (e.g., approximately 250  overhead slides presenting risk assessment concepts), the contractor shall design an innovative, comprehensive, and highly interactive training workshop using the latest accelerated learning instructional techniques.  (Accelerated learning incorporates concepts such as left brain/right brain  function, the triune brain theory, and multiple intelligences to create a highly effective learning environment that maximizes learning speed and retention.)  EPA anticipates the award of a fixed price purchase order.   This procurement is a total small business set-aside and the NAICS code number  is 611430 with a size standard of $5M in average annual receipts over the preceding three fiscal years.  The Request for Quotation (RFQ) is expected to be issued approximately 3/12/02 and quotations will be due approximately 3/27/02.  The RFQ and amendments will be available via the Internet World  Wide Web at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.   Firms are encouraged to access the RFQ and amendments via the Internet.  If you will be obtaining a copy of the RFQ via Internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the RFQ is posted for any ensuing amendments.   Firms who do not have the capability to obtain the RFQ from the Internet, may submit a written request for a diskette with the RFQ in WordPerfect 9 format from the contact point at the address above; however, only those firms who do NOT have the capability to obtain the RFQ from the Internet should  request a copy of the diskette.   Diskettes will not be sent to those firms who have Internet access.  If you request a diskette of the Request for Quotation, you will receive amendments by mail, unless you notify us otherwise.  Telephone and fax requests will not be honored.  Only one copy shall  be sent to a corporate entity, regardless of the number of requests from one or more different geographic locations.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the Agency.   Note 1 applies

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items description, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This notice constitutes the only solicitation, a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation, No. 263-02-B(BD)-0030, is issued as a Invitation for Bid.  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 03.  The North American Industrial Standard Code code is 325412, and business size is 500 employees. This is not a small business set-aside. The National Institutes of Health(NIH), has a requirement for a electron Microscope system. This system shall include, but not be limited to, the following performance characteristics, features, and pertain to the following components:  1) Ice contamination rate shall be less than 0.5 nanometer per hour in order to perform cryoelectron microscopy of macromolecules in one hour after 50 sheets of film have been loaded in the camera. 2) The system shall operate at 300 kV beam voltage minimum in order to provide adequate electron penetration to perform electron tomography on 0.5 micrometer thick sections of cells tilted to angles of 70 degrees.  3) The system shall be compatible with software that performs fully automated electron tomography of beam-sensitive biological specimens in-low dose mode. This shall include precise correction for all axis alignments of the specimen (including focus, coma, intensity, position) and at a minimum collects an automated 120 image tilt series in less than 40 minutes in the low dose mode. 4) In transmission electron microscopy (TEM) operation, the point resolution shall be better than 0.25 nanometer and the line resolution better than 0.15 nanometer, commensurate with structural studies. For structural studies of proteins, the instrument shall be capable of achieving an information limit of 0.18 nanometer for low atomic number biological structures. 5).To study the structure of cellular organelles efficiently, the instrument shall provide magnification from 100x magnification to 700,000x magnification using a single control. For studying the composition of whole cells, the instrument shall operate with the objective lens switched on, at less than 150x magnification to obtain a minimum of 2,700 square micrometers field of view with a post column energy filter. The instrument shall maintain full resolution while operating in this fashion. 6).The instrument shall perform quantitative mass mapping of macromolecular assemblies in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode at beam voltages of 300 kV, 200 kV, and 100 kV with a probe diameter below 0.5 nanometers.  The STEM performance at all three voltages shall be sufficient to resolve graphite 0.34 nanometers lattice fringes with frame times of 100 seconds or longer, a performance that shall be commensurate with structural studies of macromolecules.  STEM operation shall also be possible at 50 kV beam energy with a probe diameter of less than 1.0 nanometer in situations where knock-on damage is a limitation. 7) The electron source shall have high coherence to provide adequate contrast for unstained biological specimens.  Graphitized carbon 0.34 nanometer lattice fringes shall be resolved at a defocus of 2 micrometers with a exposure time of 1 second, commensurate with low-dose cryoelectron microscopy of macromolecular assemblies. 8) A spatial resolution of 0.23 nanometers point to point shall be obtainable at magnifications down to 60,000x magnification and graphite 0.34 nanometer lattice fringes shall be obtainable down to 40,000x, magnification commensurate with low-dose cryoelectron microscopy of macromolecular assemblies.9) For analytical applications to measure elemental composition of biological specimens, the instrument shall pass a current of 0.5 nanoampere into a probe diameter of 1.0 nanometer.10) Operation with beam-sensitive specimens requires complex changes in electron optical parameters to maintain efficient data collection under low dose conditions. Operation of the instrument shall therefore be fully transparent in terms of control and read-out of all functions whether they are resident in the main instrument or resident in the accessories.  11) The instrument shall either: (A) accommodate three existing FEI-compatible cryo-specimen holders, as manufactured by Gatan Inc., to perform cryoelectron microscopy on (i) sets of three frozen hydrated specimens for studies of macromolecules and cryosectioned cells, (ii) frozen-hydrated specimens that are tilted to +/- 80 degrees for cryo-tomography, (iii) cryosections studied by x-ray microanalysis, or: (B) include three new cryo-specimen holders to meet the same specifications. If new holders are provided, they must be able to resolve 0.34 nanometer graphite lattice fringes at a temperature below -170 degrees Celsius .12) The accelerating voltage stability should better than 2 electron-volts per hour at 300 kV for electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) operation for analyzing the elemental composition of biological specimens. The Government anticipates the award of an fixed-price definite Delivery, The required delivery schedule shall be 90 calender days after contract award.  If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule.  However, the offeror?s proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the Government?s REQUIRED delivery schedule of (180) calender days after award of the contract. Award will be made to the lowest, responsive, responsible bidder meeting all the required performance characteristics specified herein. Delivery shall be made FOB Destination within consignees premises to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. The Contractor will be paid following delivery and acceptance of the microscope.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) seeks to increase the maximum hours for Phases 3 and 4 of an existing contract with Morneau Sobeco for the continuation of services related to:  the acquisition of the ARIEL software package; periodic technical and actuarial updates for the software package; services to support its modification to meet PBGC requirements; its implementation at PBGC; and the integration of selected pension plans into the modified software package.  Morneau Sobeco is the owner of the ARIEL software package and is therefore the only firm with knowledge of the product sufficient to provide periodic technical and actuarial updates.  The increase in hours will cover PBGC's need to, on occasion, accept benefits computed by plan sponsors rather than perform the calculation using participant data.  Benefits might be accepted rather than computed because participant data is not available, or because benefit estimates must be produced prior to the availability of plan data or documents.  Since sponsors calculated benefits are most frequently accepted when participant data is missing, ARIEL must be modified to respond appropriately to missing participant data, accept entered benefits, and use different calculation algorithms when benefit amounts are entered.  It is in the best interest of the Government to continue services with the current contractor under the existing contract, increase the labor hours and extend the period of performance to ensure continuity of work.  This is not a request for proposal.

<DESC>s "Design Excellence" procedures, involving two selection phases.  The first phase involves a "short-listing" of qualified Lead Designers, chosen from those expressing interest in the project.  The second phase then considers short-listed Lead Designers and their integrated design teams.  Selection evaluation elements for both phases are identified herein.  Interested Lead Designers and design team members must be able to accept the statutory fee limitation, placed on all Government A/E procurements, capping all basic design fees to not exceed 6.0 percent of the project's Estimated Construction Costs.]

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Public Architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for major repairs and alterations to the historic J. W. McCormack Post Office and Courthouse in accordance with General Services Administration (GSA) quality standards and requirements.  The building is approximately 680,000 gross square feet, including 35 parking spaces, and located at 90 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is greater than Ten Million dollars.  The project will be designed in metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum:  metric construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), web-based project management services, and post construction contract services (PCCS) for an existing historical facility.  The project includes repair and alteration of an existing historical building, underground garage, and related systems; client program requirements for renovation of all tenant areas, restrooms and elevator lobbies; upgrading accessibility to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)/Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards(UFAS); structural upgrades for current seismic and wind load requirements; correction of codes deficiencies; abatement of hazardous materials (asbestos containing materials and lead paint); upgrading of elevators; renovation of main lobby; upgrading of plumbing, fire protection, mechanical and electrical systems, and security; and any other design work deemed necessary to implement the concepts developed during previous renovation studies as detailed in the Prospectus Development Study prepared by the Maguire Group Inc. in April 1996, or that may arise during the development of concept design.  The project shall encompass, to the extent practically and economically possible, all sound principles of sustainable design, including energy efficiency, good indoor air quality, use of recycled materials, and water conservation.  To the maximum extent practical, the building must also meet the U.S. Green Building Council?s LEEDTM certification criteria upon completion.  The building is also to include the GSA design standards for secure facilities.  This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting of this work.  The A/E firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility to conceive the design concept, including sustainable design approaches, and historical restoration strategy.  The A/E Firm must address the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and its ability to manage the design and production of construction documents.  In developing the project team, the A/E Firms are advised that at least 35% of the levelof contract effort must be performed in the Greater Boston area.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants.  The A/E selection will be completed in two phases as follows:  
For Phase I, interested firms will submit portfolios of previous work that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer, including their experience with sustainable design.  All documentation will be in an 8 1/2? x 11? format.  The portfolio should include the following:  a cover letter referencing the CBD announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; and Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) dated not more than twelve (12) months before the date of this synopsis, and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project).  Identification of consultants is not required at this phase.
Submission requirements and evaluation criteria:  (1) Past Performance on Design (35%): The A/E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) of not more than five new construction projects and projects with emphasis on historic, sustainable design and energy efficiency, and modernization experience, completed in the last ten years.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client?s program, functional, image, mission, economic, sustainability, schedule, historical sensitivity, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, phone, and fax numbers.  A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan and either a site plan or a building section;  (2) Philosophy and Design Intent (25%):  In the Lead Designer?s words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state his/her overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters that may apply in creating/restoring a state-of-the-art headquarters office building in an urban neighborhood environment;  (3) Lead Designer Profile (15%):  Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project;  (4) Lead Designer Portfolio (25%):  Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer?s ability to provide design excellence.

Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria (1), the Lead Designer will address his/her participation in the project.  An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of private-sector peers, and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions.  The Board will establish a short-list of three to six firms.
For Phase II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants.  The Phase II criteria shall be issued to the short-listed firms at that time.  The firms will be required to complete Standard Forms 254 and 255 that reflect the entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for interviews by the A/E Evaluation Board, along with the Phase I short-list announcement.  Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  The Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, possible approaches in carrying out the project, and project management.  Phase II rankings will be used in conjunction with Phase I rankings to determine the final selection.

<SOLNBR>DE-PS26-02NT41446
<CONTACT>Mary Gabriele, Contracting Officer, 304-285-4253, mgabri@netl.doe.gov;Dona Sheehan, Contract Specialist, 412-386-5918, sheehan@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>This solicitation supports the Natural Gas Infrastructure Reliability product line which is part of the Department of Energy?s Strategic Center for Natural Gas. This solicitation competitively seeks cost-shared applications for energy research and development (R&D) related activities that promote the efficient and sound production and use of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil). The primary purpose of the solicitation is to maintain and enhance the integrity and reliability of the natural gas transmission and distribution pipeline infrastructure.  Research directed specifically towards expansion of the pipeline and major references to expansion will be discouraged. In an effort to determine the needs of the gas infrastructure industry, NETL sponsored visioning and road mapping workshops allowing representatives from natural gas organizations and industries to define and prioritize research directions necessary to maintain and expand the natural gas infrastructure. The input from these workshops has been summarized in a report entitled ?Pathways for Enhanced Integrity, Reliability and Deliverability? and is publicly available on the NETL Website at http://www.netl.doe.gov/scng/publications/naturalg.pdf. Applicants are encouraged to review the information contained in this document. To support the pipeline infrastructure, NETL is requesting R&D applications which will result in the development of technology which supports the current and future natural gas infrastructure.  The solicitation will focus on research in the following areas: 1.) transmission systems, 2.) distribution systems and 3.) technologies which clearly affect both areas.  Applicants may propose research in any area which supports the industries needs; however, the proposed work must address, but not necessarily limited to, research needs identified in the visioning and road mapping workshops. In addition to the proposed R&D effort, applicants will be required to include a discussion of the costs and benefits to ensure that the technology being developed has the potential to result in a useful commercial product which will be utilized by the natural gas infrastructure industry. DATES: Potential applicants are required to submit a brief, not to exceed seven pages, pre-application.   The deadline for submissions of pre-applications and comprehensive applications will be identified in the solicitation.  No comprehensive application will be evaluated unless a pre-application has been received and considered by the DOE. The review process for the pre-applications will be limited to a programmatic review that will result in encouraging or discouraging submission of a comprehensive application.  However, discouraged applicants are not prohibited from submitting full applications.  A response to the pre-applications will be communicated to the applicant within two weeks after the closing date for the pre-application.  All pre-applications must be submitted through the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) system in accordance with the instructions in the solicitation.  The solicitation will be available on the "Industry Interactive Procurement System" (IIPS) webpage located at http://e-center.doe.gov on or about March 1, 2002.  The deadline for submission of pre-applications and comprehensive applications will be identified in the solicitation. Applicants can obtain access to the solicitation from the address above or through DOE/NETL?s website at http://www.netl.doe.gov/business.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>DE-PS26-02NT15373
<RESPDATE>043002
<ARCHDATE>05302002
<CONTACT>Richard Rogus, Contracting Officer, contact Keith Miles, see phone number, rogus@netl.doe.gov;Keith Miles, Contract Specialist, 412-386-5984, miles@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), on behalf of its National Petroleum Technology Office (NPTO), is soliciting applications for cost-shared research projects that address specific air quality or produced water management issues faced by the oil and gas industry. The goal is to provide solutions to issues that are limiting domestic on-shore or off-shore production while providing the same or higher levels of environmental protection. The mission of the Department of Energy's Fossil Energy Oil Program is derived from the National need for increased oil production for national security, requirements for Federal Lands stewardship,  and increased protection of the environment.   The Oil and Gas Environmental Program supports those goals and the National Energy Policy goal of increasing domestic oil and gas production, by providing technologies and approaches that reduce the cost of effective environmental protection and by providing technologies and approaches that improve environmental protection.The two areas of interest for this solicitation are: 1) Air Quality This area of interest is directed toward providing better tools to meet existing requirements as well as providing a more accurate assessment of the impacts of oil and gas activities on regional air quality.  Applications in this area should address emissions control technologies for oil and gas E&P activities or address monitoring  and modeling improvements that will provide more accurate assessments and predictions of the impacts of both current and future oil and gas activities on regional air quality.  Applications in this area of interest should clearly demonstrate that the results of the project meet current legal and regulatory requirements or that the results will support the development of future requirements and appropriate government agencies are involved with the project and support the project goals. 2) Produced Water This area of interest is directed toward reducing the cost of produced water management.  Applications in this area should address lower cost treatment processes, economic beneficial use of produced water, or best management practices that reduce the overall cost of produced water handling.  All applications should clearly describe how a successful project will result in cost savings to operators and the magnitude of those savings. Applications addressing beneficial use of produced water may address treatment technologies designed to meet certain use criteria or may address ecological and/or regulatory concerns that limit producers' options for managing produced water. If implementation of the results of the project  are dependent upon approval or concurrence of one or more regulatory agencies, applications should clearly demonstrate that such agencies are appropriately involved with the project and support the project goals. The goal of this solicitation is to provide solutions to issues that are limiting domestic on-shore or off-shore production while providing the same or higher levels of environmental protection.  These air quality and produced water management issues are limiting domestic production by restricting additional development or by adding costs that cause operators to abandon existing wells while substantial recoverable resources remain in the ground. The issues listed above are multi-faceted problems.  In many cases, the overall solution may vary by region or may require several separate steps to resolve completely.  Selected projects are expected to describe the overall problem and the region or regions affected as well as describing how the proposed project fits into the overall solution.  Selected projects are also expected to describe as completely as possible the impact that the project will have on increasing or maintaining domestic production.  The description of the production impact should discuss in detail the resource affected and the amount of domestic production that canbe added or maintained as a result of the successful completion of the project. DOE anticipates awarding approximately three (3) to seven (7) financial assistance (i.e., Cooperative Agreements) with a project performance period no less than one year in length and up to three years in length. Approximately $7.0 million of DOE funding is planned over a 3-year period for this solicitation.  DOE has determined the minimum cost share of twenty percent (20%) of the total estimated project cost is required; details of the cost sharing requirement and the specific funding levels will be contained in the program solicitation. This solicitation will be targeted for unrestricted competition.  However, applications submitted by or on behalf of 1) another Federal agency; 2) a Federally Funded Research and Development Center sponsored by another Federal agency; or 3) a Department of Energy (DOE) Management Operating (M&O) contractor will not be eligible for award under this solicitation. However, an application that includes performance of a portion of the work by a DOE M&O contractor will be evaluated and may be considered for award subject to the provisions to be set forth in Program Solicitation DE-PS26-02NT15373. (NOTE: The limit on participation by an M&O contractor for an individual project under this solicitation cannot exceed 25% of the total project cost). Once released, the solicitation will be available for downloading from the IIPS Internet page.  At this Internet site you will also be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to submit an application. If you need technical assistance in registering or for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or E-mail the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov. The solicitation will only be made available in IIPS, no hard (paper) copies of the solicitation and related documents will be made available.

MUNITIONS FOR LOW COLLATERAL DAMAGE APPLICATIONS
The Ordnance Integration Branch (MNMI) is interested in a concept definition/exploration study of munitions technologies for use in Low Collateral Damage (LCD) applications.  These munitions concepts should consider light to medium armored military targets placed in an urban setting, while minimizing collateral damage to the surrounding civilian assets.  These technologies may be applied to munitions under development as well as to system designs in current operation.  Areas of particular interest are warhead cases (i.e. design, materials), weapon airframes, weapon payloads/kill mechanisms, fuzing, and integration of such components.

Proposer Information Pamphlet

1.0 PROPOSER INFORMATION
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) often solicits research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  The BAA is in the Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPPS), a Web-site (http://www.eps.gov/) sponsored by the General Services Administration (GSA).  This Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) is for parties interested in responding to the BAA.  It presents the research objectives, scope, procurement description, recommended elements of proposal response, and procurement schedule and procedures.
	 
It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  The Government evaluation team will consist of Government personnel from DARPA and other Government agencies.  For this solicitation, non-government advisors from Booz/Allen Hamilton (BAH) who have signed appropriate non-disclosure and conflict of interest statements may assist in the proposal administration and review process when their particular expertise is required; however, they will not participate in the final source selection process.

2.0 BACKGROUND
Underground facilities (UGFs) are a serious and growing asymmetric threat to our security and operational dominance.  The DARPA program is focused on characterization of UGFs.  The initial focus has been on theater-level, strategic facilities, which have significant electrically powered equipment (example: central command and control facilities).  Recent events show the importance of also being able to characterize tunnels and caves with primitive infrastructure.  UGF defeat using conventional standoff weapons or ground attack requires substantial characterization including knowledge of facility function and significance, location and temporal availability of critical vulnerabilities for targeting, and battle damage assessment (BDA).  Characterization for targeting is very demanding: What is the priority?  Where are the aimpoints? When to strike?  Strike again?  

This PIP is directed at development and initial evaluation of innovative methods and/or designs for detection and exploitation of UGF-related observables ranging from the tactical use of caves to strategic-level UGFs.  Areas of interest include novel sensors; sensor system planning, deployment, and communications; and modeling, exploitation algorithms and signal processing.  

As background, BAA 02-04 solicits responses in two discrete work areas.  This work area, addressing innovative methods and technologies, is Work Area 2.  Work Area 1 addresses the development and demonstration of a functional (non-form factored) prototype ground sensor system.  For offerors submitting an unclassified proposal or white paper for the work area addressed herein (Work Area 2), this unclassified PIP is sufficient.  A classified PIP is available to offerors meeting security requirements and intending to submit a classified white paper or proposal under Work Area 2.  These offerors should request the classified PIP in accordance with the procedures identified in the FEDBIZOPPS SOL BAA 02-04 which may be found on the BAA Web site http://www.darpa.mil/spo/solicitations.htm.  


3.0 Objectives, Approach and Scope	

The goal is to identify innovative CUGF technologies, methods or techniques that offer potential performance improvements for sensor systems, their deployment, emplacement and/or operation.  Potential innovations include, but are not limited to: exploitation of novel observables or new applications of currently-exploited observables; improved deployable sensors; new techniques for sensor system planning and deployment; improved communications in rugged terrain; new methods for sensor and system modeling; and exploitation algorithms and signal processing. 

Areas of interest also includes new methods for characterizing activity associated with minimum infrastructure tunnels and caves.  Concepts may include technologies for identifying the presence of humans or level of activity within or at the entrance to a tunnel or cave, tagging techniques for monitoring personnel-level activity into and out of such a facility, and support to ground attack such as exterior-based detection of personnel movement inside a cave or tunnel. 

4.0 Program Structure, Proposal Content, Formal Schedule, and Submission

4.1 Program Structure
Responses will be accepted up to 24 months from the date of publication of this BAA.  Either abbreviated proposals or white papers may be submitted (see Section 5.2).  DARPA recognizes that proposed work may be immature and may not have been significantly evaluated in the context of the UGF application.  DARPA may make modest investments in such areas prior to a commitment to system integration and demonstration.  Individual awards are generally expected to be less than $1M.  

4.2 Proposal/White Paper Content  
Submissions must provide a brief description of the performance gap or capability being addressed, a top-level description of the concept, an explanation of how the identified innovation differs from other concepts and why it is an improvement over the SOA devices or concepts, the physical principles supporting the concept, and if possible, rule-of-thumb modeling indicative of the potential success and value.  Full proposals will be requested from offerors whose white papers show promise for innovative technical solutions. DARPA may select from among full proposals submitted and fund proposed individual tasks. Initial efforts that subsequently demonstrate promise for CUGF applications may be funded for additional related work by the same performer to mature the concept for inclusion into a system for demonstration.  Submissions under this unclassified PIP should reference Work Area 2 on the title page in order to be readily categorized with innovative technology proposals submitted using the classified PIP.  
 

5.0 PROCUREMENT SCHEDULE AND PROCEDURES

5.1 Procurement Schedule
Immediate submission of white papers is encouraged.  There is no predetermined schedule for granting awards for this work area. White papers or proposals may be submitted any time after publication of the BAA.  Proposals can be reviewed and selected for award any time after publication of the BAA. This portion of the BAA will be left open for 24 months after publication, and white papers and proposals will be accepted and considered throughout the full 24 months.  Unclassified white papers and proposals should be mailed to DARPA, 3701 N. Fairfax, Drive, Arlington, VA 22203, ATTN: Dr. Dan Cress/BAA 02-04/Document Control.  

5.2 Proposal/White Paper Format
White Paper submissions are recommended.  They should be short (i.e., 3 pages or less of technical content) and address the content described in Section 4.2.2.   A first-level cost estimate for the full effort should be provided. 

Proposals shall comprise separate technical and cost sections.  The technical section shall not exceed 10 pages and contain:  
	Body: notional concept and the performance gap it addresses, SOA description and projected performance improvement over SOA, and a statement of work (SOW) 
	Schedule/Milestones
	List of Deliverables
	Brief Qualifications of Key Personnel (not included in page count)
	Security Plan (if required not included in page count) 

The technical section shall be strictly limited to a maximum of 10 pages, not including the title page, table of contents, qualifications of principal investigators and key personnel and security plan (if required).  Both the technical and cost sections shall be on single-sided, double-spaced pages; page size not larger that 8 1/2X11 inches; font to be not smaller than 12 point; one inch left/right margins, 1.25 inch top margin, 0.5 inch bottom margin on all sheets.

Each cost proposal shall contain a section addressing the following: awards made under this initiative are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in this section.
Only those offerors whose proposal is expected to result in contract award will be required to submit a completed and signed copy of Representations, Certifications, and other Statements by Offerors or Respondents.  This document is not required for the submission of a proposal unless specifically requested. Offerors are notified that this document is frequently updated and any offeror selected for award may be requested to submit an updated Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements by Offerors or Respondents.

5.3 Evaluation Criteria and Funding Processes
 For evaluation purposes, a proposal is comprised of the Technical and Cost sections described in the Proposal Format Section.  Where an oral presentation is given, the proposal as defined for evaluation refers to the combined written and oral responses.  Other supporting or background materials submitted with the proposal will be examined at the reviewer's convenience and not considered as part of the proposal.  

Each offeror's proposal will be evaluated for overall merit.  The evaluation of the Technical Section ranks as the highest priority, and will be based on the following criteria:
a.	Innovative and creative technical approaches.  Innovativeness and creativity of the offeror's proposed technical approach.  In particular, the following items will be considered: innovation and technical merit of proposed approach, soundness of proposed work, probability of success, and advances in the state-of-the-art.
b.	Understanding of the technical issues and risks.  Proposals will be evaluated for the applicability of technologies identified and a preliminary risk analysis of the efforts associated with execution.  In particular, evaluations will be based upon the offeror's understanding and knowledge as determined by the proposed technology and its maturity, risks involved and risk avoidance, and trade-off studies.
c.	Soundness of technical and management approach, including teaming.  Evaluation of the offeror's proposed Program Plan and the likelihood that it will meet or exceed the CUGF program goals and objectives as defined in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  Also, evaluation of the teaming arrangement and the probability that the team will result in enhanced contract performance.
d.	Offeror's relevant experience, facilities, and availability of qualified experienced technical personnel, in addition to experience in areas such as signal prediction, signal processing, and ground sensors.  The capabilities of the offeror to perform the stated work will be examined.  In particular, the qualifications of principal investigators will be considered.  The range, depth, and mix of expertise of the offeror's key personnel (and those of other team members, if appropriate) will be evaluated to ensure that they are qualified in the theory and application of the technologies involved in the research and development related to the CUGF program. 
e.	Organization, clarity, and thoroughness of proposal.  Proposals will be evaluated on readability.  This includes flow, organization, clarity and thoroughness.
The Cost proposal will be assessed to determine whether the offeror's estimate is reasonable and realistic for the technical and management approach offered, as well as to determine the offeror's practical understanding of the effort.  Cost reasonableness assessment will be based upon the number of labor-hours and labor mix proposed as well as the reasonableness of other cost elements (e.g. travel, materials, subcontractors, etc.)  Cost realism will only be assessed if there is reason to believe that offerors have significantly under- or over-estimated costs to complete the effort.

All awards will be subject to availability of government funds.  Awards will be made to those offerors whose proposals are considered most advantageous to the government.  The government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or an Other Transaction Agreement depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors.  No portion of the BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) or minority institutions (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete severable areas of research for exclusive competition among the entries.

Based upon proposals received, DARPA may wish to negotiate options for follow-on technology development into resultant awards.  Offerors who believe their technology solutions may afford opportunities for additional investigation or further development may wish to submit an option proposal along with their proposal for the basic effort envisioned within this Initiative.  However, any optional tasks must be described in a separate technical and cost document that will not be considered in the evaluation of the requested proposal.


5.4 Proposal/White Paper Security
The proposals submitted under this should be unclassified.  Those anticipating classified proposals should request the classified PIP.  Offerors may obtain a classified Compact Disk (CD) containing the classified PIP by faxing their facility clearance level, Defense Security Services CAGE code and classified mailing address to Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), fax number (703) 524-2449 (Attn: Ms. Mary Thomson/BAA 02-04).  Please identify the specific information being requested and the name and telephone number of the requester.  
 
6.0 REQUIREMENTS, REPORTS, AND DELIVERABLES

6.1 Fixed Schedule Reporting
The performer will provide quarterly progress reports documenting   progress, coordination activities, and cost.   Total planned and actual costs will be presented in monthly increments in the quarterly reports.  

6.2 Milestone-Driven Reporting
In addition to the fixed schedule reporting, performers should clearly define additional reporting activities associated with key milestones defined in their proposed effort.

6.3 Communications
Since this work area (innovative methods and technologies)  will be open for 24 months, there will not be a structured question and answer mechanism.  However, unclassified questions regarding this work area may be sent via the BAA email address:
 baa02-04@darpa.mil.  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  will be updated as appropriate and posted on the BAA Website under the category Work Area 2.

6.4 Ownership of Products
The U.S. Government wishes to retain, at a minimum, Government Purpose Rights to all output from this effort, including software.  The actual rights negotiated will depend on the type of award instrument, the type of awardee, and the nature of the technology.  The Government may choose to disseminate some of the results publicly and may discuss them at conferences and at other public and private meetings under appropriate security constraints.  They may form the basis for subsequent BAA, Research Announcement (RAs), or other solicitations from DARPA or other Government organizations.

Govworks intends to issue a contract.  BACKGROUND:  The Department of State is committed to the creation of the United States Diplomacy Center (USDC) within the Department of State building with both private and public funds.  The Center will bring American diplomacy and its practitioners to life for the public as it explores the history, function and challenges of diplomacy.  With interactive exhibits, briefing space, multimedia stations and cutting edge technologies and techniques, the Center will engage visitors in understanding how diplomacy affects all our lives and how ordinary citizens, as well as  professionals, contribute to its formulation and execution. To fulfill this vision, the Department is partially providing renovated space, staff and security for the new Center.  Space has been allocated for the Diplomacy Center next to the 21st street entrance.  Museum designer Ralph Appelbaum is designing the interior of the Diplomacy Center. The Department of State will need to raise funds from private donors, possibly as much as $60 million, to build the Center.  An additional amount will be needed to provide the Center with an endowment for maintaining and replacing exhibits and carrying out special projects and programs.  The Department needs to know the scope and feasibility of launching a capital campaign.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The Department seeks to contract with a development firm to prepare and conduct a study to determine the scope and feasibility of launching a capital campaign to build the U.S. Diplomacy Center.

<DESC>The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend the United States and its deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack.  As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capability or improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats.  To investigate these new technologies, MDA has established a Deputy for Advanced Concepts (AC) whose mission is to pursue and assess innovative concepts and develop algorithms to improve BMDS capability.  MDA/AC has established an Innovation Cell, which consists of a team of experts to evaluate new ballistic missile defense concepts and technologies.  

The MDA/AC Innovation Cell seeks new and innovative concepts for integrated systems and for technical improvements in the boost, midcourse, and terminal phases of missile defense.  Specific research objectives for each missile defense phase encompass Surveillance, Track & Discrimination, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, and Kill Assessment.  Concepts are sought in the following seven technology areas: (1) Radar Systems, including Integrated System Concepts, Cross Sections and Signatures, Measurements (waveforms, data extraction), Hardware (transmit/receive modules), Signal Processing, Data Visualization, Data Compression, Image Interpretation, Seekers; (2) Lasers and Electro-Optical Systems, including High Energy Lasers, Beam Control, Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar Systems, Optical Signal Processing, Focal Plane Arrays, Lethality Mechanisms; (3) Mathematics and Computer Science, including Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Software, Probability and Statistics, and Pattern Recognition; (4) Electrical Engineering, including Digital Electronics and Signal Processing, Machine Implementation of Algorithms, Analog Circuits and Communications, Computer Vision, Distributed Computing; (5) Physics and Chemistry, including Electrodynamics, Nuclear Physics and Weapons Effects, Infrared and Optical Signatures, Energy Conversion, and Rocket Plume Analysis; (6) Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, including Space Systems, Missile System Aerodynamics, Propulsion, and Reentry Physics, Guidance and Control, and Materials Science; and (7) Battle Management/Command and Control, including Engagement Planning, Tactics, Intelligence Exploitation, and Countermeasures, Decision Theory and Modeling, Target Tracking, Classification, Identification, and Discrimination, and Sensor Fusion.

If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary concept paper (up to five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA program; (2) a Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities.  Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .pdf file) to the point of contact listed below.	
MDA will evaluate these responses based upon the following criteria (all criteria of equal importance): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and the level of risk; (2) the scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; (3) the offer's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (the ROCM). 
	
This BAA will remain open until September 30, 2003. Responses will be evaluated as received, but may take up to six months to complete.  If MDA decides to pursue a concept, a formal proposal will be requested.  

The MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA.  Any awards are anticipated to occur in FYs 2002 -- 2004, and will most likely be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type of arrangement.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received.  The point of contact for concept submittals and questions is Albert Dainton at (703) 695-9174 or email at albert.dainton-contractor@mda.osd.mil.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is seeking to identify qualified 8A and small businesses capable of providing cafeteria services for its main campus in Atlanta, Georgia.  The CDC is recognized as the lead federal agency for protecting the health and safety of people - at home and abroad, providing credible information to enhance health decisions, and promoting health through strong partnerships. CDC serves as the national focus for developing and applying disease prevention and control, environmental health, and health promotion and education activities designed to improve the health of the people of the United States.  The CDC is an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. There are approximately 5,635 government employees and 2,426 contractor employees throughout the Atlanta area in three government owned facilities (campuses) and twenty-five leased buildings in several office parks.  The main Roybal campus is located at 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30333.  Currently, approximately 2,650 individuals are housed at the Roybal Campus. The Roybal Campus presently has a full service cafeteria located in Building 16 with a seating capacity of 175.  The cafeteria serves approximately 1,000 customers per day.  Approximately half of these customers purchase food on a "take-out" basis.  CDC's Facility Master Plan calls for the construction of several laboratory and office buildings at this campus and others in the next 10 years.  The new construction will more than double the number of staff residing at the Roybal Campus and preliminary plans include at least one additional full service cafeteria and possibly several cafes located in satellite buildings on the campus.  Based on CDC's Facility Master Plan, it is anticipated that cafeteria services, including catering services, will increase due to construction of new buildings on the other campuses as well as the Roybal Campus.  CDC does not anticipate awarding a requirements-type contract.  The initial contract will require the purchase of food and supplies, and the preparation and serving of breakfast and lunch to approximately 1,000 customers daily at the Roybal Campus location.  The initial contract will also include periodic special catering services at CDC sponsored functions such as breakfast or luncheon meetings, conferences, symposia, after-hour support or emergency food service needs.  In addition, the initial contract requirements will include cleaning of the facilities, maintaining quality control, pest control, and maintenance of Government-furnished equipment. CDC is interested in industry input on current industry practices (best practices and lessons learned) related to food security, level of personnel security screening, personnel qualifications, performance incentives, and delivery of food service strategies to enhance consumer satisfaction.   Please submit in Word, WordPerfect, or Excel to the address below (e-mail is acceptable) an expression of your firm's interest in the area of food services provision as described above, a brief description of your firm's capabilities related to these services including up to five current customers, and feedback on any or all of the questions posed below.  We ask that you submit nonproprietary information only in response to this RFI.  It would be appreciated if responses were put in a format directly related to the questions, which are sequentially numbered. 1. Based on your experience providing similar services to those described above in either the Federal Government or private sector, what types of contracts (fixed price, award fee, cost plus, etc.) have you worked under and what were the advantages/disadvantages of each type? 2. In addition to providing traditional cafeteria services, describe any methods you have used to provide food services to customers outside of the cafeteria for special events such as meetings or conferences (catering, etc.), to include the methods by which you meet those requirements; e.g., whether you subcontract with other food services; etc. 3. Describe the methods you use under your Federal Government and/or private sector contracts that enable you to provide high quality, wholesome, nutritious, and safe food at economical prices (revenue-sharing, cost-sharing, subsidies, partnerships, etc.). 4. What experience have you had providing increased levels of food, employee, and supplier security (additional employee security screening over and above NACI background checks, dealing with certified "secure" food providers, etc.)?   What are the advantages and disadvantages of these practices?  5. CDC anticipates that this contract will be a Performance-Based contract.  Describe your experience providing cafeteria services under a Performance-Based services contract.  What are some best practices and lessons learned information that you can offer? 6. Given the nature of CDC's efforts, what evaluation factors do you believe would enable the Government to differentiate between vendors?  What do you see as key discriminators (i.e., where do you believe the value added is in this type contract and how do you believe it is best measured)? 7. Provide any additional information that would be helpful to the CDC in crafting the procurement documents for this contract. CDC anticipates a five-year contract; a basic period of performance with four, one-year option periods of performance if exercised by the government.  Additional information about CDC is available on the Internet and the following Internet site is provided to assist you in learning more about the CDC: http://www.cdc.gov. Interested parties may send their capabilities, including a list of not more than 5 current customers for whom you perform similar requirements, the responses to the questions listed above, and a point of contact with phone number to: Deborah S. Fallick or Sandra A. Baxley, 2920 Brandywine Road, Suite 3000, Atlanta, Georgia  30341; e-mail: dsf2@cdc.gov or svb1@cdc.gov. THIS REQUEST IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND IS CONSIDERED TO BE MARKET RESEARCH; it does not constitute a proposal and does not obligate the CDC in any way. Responses are requested no later than 7 business days from the issue date of this RFI.

<ARCHDATE>04282002
<CONTACT>Stanley Sokolowski, 732 427 2704
<DESC>NA This is a Market Survey to locate sources of supply for a Dead Reckoning Device (DRD) to be used in the Land Warrior Version 1.0.  The Land Warrior is an integrated system used by the dismounted combat soldier at the tactical level.  Land Warrior facilitat es the dynamic flow of battlefield information and actively supports soldier level integration into the digitized battlefield.  The Land Warrior System includes a Navigation Subsystem (NAVSS) that integrates Global Positioning System (GPS) and a DRD.  The Land Warrior program is scheduled to begin full rate production in FY04.   Currently the NAVSS GPS is Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and the DRD is Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE).  Potential sources of supply must be able to deliver production units in FY03 that are capable of providing a backup positioning capability  to the GPS when the GPS signals are unavailable through the use of heading and distance traveled computation.  Typical performance in the backup dead reckoning mode is 2-5% of distance traveled under normal walking conditions.  Suppliers capable of furnishing these units must so indicate by writing to:  Commander, CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-RD-C2-PMSM (S. Sokolowski), Building 2705, Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey 07703-5000.  The response must include documentation such as performance test res ults, information to show that the suppliers possesses, or shall posses, adequate production plant facilities (equipment, tooling, and space) to enable them, or thier subcontractors, to produce this item and projected cost data for quantity buys of 100, 10 00 and 4000 systems. All technical questions should be addressed to S. Sokolowski, (732) 427-2704, email address Stanley.sokolowski@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  RFI regarding replacement of the RL-293/M Antenna Tensioner/Reeling Machine for the E-6 aircraft.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst (NAWCADLKE) is considering the possibility of procuring Antenna Tensioners/Reeling Machines (AT/RM) as support equipment (SE) for the C3 E-6 aircraft, utilizing non-developmental item (NDI) and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) parts to the maximum extent possible. NAWCADLKE is the cognizant field activity (CFA) involving SE for PMA-271.  The RL-293/M is currently being used at the organizational maintenance level (O-level), and is the only method to remove and replace (R/R) the antenna wires installed on the E-6 aircraft.  The loss of this peculiar support equipment (PSE) item prohibits mission accomplishment.  The E-6 Program has a requirement for six reeling machines to support the Main Operating Base (MOB), Forward Operating Base (FOB), and a training asset, which are documented in the Individual Material Readiness Lists (IMRLs).  The antenna wires vary from 4,800 to 28,500 feet in length.  The RL-293/M has been in service for 30 years and a replacement is required due to escalating obsolescence.  The RL-293/M current bill of materials includes 63 high-risk components for which no spare/repair parts exist and are non-procurable.  Another 640 non-spared parts are considered medium risk because they will require engineering efforts to identify substitute/alternate parts and alternate sources upon failure.  Supportability of the current RL-293/M presents a significant readiness deficiency and is a cost driver to the future of E-6 Program.  The following information is requested regarding the AT/RM:  principles of operation, design criteria and concepts (including drives, platform, wire management, controls and operator interface), applicable power source candidates, and maintenance (logistic) requirements.  Other information to be provided shall include weights, dimensions, power (HP/KW), speeds (wire velocity-feet per minute), and manufacturing/construction time. Also provide a discussion concerning an overall performance goal, including supportability, exceeding that of the current AT/RM SE (RL-293/M).  It is requested that the information be submitted NO LATER THAN 21 MARCH 2002 to Mr. Joseph Bolmarcich, NAWCADLKE (Code 2.5.2.2), Building 562, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733, who may be reached at (732) 323-2533.  Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation MAY NOT necessarily result from this RFI.  Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in the response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<SUBJECT>R -- COMPILE DATA RELATED TO WORKPLACE VIOLENCE AGAINST HEALTH CARE WORKERS
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.     The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), will be conducting a NORA-funded feasibility research study to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for reducing the risk of violence to nurses, nursing aides, orderlies, and attendants in health care settings.   The purpose of this initial requirement is to obtain  data from healthcare facilities with regard to workplace violence prevention strategies in place and the assault experience of health care workers in those facilities.  Contractor will gather data on existing policies and procedures regarding workplace violence as well as records on incidents and assaults to potentially include first reports of injury, workers compensation reports, security incident logs or records, OSHA logs or other sources of information.  Contractor will also conduct ongoing surveillance of assaults in the enrolled facilities and provide feedback to NIOSH on potential survey design and methods.  The project is estimated to take a year and a  half to collect data.   CDC/NIOSH intends to partner with Seattle King County Health Department (SKCHD), Seattle, WA on a non-competitive basis.  SKCHD is considered uniquely qualified to meet the requirements under this procurement because of their established relationship as a trusted liason with all of the health care facilities in Seattle and King County.  The previous interactions of SKCHD with the local health care facilities provides an opportunity for effectively assessing data that may not otherwise be readily available.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations.   Organizations may respond within 15 days after publication of  this notice and  demonstrate that they have the expertise and capabilities necessary  to meet the stated requirements.  Forward information to :  Brenda L. Goodwin, Reference:  2002-Q-00369, DHHS, PHS, CDC,  NIOSH, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.  Information received will generally be for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This notice is  issued for informational purposes.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Separation of Branched Versus Linear Polar Organic Molecules - Technology Transfer Opportunity
<DESC>Separation of Branched Versus Linear Polar Organic Molecules - Technology Transfer Opportunity 

Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico has developed a new class of material (SD-7041) that can perform a variety of molecular separations in bulk liquids. The separations are 100% reversible and may performed at room temperature with zero to low amounts of added energy, depending on the separation. This is possible because when the material is removed from the bulk liquid mixture, the sorbed molecules will desorb either spontaneously or with heating at less than 50 oC, often within minutes.  The separated species may therefore easily be condensed and recovered in the liquid phase for use, re-use, or disposal. The material has been shown to selectively sorb from bulk liquid mixtures: linear alcohols from branched alcohols; short chain alcohols from long chain alcohols; alcohols from water. The material has also proved an effective (reversible) sorbent for tetrahydrofuran (THF), amines, and cyclohexane.  This new class of material may have application in petro-chemical industrial manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and industrial effluent stream remediation. For further information, please respond by mail or fax to Alane Dulski no later than March 13, 2002, at:  Sandia National Laboratories, MS 1380, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185-1380, Fax: (505) 843-4163.  Please indicate the date and title of this Federal Business Opportunities notice in your response.
