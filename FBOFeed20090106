<DESC>Frequency:
Background:  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auctioned the frequency spectrum previously used by the AGM-130/GBU-15 Weapons System during training operations.  As a result, the AGM-130/GBU-15 Data Link Sub-System (Weapon Data Links (WDL). Switchable Data Links (SDL), AXQ-14 Pods, ZSW-1 Pods, and all associated test sets and support equipment must be modified to operate in the new frequencies approved for CONUS training use by the Nation Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).  Raytheon Indianapolis is the OEM for the WDL, SDL, AXQ-14 & ZSW-1 Pods and associated test sets.  Raytheon will modify the Data Link Sub-System to operate in the new CONUS-training frequencies while continuing to operate in the current training /operational frequencies.  BAE is the OEM for the AN/GJM-65 Advanced support Equipment (ASE) weapon tester.  BAE will modify the ASE to test WDL/SDLs in the two new CONUS frequencies while maintaining the capability to test in the operational frequencies and current training frequencies (OCONUS).  

Description of Requirement:  The third component to Frequency Relocation is the F-15E aircraft integration to support interface with the AXQ-14 Pod, ZSW-1 Pod, WDL/SDLs, 1810-109 tester and the ASE tester.  The AGM-130 Program Office requires design review support for each of the components and testers being modified.  In addition, the following ICD?s must be modified, GBU-15, AGM-130, AXQ-14 and the ZSW-1.  Technical orders will be reviewed and updated to accommodate the changes.  System verification support is required in order to prepare test plans & procedures to support aircraft integration and flight test.  

Sustainment:

Description of Requirement:  Services provided will consist of three major task areas.  These are:  1) Depot service, calibration and repair of selected GBU-15 and AGM-130 module assemblies;  2) Selected engineering Technical services on an approved as required basis;  3) Refurbishment of improved depot factory test equipment.

Total Contract Estimate:  $15M

<SUBJECT>Capacity-building activities in Latin America and the Caribbean Basin.
<SOLNBR>FDA-2009-GMI 
<RESPDATE>012309
<CONTACT>Lee Cohen, Associate Director, OAGS, Email lee.cohen@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Regional Health-Care Training Center, Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies (GMI), Panam City, Republic of Panam for services, facilities and evaluation reports on capacity-building activities in Latin America and the Caribbean Basin.

The FDA requires a single source capable of hosting, within a single, centralized, well-equipped Latin American location, capacity-building seminars and workshops, and evaluation reports of those and other training activities, related to HHS/FDA expertise in the regulation of foods, drugs, animal feed and medical devices.  HHS/FDA requires that the entity be widely reputed among Latin American and Caribbean Basin government, academic, and private circles as being of independent judgment, scientifically sound, and capable of culturally adapting HHS/FDA regulatory curricula and training to local economies within Latin America and the Caribbean Basin.  HHS/FDA also requires that the entity have strong relationships with the national Health Ministries of the countries of the region, and the ability to perform rigorous evaluations of training activities.  The source will have existing experience with regulatory issues of a public health nature that will permit it to tailor presentations to local conditions, and in the Spanish and Portuguese languages.  Specific tasks include the following:

Using pre-existing contacts and relationships, the source will be expected to recruit knowledgeable, independent, and experienced regulatory experts to work with HHS/FDA experts to develop curricula for a series of public-health workshops and seminars related FDA-regulated products exported to the United States.
Using pre-existing contacts and relationships, the source will be expected to recruit participants for the seminars and workshops who are in Governmental, academic, and industry positions to apply the information learned to take regulatory, manufacturing, or other actions to improve compliance of HHS/FDA-regulated products with HHS/FDA requirements.

Strengthening HHS/FDAs resources and expertise in capacity-building in Latin America and the Caribbean basin, by providing formal assessments to improve the effectiveness and reach of HHS/FDA training activities.

Providing conference facilities in an easily accessed, centralized location that can handle up to 50 participants for week-long events in which participants will have constant access to computers and other electronic teaching methods for the duration of the seminar.
Providing presentation, audio, and related conference services for facilitation of the events.
Providing culturally appropriate translation and interpretation services for participants, including Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking participants.

GMI is the only entity that has the facilities, the central location, the established scientific, academic, and regulatory reputation for excellence and independence, and the staff to perform these services.

As part of the Panamanian Ministry of Health, GMI has a unique set of relationships with institutions across the region, especially units of other national Governments; this affiliation is critical for assembling and evaluating effective capacity-building activities on behalf of HHS/FDA in Latin America and the Caribbean Basin.  GMI has workers that include trainers, physicians, scientists, technical staff and administrative staff.  GMI scientific and technical expertise resides in its excellent professional staff members including Ph.D.s, and M.D.s including veterinary physicians with Ph.Ds, and many technicians with Masters degrees in science.  GMI has a specialist in geo-reference, and a group trained in the field isolation of dangerous organisms from animal tissues. 

GMI has well-established laboratories of virology, parasitology, immunology, genomics, entomology and food and water chemistry.  GMI is the national Public Health Laboratory of Panam, and this makes it the national reference laboratory for malaria, tuberculosis and all viral and bacterial diseases; GMI is also a regional reference laboratory for several pathogens.  GMI  has departments of epidemiology and biostatistics, chronic-disease studies, health policy, and health and human-reproduction studies.  In addition to all these areas of expertise, GMI is also the locus of the Panamanian national committee on human-subjects protection (National Institutional Review Board).  A new BLS-3 laboratory currently under construction, along with the expansion and improvement of existing laboratory space, is part of a modernization plan that will significantly enhance the capability of GMI laboratories to provide training in the role that laboratory services play in the regulation of foods and drugs and the delivery of community health care.

The unique geographic characteristics of Panama and its transportation (air, sea and land) infrastructure make it an extremely central and accessible location for people from Central and South America and the Caribbean who would attend for training.

GMI also has a unique, formalized relationship with HHS that reflects the cooperation between the two organizations that is deeper and more varied than with any other organization in Latin America or the Caribbean Basin.  In April 2006, HHS and the Gorgas Memorial Institute concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that provides for joint projects  to improve our preparedness for and response to infectious disease, with particular regard to influenza and other respiratory diseases.  Projects could take the form of joint meetings, conferences, training, exchanges of scientists and public health experts.

In October 2007, the Governments of Republic of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panam, and the United States of America, created the RHCTC at GMI through an MoU.  That MOU provided the RHCTC would work, among other things, to do the following:

to serve as a resource for training to build individual and collective capacity to improve the health and health care of the populations of the Participating Countries and better monitor, respond to, and prevent  potential, critical infectious-disease threats, actual and potential;
improve the skills and abilities of health-care workers to provide basic health care, including preventive care, to populations at-risk and/or in need, with an initial emphasis on situations related to infectious and respiratory diseases, including potential emerging threats; 
to work collectively to enhance the public health expertise of health-care workers from the Participating Countries,, through an increased knowledge base and competency about the similarities and difference of populations and their health-risks, including cultural barriers to access and delivery of care; and to facilitate the international exchange of information and expertise on surveillance, prevention and control of, and research on, communicable and non-communicable diseases; and detection and response


The NAICS code is 928120.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes; no solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted.  However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capability to perform these services, which will be considered by the Agency.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   A solicitation will be issued to GMI no less than 15 days after the date of this notice unless the Government determines that any other organization has the capability to meet this requirement.  All inquiries must be received by 10:00 AM (1000) EST on 23 January 2008 to the attention of Lee Cohen, lee.cohen@fda.hhs.gov.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The Behavioral and Rehabilitation Technology Branch, National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the Agenzia Regionale Sanita of the Regione Toscana, a component of the Regional Health Authority of Tuscany in Italy. The purpose of the contract is to create a rehabilitation research data resource entitled Community Assessment Rehabilitation Experiment (CARE). A pilot study to examine adaptive physical activity was initiated by the Istituto Superiore di Sanita as part of the research project "Obtaining Optimal Functional Recovery and Efficient Managed Care for the Chronic Stroke Population" within the framework of the 2003 Memorandum of Understanding between the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services and Italy's Ministry of Health. The study included a community intervention program that was initiated in the Tuscan Region by Dr. Francesco Benvenuti and Dr. Laura Tramonti. The program's impact included safety of the intervention, improvement of gait and balance function and reduction in participants' depression. Community access remains a key issue in translating research results of individuals with chronic conditions who have participated in an exercise regime. The pilot provided an important step in translating the growing evidence regarding the health benefits of exercise for stroke survivors into a sustainable community model that was safe, feasible and efficacious in improving walking speed, and community ambulation. The intervention program demonstrated it has the potential to improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs associated with chronic stroke in an aging population through reducing cardiovascular risk factors associated with a sedentary lifestyle. However, confirmation of the reduction of costs in health care will require implementation of a community intervention program on a large scale. There are approximately 2,500 individuals in the Tuscan Region who suffer a stroke annually who would be eligible to participate in an expanded study. The Regional Health System completed a pilot study with 40 individuals in the intervention group and 38 individuals in the control group; it will serve as a model to be expanded. The effort involves the leadership of several different Italian Govermental Health groups including: Office of Tuscana Predictive and Preventive Medicine (Andrea Leto); Technology Assessment Office (Alessandro Reggiani); Scuola Superiore Universitaria Sant" Anna of Pisa (Sabrina Nuti); and the Dipartimento Technologie e Salute (Velio Macellari) lead by Dr. Laura Tramonti, General Director of the Agenzia Regionale Sanita of the Region Toscana. The aforementioned components have worked with the Agenzia Regionale Sanita of the Regione Toscana and have the experience and necessary affiliations to obtain the data records needed to create the rehibilitation research database. They have completed a pilot study demonstrating applicable data management necessary to link the elements that are required to accomplish the rehabilitation data resource. In addition, the group has developed proprietary software to organize the data. The purpose of the proposed project is to expand this pilot into a computerized rehabilitation research data base that will link separate rehabilitation data components such as pre and post health measures of individuals with a chronic condition (e.g., stroke or back pain, etc.) participating in low cost interventions (e.g. adaptive physical activity) in the community with health services and drug utilization information. Expanded support from NICHD will include study components such as, 1) Establishment of a small Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC); 2) expansion of an existing computer based information system; 3) translation of a standardized outcome measure (e.g. SIS, PROMIS); 4) implementation of a telephone interview in the Tuscan region; 5) creation of a patient data file; and, 6) support for collaborative interactions for individuals with chronic conditions. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i), HHSAR 306.302-1(a) (2) (i) b and c. No collect calls will be accepted.

The duration of the BOA will be for a 5 year period.  All items are proprietary in nature for which L-3 owns the drawings and data rights, and may include some modifications that have not been developed as of the date of publication. 

The Government intends to proceed under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 6.302-1.  L-3 Communications Corporation is considered the only supplier, as they have designed and developed the systems that would be modified or repaired under this BOA.  However, the Government will consider all responsible sources and they may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency if received within 15 days after the publication of this synopsis.  Information received as a result of this presolicitation notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  L-3 Communications Corporation owns the technical drawings, specifications and data rights for this product group, the Government does not.  The Government does not possess, nor may it supply prospective offerors, the drawings, specifications, or data

This is a presolicitation notice and is prepared in accordance with FAR 5.207.  The final dollar value of this action will be determined by the actual delivery orders issued.  The anticipated value is not expected to exceed  $5,130,000.  This announcement constitutes the only advertised solicitation; subcontracting opportunities would be available from L-3 Communications Corporation, 1355 Blue Grass Lakes Parkway, Alpharetta, GA.

If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

These parts are unique to the Bradley Fighting Vehicle System (BFVS) A3, these power amplifiers are used in the Turret Drive Control Unit (TDCU). This effort will be synopsized in FEDBIZOPS in accordance with FAR 5.201 alerting contractors of this requirement and the intent of the Government to immediately proceed with this instant procurement.

Currently, the Government does own a TDP for this item; however Curtiss Wright Controls Inc. is the only qualified manufacturer of  these A18 CCAs and that can assemble them into a power amplifier assembly and then has the required Automated Test Equipment (ATE)  to test these power amplifier assemblies at the TDCU performance level. The ATE  for this item must emulate all functions of the digital hardware and software used on the Turret Drive Control Unit in the A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle.

<DESC>This notice will appear for fifteen (15) days from the date above, pursuant to FAR 5.203(a).
The U.S. Geological Survey, Western Region Branch of Acquisition and Grants (USGS), intends to issue a modification noncompetitively increasing the scope of task order 06005W0001 under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract 06WRCN0005 to CLS America, Inc. (CLS), of Largo, MD which provides for Argos satellite data collection and transmission services.  
Argos is a satellite-based data collection and geo-location system which is increasingly used by the USGS to track the movement of migratory wildlife (migratory birds and polar bears are common applications).  A small satellite transmitter (called a platform transmitter terminal, or PTT (sometimes colloquially referred to as a platform telemetry transmitter)) is affixed to the animal of interest and beams either a Doppler-based or GPS-based signal through the Argos satellite system, tracking the location of the animal with an accuracy of (up to) several meters.  Due to the increasing research focus on climate change, which bears on polar bears as related to sea ice loss, and the concern over avian influenza, which bears on migratory birds as an intercontinental disease vector, the USGS has been deploying more PTTs in the past several years than ever before.  Each active PTT incurs data transmission charges through the Argos system.
The Argos system has been operational since 1978.  It was established under an agreement between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) and the French NASA-equivalent, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES).  Japan, the European Union, and India have since joined the Argos system via decisions to fly Argos equipment on their satellites.  In 1986, CNES created a subsidiary, the Collecte Localisation Satellites (CLS), to operate, maintain, and commercialize the Argos system.  Also in 1986, Service Argos, Inc. and North American CLS were created to service North American customers.  In 2006, those two companies merged to form CLS America, Inc., the single company that can provide access to the Argos system for North American users.  For North American customers, such as the USGS, the only access to the Argos system, which is critical to the success of the USGS telemetry program, is through CLS America, Inc.
This notification is provided to the public notwithstanding FAR 16.505(a)(1), which reads "The contracting officer does not synopsize orders under indefinite-delivery contracts."  Contract 06WRCN0005 has reached its ceiling, and the proposed modification to task order 06005W0001 is considered a "contract action" in accordance with FAR 5.001, as an "action(s) for additional supplies or services outside the existing contract scope" which requires synopsis.  For the reasons discussed above, the USGS intends to award this modification to CLS on a noncompetitive basis as there is only one available source.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(15)(i), any other responsible sources may submit a capabilities statement or quotation which will be considered by the USGS, provided it is submitted by the closing date of this announcement.  
This announcement and any resulting modification conform to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-28, effective 12 December 2008.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ENTER INTO SOLE-SOURCE NEGOTIATIONS
This notice will appear for fifteen (15) days from the date above, pursuant to FAR 5.203(a).
The U.S. Geological Survey, Western Region Branch of Acquisition and Grants (USGS), intends to enter into sole-source negotiations to noncompetitively increase the ordering ceiling of indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract 06WRCN0005 to CLS America, Inc. (CLS), of Largo, MD which provides for Argos satellite data collection and transmission services.  
Argos is a satellite-based data collection and geo-location system which is increasingly used by the USGS to track the movement of migratory wildlife (migratory birds and polar bears are common applications).  A small satellite transmitter (called a platform transmitter terminal, or PTT (sometimes colloquially referred to as a platform telemetry transmitter)) is affixed to the animal of interest and beams either a Doppler-based or GPS-based signal through the Argos satellite system, tracking the location of the animal with an accuracy of (up to) several meters.  Due to the increasing research focus on climate change, which bears on polar bears as related to sea ice loss, and the concern over avian influenza, which bears on migratory birds as an intercontinental disease vector, the USGS has been deploying more PTTs in the past several years than ever before.  Each active PTT incurs data transmission charges through the Argos system.
The Argos system has been operational since 1978.  It was established under an agreement between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) and the French NASA-equivalent, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES).

For North American customers, such as the USGS, the only access to the Argos system, which is critical to the success of the USGS telemetry program, is through CLS America, Inc.
This notification is provided to the public because this proposed modification is considered a "contract action" in accordance with FAR 5.001, as an "action(s) for additional supplies or services outside the existing contract scope" which requires synopsis.  For the reasons discussed above, the USGS intends to enter into sole-source negotiations with CLS in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(15)(ii), any other responsible sources may submit a capabilities statement or proposal which will be considered by the USGS, provided it is submitted by the closing date of this announcement.  
This announcement and any resulting modification conform to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-28, effective 12 December 2008.

<DESC><p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract. The notice is to announce the revision of the contract maximum amount on the Raven-B Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (SUAV) spares contract supporting the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). This contract was awarded to AeroVironment Inc. in August 2008 as a Sole Source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with an anticipated period of performance through August 2011. The basis for this sole source action was FAR 6.302-1(b)(1), Only one Responsible source, as the Government does not own rights to the data needed to manufacture the required spare parts. This action was synopsized and no other company indicated the capability to manufacture the required spares. At time of award, the contract maximum for the three year period was $3,000,000. An engineering design modification to integrate a Digital Data Link (DDL) configuration change has generated the need for an adjustment to the contract maximum. To facilitate integration of the DDL into multiple spares contract line items and to obtain DDL retrofit kits, it is necessary to increase the contract maximum from $3M to $10M. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>Capable sources are sought to provide research and development (R&amp;D) to AFRL/RI in multiple technology areas as described herein. Work will be conducted at Rome Research Site (RRS) and the Newport and Stockbridge Research Facilities located within a 35 mile radius of Rome, NY. Each research facility is unique and requires specialized expertise to perform its dedicated mission.</p>
<p>The Communications Technology Laboratory is a Radio Frequency (RF) and general purpose, multi-use communications laboratory located in RRS, Bldg. 3. Laboratory facilities include two electro-magnetic (EM) anechoic chamber facilities (40 ft wide, 48 ft long, 32 ft high; 12 ft wide, 36 ft long, 12 ft high) with continuous frequency coverage from 50MZ to 18 GHZ, an Electronic Discharge (ESD) work station area, a number of project work areas for hardware and software development, and a small scale machine shop. The anechoic chamber facility provides an interface free electro-magnetic environment and is used to perform antenna pattern measurements and to evaluate various RF system parameters. Current work projects in the facility include: the Smart Radio Testbed which is developing and evaluating advanced signal processing techniques for insertion into the Joint Tactical Radio System and other software defined radio programs; the Remote Radio Testbed which designs and evaluates remote operation capabilities for a variety of military radio systems, and the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Rapid Prototyping project which is developing advanced communications and signal processing algorithms. A full complement of signal sources, test equipment and instrumentation is available to support the various technical projects. The laboratory has fiber optic connectivity to the inter-site microwave radio system from Bldg. 3 to the Stockbridge Research Facility and subsequently to the Newport Research Facility.</p>
<p><br />The Newport Research Site is a far field antenna range primarily used to evaluate antenna systems installed on full size tactical airframes. This facility consists of two hilltop sites 7520 feet apart. The site consists of multiple elevated and ground reflection ranges; control rooms; office and hanger space; a limited machine shop; and data reduction facilities. Current airframe resources available include: an A-10, an F-15, two F-16s, an F-22, two F-35s, an SH-60 helicopter and sections of B-1, C-130 and KC-135 aircraft.</p>
<p>The Stockbridge Research Site is a more generalized test range encompassing 300 acres of land. The facility has a 108 foot jib tower arching over a rotatable pedestal which is capable of supporting 140,000 pounds; two 600 foot runways; office and lab space; and a small machine shop capability. Current projects at this facility include: Radio Frequency Tomography experimentation; optical network connectivity experiments; and airborne networking research using small unmanned aircraft systems (SUAS). Respondents must demonstrate knowledge in FAA flight approval process, maintenance of SUAS and have flight certification.</p>
<p>The availability of experienced technical personnel in the identified technology areas is essential to ensure timely, cost effective, and successful completion of the R&amp;D effort in a safe manner. Safety is of paramount importance due to the rigging of large airframes, inert munitions, fuel tanks, antennas, and other large mechanical structures onto and off of support towers and positioners.</p>
<p>Respondents must demonstrate knowledge/expertise in the following areas: antenna range testing, operations and maintenance; advanced antenna design, integration, and evaluation; communications signal processing; advanced communications environments; communications network design and administration; design and development of electronic hardware, equipment instrumentation, and measurement methodology; and software development and integration.</p>
<p>An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 60 months. The maximum contemplated ordering amount is anticipated to be approximately $30,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The specific requirements for each order will be identified in individual work descriptions; however, the contemplated tasking under this effort is as follows: 1) Operate and maintain antenna test ranges and research facilities, participate in planning and conducting the integration of hardware, software, equipment, and instrumentation into technology experiments, demonstrations, and evaluation programs and field exercises; 2) Design and develop hardware, equipment, instrumentation and measurement procedures; and 3) Maintain, modify, upgrade, and operate equipment, hardware, instrumentation, and LANs/ WANs. Develop test plan documentation. Record, document, analyze, and evaluate technical data. Provide software development, maintenance, and upgrades. Provide technical project planning and coordination. Prepare and present formal and informal briefings. Attend technical meetings for the purpose of providing technical expertise. Provide mechanical design and drafting using computer aided design (CAD) software. Provide personnel with specialized skills to include welding, structural ironwork, rigging of large airframes and structures, operation of heavy construction equipment, and geodetic surveying. Conduct multi-path studies, range analysis, and propagation studies to establish measured data validity and repeatability. Provide engineering management, program management, resource management, and real property management functions.</p>
<p>Approximately three (3) personnel with Top Secret SCI clearances will be required at time of award with the capability of integrating an additional three (3) individuals during performance.</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought are requested from small businesses and will be used for market research purposes and possible set-aside. Should the determination be made to select this as a small business set-aside, another notice will be posted reflecting such. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541712, 1,500 employees.

Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Susan Hunter, Building 15, Room 225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130, phone 937-255-7754, fax 937-255-5036.

Introduction
The purpose of this Notice is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) capable of acting as the national administrative contractor for the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) 1 Section 1011, Federal Reimbursement of Emergency Health Services Furnished to Undocumented Aliens program.  

Background

Section 1011 of the MMA (Federal Reimbursement of Emergency Health Services Furnished to Undocumented Aliens) (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/UndocAliens/Downloads/sec1011.pdf) requires that the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS) directly pay certain hospitals, physicians, and ambulance suppliers2 for their un-reimbursed costs of furnishing certain emergency services3 to certain patients4.  In response to this statutory mandate, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking an administrative contractor for the Section 1011 program.  

Section 1011 appropriated $250 million per year for each of fiscal years (FYs) 2005 through 2008, for provider payments, and requires that these funds remain available until expended.  As of December 2008, $328.8 million remains.  Section 1011 funds are allocated by state and the amount of each states allocation differs from each other, each determined according to the size of its resident alien population and the number of alien apprehensions made each year, as determined by statistics provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  The Section 1011 program will continue operations until all funds are expended, even though no additional monies will be appropriated beyond FY 2008.

The Provider Billing Group, within the CMS Center for Medicare Management, is charged with contracting oversight, administration, and management of the Section 1011 program, which became operational at award of the first administrative contract in July 2005.  The original effective date of the Section 1011 program was for claims with dates of service May 10, 2005 and after.  Total provider payments have historically averaged approximately $50 million per quarter and are required to be made electronically.  The program will continue operations under its current administrative contract through calendar year 2009.   The contractor that is awarded the second administrative contract for the program will inherit existing government-owned systems, property, processes, and protocols for continuing program administration.  The contractor will also receive training from the existing administrative contractor for a prescribed period of time (a transition period), after which the new administrative contractor must be fully independent and operational by January 1, 2010.  The new contractor must further meet at least the requirements identified below.

Notes

1 Pub. L. 108-173

2 Eligible providers include hospitals, physicians, and ambulance services (including both Indian Health Service facilities whether operated by the Indian Health Service or by an Indian tribe or tribal organization, and Critical Access Hospitals)

3 Eligible services include health care services required by the application of section 1867 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395dd), and related hospital inpatient and outpatient and ambulance services.  

Note #3 History: 
Sections 1866(a)(1)(I), 1866(a)(1)(N), and 1867 of the Social Security Act impose specific obligations on Medicare participating hospitals that offer emergency services.  These obligations concern individuals who come to a hospital emergency department and request examination or treatment for medical conditions, and apply to all of these individuals, regardless of whether or not they are beneficiaries of any program under the Act.  Section 1867 of the Act sets forth requirements for medical screening examinations of medical conditions, as well as necessary stabilizing treatment or appropriate transfer.  In addition, section 1867(h) of the Act specifically prohibits a delay in providing required screening or stabilization services in order to inquire about the individual's payment method or insurance status.  Section 1867(d) of the Act provides for the imposition of civil monetary penalties on hospitals and physicians responsible for negligently violating a requirement of that section, through actions such as the following: (a) Negligently failing to appropriately screen an individual seeking medical care; (b) negligently failing to provide stabilizing treatment to an individual with an emergency medical condition; or (c) negligently transferring an individual in an inappropriate manner (Section 1867(e)(4) of the Act defines "transfer" to include both transfers to other health care facilities and cases in which the individual is released from the care of the hospital without being moved to another health care facility).
 
These provisions, taken together, are frequently referred to as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), also known as the patient anti-dumping statute.  EMTALA was passed in 1986 as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).  Congress enacted these anti-dumping provisions in the Social Security Act because of its concern with an increasing number of reports that hospital emergency rooms were refusing to accept or treat individuals with emergency conditions if the individuals did not have insurance.  

4  Payment under Section 1011 is allowed for patients who are any of the following: (A) Undocumented aliens, (B) Aliens who have been paroled into the U.S. at a U.S. port of entry for the purpose of receiving eligible services, (C) Mexican citizens permitted to enter the U.S. under the authority of a biometric machine-readable border crossing identification card (laser visa) issued in accordance with the requirements of regulations prescribed under section 1101(a)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(6)).

<SUBJECT>Research Project - Non-Rational Behavior in the Financial Sector
<SOLNBR>TIRNO-09-Non-RationalBehaviorInFinancialSector
<RESPDATE>012209
<CONTACT>Jeffrey S. Cornell, Contract Specialist, Phone 2022834965, Email jeffrey.s.cornell@irs.gov
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS - NON-RATIONAL BEHAVIOR IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR. BACKGROUND - Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Wage and Investment Research and Analysis (WIRA) is primarily focused on increasing compliance with tax laws by improving the taxpayer experience and reducing taxpayer burden. Through its research, WIRA assists other Wage and Investment functions to increase taxpayer compliance through improved service. WIRAs focus on improving taxpayer service is exemplified by its contribution to the Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint (TAB). Additional information can be found at http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=156394,00.html. TAB began in 2005 when Congress requested the IRS develop a five-year plan to address taxpayer service. The IRS implemented the TAB project as a two-phase effort designed to answer questions about the needs and preferences of individual taxpayers. TAB Phase 1 included preliminary research on taxpayer needs, preferences, and behaviors. The TAB Phase 1 report, delivered to Congress in April 2006, included a baseline of current taxpayer services and outlined key strategic improvement themes.  The TAB Phase 2 Report included a careful analysis of a large body of research. Because of the extensive research completed for TAB, IRS now knows more than ever before about taxpayer needs, preferences, and behaviors. The next steps are to further the research on taxpayer needs, preferences, and behaviors and to improve IRS taxpayer service. This project will advance those objectives.  WIRA REQUIREMENTS - WIRA requests vendor assistance to understand non-rational behavior as it relates to financial issues. Emerging social science has questioned the theory of the purely rational economic person and demonstrated that people may act illogically when faced with difficult or complex decisions. Similarly, some taxpayers may be confused or unsure of their tax obligations, and consequently less compliant. WIRA is seeking assistance to identify those groups, address their needs, and modify IRS operations to improve taxpayer service and compliance.  The vendor will collaborate with WIRA to develop actionable research results that can be applied to current IRS processes and procedures, notices, publications, media outreach, telephone operations, and other taxpayer services. Based on its studies on non-rational behavior, the vendor will provide the IRS targeted recommendations to improve its communication programs and business processes to increase taxpayer compliance through improved service.  STATEMENT OF CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS - The IRS is requesting a Statement of Capabilities qualification package from interested vendors, including resumes. The qualification package will detail why the vendors are technically qualified to assist WIRA in its research projects on understanding taxpayer non-rational behavior with regards to financial issues, particularly tax compliance. The vendors may submit examples of their innovative research on non-rational behavior in the financial sector as part of their capability statement, such as published articles in business or academic journals.  You are required to submit four (4) hard copies of the Statement of Capabilities with resumes and/or published articles attached.  IN ADDITION YOU SHALL PROVIDE ONE (1) CD-ROM COPY INCLUSIVE OF ALL ATTACHMENTS along with the hard copies. The CD-ROM should be affixed inside page 1 of copy 1 of the Statement of Capabilities. Any firms submitting a Statement of Capabilities without a fully functional CD-ROM copy will not be evaluated further. There is a 10-page limitation (single-sided, Times New Roman 10 pt. font, 1-inch margins) on the Statement of Capabilities. The Statement of Capabilities qualification package will be provided using Microsoft Office products (ex., MS Word). Resumes and published articles will not count toward the 10-page limitation.  A capable vendor would demonstrate extensive experience and background in research on non-rational behavior in the financial sector. A capable vendor will demonstrate the positive impact of their assistance to clients similar to the IRS. Positive impact can be defined as increasing market share, improving customer satisfaction, reducing operational costs, or enhancing any other significant measure.  A capable vendor will have assisted clients with attributes similar to the IRS. For example, the successful vendors clients would have over $1 billion in appropriations, revenue and/or assets, have a national presence, and have significant impact on US financial services. Possible vendor clients would be other US federal agencies, large US corporations, or non-profit entities, and have significant involvement in US financial services.  Firms interested in responding to this sources sought synopsis should submit a Statement of Capabilities package be to RECEIVED by the IRS no later than 2:00 pm EST on Thursday January 22, 2009, in accordance with the instructions provided above, to the attention of: Internal Revenue Service, Attn: Jeff Cornell  Contract Specialist, 6009 Oxon Hill Road, 9th Floor Studies & Analysis Section, Oxon Hill, MD 20745. Any questions should be directed to Jeff Cornell, ph: (202) 283-4965.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Employee Relocation System</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information</strong></p>
<p>This posting is being used only for market research purposes. If your firm offers a product which meets the requirements stated herein, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) wants to be made aware of it. The USDA encourages all businesses to respond. The market research will be used as one set of factors in making a decision about the acquisition method to be employed. We would like to receive responses one week after posting.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals. Responding to this posting does not confer any rights to the vendor.</p>
<p><br /><strong>I. Overview</strong></p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) seeks sources of software that will provide a web-based employee relocation system. This system will be incorporated into USDA's new Relocation Resource Center (RRC), which will be a full-service, permanent-change-of-station processing center.</p>
<p>The USDA relocates approximately 2,000 employees per year. Currently, USDA's relocation processing is decentralized with all relocation transactions eventually being processed by the Controller Operations Division (COD) located in New Orleans, Louisiana. Relocations involve complex financial transactions, consisting of an authorization, possible amendments, multiple vouchers (i.e., claims), and tax offsets. Most of these transactions are handled manually in a time consuming manner and some data is tracked by agencies via a myriad of spreadsheets. Many of the relocation transactions are ultimately processed by COD's legacy relocation travel system, which is being phased out as USDA's new accounting system, FMMI, is fielded.</p>
<p>The RRC shall establish a standard streamlined methodology to perform associated tasks, reduce variability across USDA, and add cost savings by centralizing the relocation process. The RRC will provide full-service to employees, including counseling employees on the various relocation entitlements, vendor selection, processing payments, and preparing W-2's for employees when relocation expense reimbursements impact reportable income. This includes Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA) follow-up activity with travelers to ensure full tax advantages are realized.</p>
<p><br /><strong>II. Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The new system must have the following features:</p>
<p>1. Automated enforcement of government and agency relocation regulations for domestic and overseas moves.<br />2. Automated and accurate calculation of relocation entitlements.<br />3. Centralized database that stores detailed record level expense data for all relocation allowances (i.e. house hunting trip, household goods, en route travel, temporary quarters, real estate, miscellaneous expenses, taxes, etc.).<br />4. Web-based for ease of access by multiple users (approvers, movees, administrators, and people at multiple organizations across the enterprise).<br />5. Enterprise-level capability to handle future expansion to other organizations within an agency and to other agencies.<br />6. Automated processing of relocation expense documents, including authorizations, vouchers, RITA payments and amendment documents. System should store document history. System should present document as printable forms.<br />7. Maintenance and storage of pertinent employee information (i.e. name, addresses, dependents, salary, etc.).<br />8. Maintenance and storage of pertinent relocation and accounting information (i.e. report date, authorization number, duty station information, accounting codes, etc.).<br />9. Maintenance, storage and automated update of all necessary government rates (i.e. per diem, mileage, RIT, payroll, etc.).<br />10. Replace manual survey process with the ability to allow movee to electronically submit relocation data necessary for authorizations.<br />11. Provide reports summarizing relocation expenses by employee, relocation destination, accounting code, and accounting element. Support ad hoc reporting per agency request. <br />12. Ability to generate end of year relocation W-2 forms.<br />13. Interface capabilities with FMMI.<br />14. Compliance with Federal Enterprise Architecture.<br />15. Compliance with Section 508 for accessibility.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A FORMAL SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.2.  The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides an integrated, systematic approach to the development and purchase of the necessary vaccines, drugs, therapies, and diagnostic tools for public health medical emergencies.  BARDAs mission includes managing the advanced research and development of medical countermeasures (MCM) for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents (CBRN).  

As part of its CBRN medical countermeasure development and preparedness mission, BARDA contemplates a five year Cost Reimbursement, multiple award contract for the advanced development and manufacturing of therapeutics on the path to licensure or market approval (i.e., BLA or NDA, respectively) for the indication of treating neutropenia arising from acute exposure to ionizing radiation, (Acute Radiation Syndrome, ARS).  This announcement will support ARS product development activities on the path to obtaining a New Drug Application (NDA) or a Biologic License Application (BLA), including:

 Manufacturing scale-up supporting consistent lot-to-lot manufacturing.
 Clinical trials, if feasible and ethical.
 Establishing appropriate animal models, as necessary.
 Animal studies leading to pivotal animal efficacy data required to support licensure under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Animal Rule (Approval of Biological Products when Human Efficacy Studies are not Ethical or feasible" 21 CFR 601 Subpart H, as well as 21 CFR 314 Subpart I for New Drugs) .

This is not a procurement solicitation.

In order to be considered eligible to submit a proposal under this solicitation, the Offeror(s) shall meet the following two mandatory criteria for eligibility:  
1) The Offeror shall provide documentation that shows they have met with the appropriate review division at the FDA to consult on the appropriate path for approval of their proposed therapeutic for use in treating neutropenia caused by Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).  Documentation should include, but is not limited to, a cover page, executive summary, and a table of contents that demonstrates the Offerors intent to file an IND for ARS.  FDA meeting minutes should also be included.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER (PSC) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, or women-owned small business) under NAICS code, 624230, that have the capability, capacity, experience, and expert knowledge of the disaster case management services operating in arduous conditions in support of disaster declared regions in the continental United States. 

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) has a requirement for a follow-on contract which consist of a base plus four option years.  ACF seeks a qualified provider (non profit, university, corporation, organizationetc) that can identify, assemble and deploy a three tiered system of national, regional and local Disaster Case Managers to a declared disaster area(s) within 72 hours upon notification. A three tiered system of National, Regional and local teams comprise the basic infrastructure of the DCM Model. The teams at all three levels allow for flexibility, speed, and scalability based upon the size and scope of the disaster and impacted area.  Upon arrival the National team begins coordinating program implementation, serves as subject matter experts for disaster case management, works with the state  to identify key points of contact and begins outreach to identify a network of local disaster case management agencies.  The following are key positions included on the National team:

	Disaster Case Management Team Leader (ACF role)
	Healthcare Consultant (ACF)
	Social Services Consultant (ACF)
	State Coordinator
	National Partner Lead Coordinator
	Information Technology (IT) Coordinator 
	Training Coordinator
	Community Coordinator
	Compliance/Finance Coordinator
	Regional Team Coordinator
	Administrative and Logistics Coordinator

Regional teams are comprised of volunteers (paid or unpaid) identified, trained, equipped, and coordinated by the National Partner.  Multiple Regional Teams are necessary to meet needs in the immediate aftermath of a disaster.   Regional Teams are comprised of the following:

	Case Management Supervisors (Ratio of 1 to 5)
	Nurses/Social Workers for consultation of Federal resources and provision of initial case management
	Case Managers 
	Client Assistants
	Client Navigators
	Volunteer Coordinator (depending upon the scale of or type of disaster)
	Administrative and logistics coordinator

The Local Teams are comprised of individuals or affiliates from local communities with experience in disaster case management.  Local agency case managers will be required to meet the same qualifications and screening process as the regional teams.  Ideally, a pre-identified state or local system for providing disaster case management exists to which all cases can be referred when the regional team is no longer needed.
 
PURPOSE:

The purpose of disaster case management is to rapidly return individuals and families who have survived a disaster to a state of self-sufficiency.  This is accomplished by ensuring that each individual has access to a case manager who will take information about the individuals situation and then serve as his or her advocate and help him or her organize and access the disaster related resources, human services, medical and mental health care that will help them achieve pre-disaster levels of functioning and equilibrium.  The Federal government, to the extent possible, will endeavor to prepare for and reduce disaster impact on existing service delivery to their citizens by aiding in connecting disaster clients to services.  More quickly linking disaster clients to appropriate assistance will reduce the likelihood that they will require more intensive healthcare and social service benefits and thus reduce the impact on States and existing systems.
BACKROUND:

Prior to Hurricane Katrina and Rita there was no federal authority to fund disaster case management as part of a Stafford Act declaration.  Consequently, case management had to be provided through donated funds and by voluntary agencies.  The case management that was provided connected individuals to disaster specific services based on disaster recovery plans.  

Hurricanes Katrina and Rita affected over 1 million people, causing extensive damage to existing infrastructure.  Many of those affected were already depending on federal assistance programs or suddenly found themselves in need of human or medical services paid for or provided by the government.  It became apparent that a case management system was needed for those kinds of large scale displacements.  Specifically, any system should assess individual and family needs and assists with connecting them with the appropriate healthcare, mental health, human and disaster specific services to address immediate circumstances and long-term requirements. 

Congress passed the Post Katrina Emergency Reform Act of 2006 in recognition of this need.  The Act recognized the need for comprehensive Disaster Case Management and authorized its development by stating, the President may provide case management services, including financial assistance, to State or Local government agencies or qualified private organizations to provide such services to victims of major disasters to identify and address unmet needs. This program is specifically designed to integrate with existing state and local case management systems.  The ultimate goal is to return citizens to their pre-disaster level of self-sufficiency, when appropriate. 

TASKS:

To assist in the recovery efforts and to provide timely and needed human and disaster services to person impacted by a disaster, it is necessary to establish a contract for the provision of disaster case management services. This contract will enable OHSEPR to assist clients in need of disaster case management following a declared disaster.  The contractor will abide by the ACF Disaster Case Management model and the accompanying DCM Implementation Guide.  The following are steps and procedures the contractor must take during the delivery of DCM services:

	Conduct a community-wide rapid needs assessment to identify available short- and long-term resources for disaster victims in conjunction with Federal, state, and local stakeholders. Coordinate with partners to ensure compliance with all relevant local, state and Federal.
	Contact and coordinate with Federal, state and local relief and recovery agencies and organizations, including the long-term recovery committee or equivalent.
	Arrange for a call center to triage and pre-qualify individuals for services.
	Provide support and financial supplementation to local support entities that partner with the contractor for the provision of case management services consistent with this contract.
	Provide on-site and ongoing training to the Disaster Case Management team members that includes instruction on the model and existing human services within the affected region.
	Provide outreach and intake services to identify victims who need and qualify for disaster case management services; this service should be provided in conjunction with the Disaster Recovery Centers until permanent locations are identified.
	To the extent possible, form a seamless program that integrates with voluntary agencies and state programs in order to avoid duplication of services.
	Establish an organizational structure and implement staff supervision procedures for Regional and Local  DCM teams to ensure that the team functions cohesively, effectively, in coordination with other Federal, state, and local responders and service providers, and with appropriate leadership and accountability;
	Provide disaster case management and referral services to clients. Beginning by developing mutually agreed upon recovery plans for individuals to return to their pre-disaster status with the longer-term goal of economic self-sufficiency. Services should continue until clients have completed their recovery plan or are referred to other service providers.
	Connect clients to existing services offered by Federal, state, and local agencies, as well as voluntary organizations.
	Track the services provided and progress of individual clients using the to-be-specified client tracking system.
	Develop a local network of providers that represents voluntary service agencies and other organizations that provide services to individuals with special needs.

Scope & Objective
The United States Postal Service is seeking information regarding secured document destruction.  The documents to be destroyed will be First Class mail that, for whatever reason, can not be delivered.  


Background
It has been the USPS practice to return all First Class Mail, which can not be delivered, to the original sender.  This practice exacts a cost from the Postal Service for each piece of mail returned.  The Major Mailers Association in conjunction with the USPS has agreed that a secured destruction process for First Class Mail which the sender does not want returned will not only provide cost savings to the USPS but also the MMA members that would normally be required to destroy the returned mail once received.  The USPS is seeking a process that provides a verifiable custodial audit trail for the destruction of the documents and provides protection from identity theft for its customers.


RFI Synopsis
The RFI submitter is expected, at a minimum, to respond to the following questions with accurate, detailed and complete responses.  The submitter must also provide any other pertinent information relating to their secured destruction process.

9.	Describe in detail your custodial audit trail for secured document destruction. 
10.	Provide a detailed description and flow chart of the document destruction process beginning with the document entering your receptacle at the USPS facility through the recycling or disposal of the destroyed material. Include your ability to meet HIPAA, FACTA or other government privacy standards.

12.	Provide the shredding capacity, and speed specifications for your equipment used to destroy paper media.
13.	Describe the shredding vehicles in your fleet and their security features.
14.	What proof do you provide that documents were destroyed?
15.	With respect to destruction of paper documents, please provide the destruction methods employed.  For any shredding process, please provide the range for the width and length of the resulting shredded paper.
16.	Does your company have the ability to securely destroy confidential media other than paper?  If so please describe, including recycling options.
17.	Describe the range of containers that your company can place at our facilities?  Do you have the capacity to provide custom containers? 
18.	Provide insurance coverage information for general liability and workers compensation.
19.	Provide any rents, charges or other fees involved in the placement of containers.
20.	Provide a typical implementation plan with measurable milestones.

Technologies will be assessed based on their contribution to reducing key maritime mission risks in the following four areas:

I.   Small Vessel Identification/Tracking  challenge of distinguishing between the vast number of legitimate vessel operators and the relatively few individuals engaged in illicit activities

II.  Tracking Certain Dangerous Cargo (CDC) Barges  automatically track CDC barges in real or near-real time

III.  River Level/Velocity Detection  measure and report not only river levels, but also current velocity at critical points, to aid the USCG and mariners in critical decisions related to towing safety

IV.  Information-based Awareness (IBA)  support Command Center watchstander understanding of information presented to them

Organizations responding to this RFI may respond to one or more of the four topics discussed above.

<DESC><p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).
<p>The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to solicit both federal agency and industry feedback regarding the marketing of infrastructure energy saving tools and ideas for application across Buckley Air Force Base. This RFI is to solicit interest from both federal agencies and companies in how to market their energy reduction and energy savings technology concepts at a "Green Infrastructures" trade fair. If enough interest is expressed, a trade fair will be held no sooner than 19 February 2009 at the Community Leadership Development Center (CLDC) at Buckley Air Force Base (AFB) in Aurora, Colorado.</p>
<p>MARKETING/ACQUISITION STRATEGY ISSUES:</p>
<p>SCOPE: This is an invitation to participate in an industry day event at Buckley AFB. This announcement serves to solicit suggestions on how to categorize technology ideas in an all-day trade fair. Since Buckley AFB encompasses many different tenants occupying buildings of varying ages and condition, the strategy arrived at needs to allow for the broadest scope of energy savings ideas in order to afford all government customers an opportunity to benefit from industry ideas exhibited during the trade fair. It should cover how to "green-up" older buildings as well as how to start off green in new developments.</p>
<p>TRADE FAIR OBJECTIVES: The objective of this trade fair is to afford government customers an opportunity to assess energy savings solutions for incorporation into future work requirements to be funded over the next few years. As such, a broad objective of the trade fair should encompass some or all of the leading-edge government and commercial technology ideas outlined below:</p>
<p>1. The U.S. Department of Energy has a goal to create the technology and knowledge base for cost-effective zero-energy buildings by 2025. A zero energy building produces as much energy on-site as it consumes on an annual basis, primarily through energy efficiency with any small remaining loads met by photovoltaics and other solar energy technologies.</p>
<p>2. Department of Defense energy goals are much more stringent than the goals identified under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Executive Order 13423, and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Department of Defense Goals: 3% energy reduction per year for a total of 30% (gas &amp; electric) by 2015, water reduction of 2% per year for a total of 16% by 2015, and a 25% renewable goal by 2025.</p>
<p>3. Whole-building integration - A systems integration approach that enables advanced technologies to function more efficiently. This process meets the challenge of reliability and projected cost requirements for buildings. Used in retrofit application, these types of technologies provide one of the best opportunities to increase energy efficiency in existing buildings.</p>
<p>4. Building Controls are important for the energy efficiency of buildings, enabling building equipment to operate at peak energy efficiency. The current generations of building controls are outdated when compared to controls in other industries. With low-energy buildings, the importance of controls and fault diagnostics becomes more important.</p>
<p>5. Focus on the creation of highly flexible "technology option sets" that can be combined in various ways to reach anywhere from 50% to 70% energy savings. This could entail an integrated group of building envelope, equipment, and control system technologies that each influence the energy performance of the other that when combined act as one system.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS: The Government is interested in obtaining the following information from other federal agencies and industry to consider in determining the optimal approach for the marketing of infrastructure energy solutions during a trade fair.</p>
<p>1. Federal agency or private sector interest in attending a one-day trade fair.</p>
<p>2. Subcontractors interested in attending for marketing and possible partnering of new energy saving processes with prime contractors.</p>
<p>3. Maximize marketing of information and services without the use of electrical connections at the trade fair site.</p>
<p>4. Benefit of allowing selected locally or nationally recognized speakers an opportunity to lecture to the gathering on a pro bono basis</p>
<p>5. Recommendation of best dates to hold a trade fair in late February to 31 March 2009 from a Tuesday through Thursday schedule.</p>
<p>6. Logistics in submitting company and personnel information for an Entry Access Letter (EAL) onto Buckley AFB seven calendar days prior to event.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this RFI will be in the form of a White Paper, not to exceed ten (10) pages, and if desired also supported by a Microsoft Power Point briefing, including notes, not to exceed eight (8) slides. Submit responses, via e-mail, to Lt. Shawn Curro at shawn.curro@buckley.af.mil not later than 28 January 2009.</p>

<DESC><p>US SOCOM requires internet access to news services that focus on the activities of Capitol Hill and the members of Congress. National Journal Congress Daily is unique in the depth and substance of analysis it provides National Journal provides insight into the personal activities and philosophies of various Congressional members. It analyzes conversations, strategies and alliances that drive Congressional action. No other internet service provides this insight to the magnitude of National Journal Congress Daily. National Journal Congress Daily is critical in providing a balanced perspective on Congressional issues. US SOCOM needs to have more than one source for Congressional analysis and news in order to provide the SOCOM Commander with the best information to shape critical decisions he has to make.

This announcement is for informational purposes only.  The Government intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source basis to Global Trade Information Services Inc (GTIS) for detailed export/import trade data at the six digit level in two chemicals, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which are widely used in pharmaceuticals, but are also frequently diverted into illegal use as precursor chemicals to manufacture methamphetamine stimulants.  INL is required by legislation to analyze world trade in these chemicals to identify trading countries with a high diversion risk for these two meth-precursors.  The data INL is seeking must be comparable to data we have used in past INCSR reports, and it must be readily available at our computer terminals, so we can move it into analytical spreadsheets without laborious by-hand data entry.  Any interested parties in this requirement must provide information to support its ability to meet the above. This information must be received by 4 pm ET, January 09, 2009, to the attention of Brian Schoellkopf at SchoellkopfBJ@state.gov.

<DESC>In compliance with the Commands initiative to enhance Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) for Fleet Hospital applications, the only technically acceptable item that has (ILS) support is the Model LF-TP Tracheal Intubation Fiberscope manufactured by Olympus America.  The Model LF-TP Tracheal Intubation Fiberscope manufactured by Olympus America has been standardized for all of the fleet hospitals.  The installed base is currently in more than half of the fleet hospitals as well as each new hospital that is being built.   Therefore, the installed base of the Olympus America Tracheal Intubation Fiberscope within the Fleet Hospital Program exceeds $80,000.00.  The amount of US Navy dollars invested in the consumables associated with this item is difficult to estimate, but can be considered to be approximately 10% of that cost or $8,000.  The Navy spends approximately $10,000 each year to maintain the Integrated Logistics Support for an item and all of its accessories, consumables and variants.    These items were standardized to maintain interoperability between all of the fleet hospitals.  The choice of any other manufacturer would result in a breakdown of that interoperability between fleet hospitals and reduce the lifesaving capability of each of the fleet hospitals.  The list above identifies the equipment and accessories that must be procured to satisfy the needs of the government.

<DESC><p>Combined Synopsis/Request for Proposal<br />BAO Kit Rugged Lightweight Computers
<p>1. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is soliciting proposals and initial purchase of ten (10) and up to 600 BAO Kit rugged lightweight computer systems. This project is part of the broader Battlefield Airmen program, currently addressing requirements for combat control/special tactics and pararescue. This combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items was prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation FA8629-09-R-2425 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) using the streamlined procedures for evaluation of commercial items as outlined in FAR 12.6. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24. The acquisition will be processed as a full and open competition. The associated NAICS code is 334111.</p>
<p>2. Respondents to this Request for Proposal (RFP) should submit a fact sheet and a bid for a rugged lightweight computer system with the attributes listed on Attachment 1 to this RFP package. Each system shall consist of the computer, one (1) additional solid state hard drive, a MOLLE carry pouch (see Attachment 2 for sample picture), a docking station, a 1-bay battery charger, and shall include the standard warranty available for the computer and hard drive. Please state what is included in the standard warranty for all pieces of this system. In addition, please state if higher level warranties are available, what they entail, and the costs associated with those warranties. In the event that this office determines to purchase a higher level warranty, that warranty will be included as a separate CLIN in the contract.</p>
<p>3. In addition, we are soliciting a quote for an additional buy of up to 600 computers. These may be purchased as funding becomes available. Therefore, all offerors shall propose any quantity discount(s) available, and what the minimum order is to receive any quantity discount. This additional purchase will be placed as an option in the ensuing contract.</p>
<p>4. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is incorporated and the Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. As indicated on the attached Standard Form 1449, award will be made on the basis of a simplified trade-off. In this instance, technical selection criteria will be of greater importance than cost. The Government will also evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s) and general statements that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well-known techniques will be used, or paraphrases of the RFP specification in whole or in part will not constitute compliance with this requirement concerning the content of the technical requirement. Offerors shall complete and submit with each proposal FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items and DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items.</p>
<p>5. Two (2) paper copies should be submitted to the address listed in paragraph 7 below. Paper copies must be clearly labeled "Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Information" on the cover sheets and in close proximity to this type of information, on each applicable page. Proprietary/Competition Sensitive information will be protected from disclosure. E-mail copies of the paper submittal will be accepted. In addition, in accordance with FAR clause 52.212-01(d), two (2) computers shall be delivered concurrent to your proposal for additional evaluation. These two computers shall include the Windows XP Pro operating system. After review is completed then computers will be returned to the vendor. Please include name, address, and shipping information (including vendor's FedEx numbers) for return of these items.</p>
<p>6. First delivery of ten (10) computers is scheduled for two (2) weeks after the contract is awarded. The place of delivery is listed in the model contract attached hereto. The contractor shall propose a delivery schedule for the remainder of the computer systems.</p>
<p>7. Responses and prototypes shall be received no later than 20 January 2009. Paper/e-mail submittals should be sent to 670 AESS/PK, Attn: Nancy Leggett, 1895 Fifth Street, Bldg 46, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7200. E-mail address is nancy.leggett@wpafb.af.mil. Telephone is 937-255-1696.</p>

The Government intends to award a firm fixed price, Blanket Purchase Agreement resulting from this solicitation to the responsible, single offeror whose offer is the Best Value, price and other factors considered.  Technical Factors A-F will be evaluated individually on a pass/fail basis. If an offerors technical proposal is judged to have failed any one of the Factors A-F the firms offer will receive no further consideration for award.  If two or more offerors technical proposals are judged to have passed all Factors A F (Minimum Technical Qualifications), then they will be ranked against all other offerors passing the minimum qualifications using Enhancing Technical Factor G. Offerors passing the Minimum Technical Qualifications will subsequently be evaluated on Past Performance and Price. The technical and past performance factors below, combined are more important than price, and are listed in descending order of importance.  Past Performance is more important than price However, price may become a critical factor in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of technical and past performance factors.  Evaluation of price will be based on the offerors total price.

Minimum Technical Qualifications: 
a. Contractor shall manufacture all of the required valves 
b.Contractor shall replace valves that are near expiration 
c.Contractor shall replace used valves within 48 hours
d. The offeror shall provide porcine bioprosthetic aortic valves size 19mm and up
e.  The offeror shall provide porcine bioprosthetic mitral valves size 25mm and up.
f.  All valves shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.  

The Factor identified below will be the evaluation factor used to evaluate all offers passing all Minimal Technical Qualifications A-F

Enhancing Technical Factor to be used in a Contract Award Decision:   
g) Product Performance- This evaluation may include stroke rate, early failures, ease of implementation.  Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of product performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.

Past Performance Evaluation Factors

 The offeror shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The offeror should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the offeror.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other offerors.  The offeror should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the offerors past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

 Price Evaluation Factor
 (i)Completeness.  The offeror has submitted a total price, completed all required representations and certifications, and acknowledgement of any amendments.  (ii) Reasonableness.  The Government's determination that the proposed price is fair and reasonable based on price analysis.                                                                                               

The offerors initial proposal shall contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.   The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offeror if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted in order to achieve best value.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the highest rated offeror.  The Government reserves the right to make no award as a result of this solicitation.

OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE INSTRUCTIONS:

Central Contractor Registration (CCR):  

Offerors shall be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award.  Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov; provide DUNS number; Cage Code and TIN.  

Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the quote submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the quote evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitation will contain a provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  Additionally, FAR clause: 52.204-3 TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION (OCT 1998), is included and is a required part of the quote submission process to ensure that the government is informed of your company Taxpayer Identification number.  Also, DFARS clause 252.247-7022 REPRESENTATION OF EXTENT OF TRANSPORTATION BY SEA (AUG 1992), is a required part of the quote submission process and is included for offerors to acknowledge whether transportation of supplies by sea is anticipated under the resultant contract. 

To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items:  an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.   NOTE:  Any Contractor who is not registered in CCR will NOT get paid.

Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.

The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  

Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under  "Help." 

The following Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) must be submitted with an offerors proposal.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) o Outside the United States.

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that 
(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) 
(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<DESC>Statement of Work
C1.  The Rural Development Electric Program (EP), a division of the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Utilities Service, is experiencing an increased level of interest in financial assistance for the construction of electric generation plants that utilize renewable energy resources.  There is a need for engineering consultant services to evaluate an application for an electric generation plant fueled by woody biomass and organic waste.
C.2   Objectives:
A.	The EP seeks to establish a contract for a period of a base year plus four (4) option years with an expert in biomass fuel-to-electricity conversion generation technology.  This consultant will provide advice that will be used by the agency in its determination of whether or not the agency should issue a long term mortgage loan commitment to finance a 24 MW project located in the southeast region of the country, where the permanent loan will fund after the project, more fully described below, has demonstrated a requisite period of successful operation (the Project).
The EP seeks a consultant to review and authenticate the information submitted to the EP in the application received for the Project.
The EP seeks a consultant to assist the agency in developing appropriate conditions to be met prior to funding a long term loan for the Project.  These conditions will be incorporated in the loan commitment documentation.
The EP seeks a consultant to act as a lender representative in monitoring the construction of the Project.
The EP seeks a consultant to advise the agency as to whether the conditions to funding have been met after the Project has been constructed.
A brief description of the project is as follows below:
C. 3  Background:
The EP mission is to provide reliable and affordable electricity which is essential to the economic well-being and quality of life for all of the nations rural residents.  The EP provides leadership and capital to upgrade, expand, maintain, and replace Americas vast electrical infrastructure.  Under the Authority of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, the EP makes direct loans and loan guarantees to electric utilities to serve customers in rural areas.
The loans and loan guarantees finance the construction of electric distribution, transmission and generation facilities, including system improvements and replacements required to furnish and improve electric service in rural areas, as well as demand side management, energy conservation programs, and on-grid and off-grid renewable energy systems.  Loans are made to corporations, states, territories and subdivisions and agencies such as municipalities, peoples utility districts, and cooperatives, nonprofit, limited dividend, or mutual associations that provide retail electric service needs to rural areas or supply the power needs of distribution borrowers in rural areas.  
The EP promotes the Presidents National Energy Policy and ultimately the nations security by engaging the entrepreneurial spirit of rural America in the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements.  The RE Act authorizes the  use of consultants funded by loan applicants or existing borrowers to facilitate timely action by providing specific engineering and/or fuel assessments and other studies or reports of  applications made to the EP for financial assistance.  See 7 C.F.R.  1789.  
C.4   Scope:
The 24 MW biomass and chicken litter fueled power project is located in the southeast and will be fueled by wood waste originating from the following sources: redirected clean wood waste hauled to a local landfill site, sawmills, and building component industries, pallet mills, grinders, and chipper and independent wood fuel trucker-brokers.  Chicken litter sufficient to comprise up to 20% of the fuel stream would be purchased on the open market within a 50 mile radius.  The project technology will include a refurbished circulating fluidized bed boiler and 100% of the electric output will be sold to an electric cooperative.
Project specific engineering assessments and fuel assessments, as appropriate, may include, but are not limited to, the following: Advising EP concerning obtaining and evaluating supplemental information required for the underwriting process.  Assessment of whether the project will perform as represented with respect to heat rate, availability and emissions. Assessment of the project fuel handling system. Confirmation that the physical characteristics of the fuel supply are consistent with the assumptions underlying the projected output for the project. Reviewing and assessment of the adequacy of plans for overhaul or modification and related cost estimates where the financing involves used equipment. Assessment of whether the hard project costs as represented in the application are reasonably accurate. Review and assessment of the adequacy and appropriateness of the interconnection plan Assessment of whether the plant startup and shakedown contingencies are adequately addressed. Review and assessment of the adequacy of proposed operation and maintenance plans, including scheduled overhauls, over the term of the loan. Assessment of the adequacy of the project staffing plan
Confirmation that ancillary requirements, such as water supply and wastewater discharge, are adequate. Review of the conditions precedent to funding, as developed by EP for a project loan and, based on consultant expertise, suggest appropriate recommendations or additional conditions. Review and assessment of documentation supplied by borrower to determine whether material submitted supports the release of loan funds consistent with conditions precedent to funding. The consultant will be expected to retain a fuel expert who has familiarity with the local fuel supply environment for the Project.  The fuel assessment tasks will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:
The identity of owners of the available and recoverable wood biomass. Assess the availability and cost of recoverable wood biomass fuel within a 100 mile radius of the power plant project. Provide a detailed description of physical characteristics of available recoverable wood biomass fuel, including moisture content. Develop a report of current utilization or disposal of existing recoverable wood biomass, including method and place of disposal and identify the person or company utilizing or disposing existing wood biomass.
A description of existing wood biomass residue collection and processing infrastructure within the study area. Include assessment of whether additional infrastructure will be required and what types of additional infrastructure will be required. Identification of existing or projected competing uses for available recoverable wood biomass fuel within the supply area. Identification of existing facilities competing with this facility for available recoverable wood biomass fuel and an assessment of the potential for additional facilities that will compete with the project. A review of the project developers fuel supply plan
A summary of trends in the local forest product industry, as applicable, that will influence the future availability and price of wood biomass in the project area. A summary of project risks related to fuel quantity and quality, fuel supply infrastructure, fuel price and competition for fuel.  The summary of risks will include an effort to document the longevity and financial health of local paper product industry suppliers, where applicable. The identify of sources for all data reflected in the report

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance.  DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office.  The regional offices are located in San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; Pretoria, South Africa, and Budapest, Hungary.    

The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs).  PRAs serve as the regional team leaders in disaster response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities.  They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional office, as applicable, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Regional Coordinators and the OFDA Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington, the multi-year strategies for their respective regions.  In coordination with OFDA/Washington, PRAs manage disaster response activities, identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions.  

OBJECTIVE

OFDA requires the services of Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) for its regional offices in Bangkok, Thailand, in Budapest, Hungary, and in Kathmandu, Nepal.  It also requires PRAs for offices that would subsequently be established to support OFDAs broadened program strategies or established offices where a PRA vacancy may occur.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

PRAs actively develop and coordinate preparedness, mitigation and training programs to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations to respond and prepare for disasters in affected regions.  Frequent travel within their respective regions/sub-region will be required.

The Principal Regional Advisors responsibilities will include the following:

1) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader in OFDA/Washington (OFDA/W), the PRA will:

	Serve as the DCHA/OFDA lead representative and the primary point of contact on OFDA -related matters in their respective region/sub-region;
	Manage the Regional Office/Sub-Regional Office and supervise all office staff; ensure all staff receive appropriate OFDA training;
	Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and conduct initial assessments of damages and needs; provide representational backstopping support to the DART Team leaders;
	Recommend appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions in consultation with USAID/W; provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of all disaster, humanitarian and emergency events;
	Coordinate and maintain close liaison with representatives of host government, donor governments, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, U.S. Embassy, and USAID missions to ensure efficient and coordinated disaster response activities;
	Monitor OFDA-funded activities, to ensure objectives are being met and constituents are being served; 
	Coordinate the requests, receipt, distribution, tracking, and accounting of relief supplies provided by OFDA;
	Facilitate and coordinate the arrival and departure of DARTs with the U.S. Mission and, as required, serve on DARTs when appropriate; may serve as the DART Leader, as necessary;
	Maintain communications, while on travel, with their respective regional/sub-regional offices and OFDA/W, as necessary; 
	Under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader, coordinate with OFDA/W and other OFDA relevant regional offices, and prepare information requirements and reports;
	Become certified and serve as a Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) for grants, cooperative agreements and contracts under portfolio of responsibility.

2) Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation - Working closely with OFDA/W and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the PRA will assist representatives of host government organizations, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.

Specifically, the PRA, in collaboration with colleagues in OFDA/W regional teams, and under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader in OFDA/W, will: 

	Prepare or supervise the preparation of, regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries;
	Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance for OFDA, USAID, local governments, and other donors/organizations, as appropriate;
	Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID officials on disaster response, mitigation and risk reduction efforts, including the review of sector disaster response and DRM and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) plans;
	Provide support, as required, for other DRM and DRR initiatives in the assigned region.  Support may include assessment visits, project design/evaluation exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;
	In the area of mitigation, work with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries, and develop projects/activities for addressing these;
	Work with local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate mitigation into appropriate programs.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Principal Regional Advisor works under the supervision of, and reports directly to, the Disaster Response Team Leader in OFDA/W.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.  The Disaster Response Team Leader will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.  

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

12.  START DATE:  Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.

13.  POINT OF CONTACT:  See Cover Letter.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

12.1.1 Capability to Perform
12.1.2 Past Performance 
12.1.3 Price 
12.2 Only those offers which are determined by the Contracting Officer to be technically capable of performing under factor 12.1.1 will be further evaluated under factors 12.1.2 and 12.1.3. In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under factor 12.1.1 to be technically acceptable, factor 12.1.2, Past Performance, is slightly more important than factor 12.1.3, Price
12.3 At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with contractors/offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the contractor/offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint

The Contracting Officer will validate contractor/offeror has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract. 
12.4.1 Technical Capability to Perform represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, offers will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the offer to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award
12.4.2 Contractor/Offerors Past Performance information will be used to make a determination of whether the contractor/offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance. Contractor/Offerors should, therefore provide performance history and reference to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contract performed within the past three years.

12.4.2.2 Contractors/Offerors which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any contractor/offerors proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal when compared to the proposals of other contractor/offerors
12.4.2.3 The Contracting Officer will evaluate Contractor/Offerors Past Performance as follows:
12.4.2.3.1 NEUTRAL: No relevant past performance available for evaluation. Contractor/Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience. Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor
12.4.2.3.2 OUTSTANDING: No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon contractor/offerors past performance
12.4.2.3.3 SATISFACTORY: Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the contractors/offerors past performance
12.4.2.3.4 MARGINAL: Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the contractors/offerors past performance.

12.0  EVALUATION
12.1 The government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible contractor/offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers
12.1.1	Capability to Perform
12.1.2	Past Performance 
12.1.3	Price 
12.2	Only those offers which are determined by the Contracting Officer to be technically capable of performing under factor 12.1.1 will be further evaluated under factors 12.1.2 and 12.1.3.  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under factor 12.1.1 to be technically acceptable, factor 12.1.2, Past Performance, is slightly more important than factor 12.1.3, Price
12.3	At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with contractors/offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the contractor/offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint
12.4	By submitting a signed proposal under this solicitation, contractor/offeror asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The Contracting Officer will validate contractor/offeror has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  
12.4.1	Technical Capability to Perform represents minimum acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, offers will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the offer to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award
12.4.2	Contractor/Offerors Past Performance information will be used to make a determination of whether the contractor/offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Contractor/Offerors should, therefore provide performance history and reference to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contract performed within the past three years.
12.4.2.1	Past Performance information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information
12.4.2.2	Contractors/Offerors which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any contractor/offerors proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal when compared to the proposals of other contractor/offerors
12.4.2.3	The Contracting Officer will evaluate Contractor/Offerors Past Performance as follows:
12.4.2.3.1	NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Contractor/Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor
12.4.2.3.2	OUTSTANDING:  No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon contractor/offerors past performance
12.4.2.3.3	SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the contractors/offerors past performance
12.4.2.3.4	MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the contractors/offerors past performance.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance.  DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office.  The regional offices are located in San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; Pretoria, South Africa, and Budapest, Hungary.    

The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs).  PRAs serve as the regional team leaders in disaster response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities.  They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional office, as applicable, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Regional Coordinators and the OFDA Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington, the multi-year strategies for their respective regions.  In coordination with OFDA/Washington, PRAs manage disaster response activities, identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions.  

OBJECTIVE

OFDA requires the services of Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) for its regional offices in Bangkok, Thailand, in Budapest, Hungary, and in Kathmandu, Nepal.  It also requires PRAs for offices that would subsequently be established to support OFDAs broadened program strategies or established offices where a PRA vacancy may occur.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

PRAs actively develop and coordinate preparedness, mitigation and training programs to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations to respond and prepare for disasters in affected regions.  Frequent travel within their respective regions/sub-region will be required.

The Principal Regional Advisors responsibilities will include the following:

1) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader in OFDA/Washington (OFDA/W), the PRA will:

	Serve as the DCHA/OFDA lead representative and the primary point of contact on OFDA -related matters in their respective region/sub-region;
	Manage the Regional Office/Sub-Regional Office and supervise all office staff; ensure all staff receive appropriate OFDA training;
	Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and conduct initial assessments of damages and needs; provide representational backstopping support to the DART Team leaders;
	Recommend appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions in consultation with USAID/W; provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of all disaster, humanitarian and emergency events;
	Coordinate and maintain close liaison with representatives of host government, donor governments, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, U.S. Embassy, and USAID missions to ensure efficient and coordinated disaster response activities;
	Monitor OFDA-funded activities, to ensure objectives are being met and constituents are being served; 
	Coordinate the requests, receipt, distribution, tracking, and accounting of relief supplies provided by OFDA;
	Facilitate and coordinate the arrival and departure of DARTs with the U.S. Mission and, as required, serve on DARTs when appropriate; may serve as the DART Leader, as necessary;
	Maintain communications, while on travel, with their respective regional/sub-regional offices and OFDA/W, as necessary; 
	Under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader, coordinate with OFDA/W and other OFDA relevant regional offices, and prepare information requirements and reports;
	Become certified and serve as a Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) for grants, cooperative agreements and contracts under portfolio of responsibility.

2) Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation - Working closely with OFDA/W and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the PRA will assist representatives of host government organizations, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.

Specifically, the PRA, in collaboration with colleagues in OFDA/W regional teams, and under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader in OFDA/W, will: 

	Prepare or supervise the preparation of, regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries;
	Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance for OFDA, USAID, local governments, and other donors/organizations, as appropriate;
	Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID officials on disaster response, mitigation and risk reduction efforts, including the review of sector disaster response and DRM and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) plans;
	Provide support, as required, for other DRM and DRR initiatives in the assigned region.  Support may include assessment visits, project design/evaluation exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;
	In the area of mitigation, work with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries, and develop projects/activities for addressing these;
	Work with local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate mitigation into appropriate programs.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Principal Regional Advisor works under the supervision of, and reports directly to, the Disaster Response Team Leader in OFDA/W.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.  The Disaster Response Team Leader will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

The objectives of AIT-IV are to provide a state-of-the-art, common, integrated structure for logistics tracking, locating, and monitoring of assets and processes.  In addition, data collection, storage information, information processing, and transmission of AIT data will greatly enhance systems within DoD, USCG, and other Federal Agencies.  AIT technologies will provide standardization among Government users of AIT components purchased from this contract. for state-of-the-art, commercial items needed for automatic identification, data collection, keyless data entry, data processing, data storage, data retrieval, data transmission, and the tracking of assets, including the use of Radio Frequency (RF) technology for users throughout DoD, USCG, contractor purchases in support of DoD, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and other Federal Agencies.  The Government requires software for development (libraries, device drivers, application programming interfaces, and software development tool kits), equipment operating systems, radio frequency transaction management (RF engines), bar code label and form generation, application generation software, application software development kits, and communications.  Associated technical engineering services (and turn-key integration services, systems integration, software development, surveys and installations), instruction and training, warranty, maintenance, documentation, and program management are required. The technologies required by the Government encompass bar code symbologies, contact or touch memory, direct thermal and thermal transfer printing, radio frequency data communications, and future technologies as they are developed.  These future technologies include, but are not limited to, biometrics, systems using satellite communications to relay data and provide position information, cellular telephony, voice recognition, smart labels (combined bar code label and RF transponder), Item Unique Identification (IUID) marking equipment, and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies.  The Government requires equipment with these technologies to support both current and future requirements.  The requirements are for both civilian and military operations worldwide.  The Government requires equipment compliant with open systems standards as described in the Defense Information Standards Registry (DISR).  The Government is contemplating multiple indefinite-delivery-indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) firm-fixed price contracts in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.

<p>AMENDMENT 1 <br />OVERVIEW: This amendment extends the proposal due date and attaches JI-STP documents (3). See files/attachments BAA_RV_08_02 Amendment1, STP Main, JSpOC STP A-1,&nbsp;and JSpOC STP A-2.</p>
<p>
<p><br />ANNOUNCEMENT OVERVIEW</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE: Autonomous Space and Ground Systems for Space Superiority</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER: BAA_RV_08_02</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) NUMBER(S): 12.800 AIR FORCE DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES PROGRAM and 12.910 RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>BRIEF PROGRAM SUMMARY: <strong>This is a 35 day Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit research proposals for the United States Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Spacecraft Component Technology Branch</strong>, which is supporting the advanced decision support and autonomy efforts in Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Command and Control (C2), and Defensive CounterSpace (DCS). The technologies developed under this solicitation will provide affordable and reliable solutions to enable the next generation of Air Force space systems. This effort will require access to classified information up to and including SECRET/NOFORN; therefore, foreign owned firms are precluded from submitting proposals. This acquisition is anticipated to result in multiple awards for contracts or assistance instruments using an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The Government anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) completion type contract for Task 1; it will be issued concurrent with the contract award and will constitute the contract's guaranteed minimum order requirement. The anticipated ordering period for individual award(s) resulting from this BAA is up to 48 months in duration with individual task order period of performance ranging from 18 - 48 months.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND TIME: This BAA will remain open for a period of 35 days from the date of publication. The due date for proposals submitted in response to this BAA is no later than 12:00 p.m. MST on 19 JANUARY 2009. Proposals received after the due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>ESTIMATED PROGRAM COST: Anticipated funding for this BAA (not per contract or award) is: FY09-$1.5M; FY10-$1.5M; FY11-$1.4M; FY12-$1.0M. This funding profile is an estimate only and will not be a contractual obligation for funding. All funding is subject to change due to government discretion and availability. All potential offerors should be aware that due to unforeseen budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: The applicable NAICS code for this announcement is 541712 with a size standard of 500. This acquisition is unrestricted and is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation paragraph 6.102(d)(2) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition In Contracting Act of 1984. There will be no other announcement issued for this requirement. Offerors MUST monitor FedBizOps/EPS http://www.fbo.gov and/or Grants.gov/FIND http://www.grants.gov in the event this announcement is amended. Due to past problems with posting notices to Grants.gov/FIND, offerors are advised to monitor both websites to ensure timely receipt of notifications.</p>
<p>TYPE OF CONTRACTS/INSTRUMENTS: The Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation or Other Transaction (OT) for Prototype, grant, cooperative agreement, or OT for Research. The Air Force may also consider award of an appropriate technology transfer mechanism if applicable. Specific instructions for assistance awards are in paragraph 7 of this BAA. It is anticipated that award under this BAA will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF)/Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) completion contract which requires successful offerors to have an accounting system considered adequate for tracking costs applicable to the contract.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF AWARDS: The Air Force anticipates awarding multiple contracts or assistance instruments. However, the Air Force does reserve the right to make one award or no awards pursuant to this BAA.</p>

<p>Frequency: Background: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auctioned the frequency spectrum previously used by the AGM-130/GBU-15 Weapons System during training operations. As a result, the AGM-130/GBU-15 Data Link Sub-System (Weapon Data Links (WDL). Switchable Data Links (SDL), AXQ-14 Pods, ZSW-1 Pods, and all associated test sets and support equipment must be modified to operate in the new frequencies approved for CONUS training use by the Nation Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Raytheon Indianapolis is the OEM for the WDL, SDL, AXQ-14 &amp; ZSW-1 Pods and associated test sets. Raytheon will modify the Data Link Sub-System to operate in the new CONUS-training frequencies while continuing to operate in the current training /operational frequencies. BAE is the OEM for the AN/GJM-65 Advanced support Equipment (ASE) weapon tester. BAE will modify the ASE to test WDL/SDLs in the two new CONUS frequencies while maintaining the capability to test in the operational frequencies and current training frequencies (OCONUS). Description of Requirement: The third component to Frequency Relocation is the F-15E aircraft integration to support interface with the AXQ-14 Pod, ZSW-1 Pod, WDL/SDLs, 1810-109 tester and the ASE tester. The AGM-130 Program Office requires design review support for each of the components and testers being modified. In addition, the following ICD?s must be modified, GBU-15, AGM-130, AXQ-14 and the ZSW-1. Technical orders will be reviewed and updated to accommodate the changes. System verification support is required in order to prepare test plans &amp; procedures to support aircraft integration and flight test. Sustainment: Description of Requirement: Services provided will consist of three major task areas. These are: 1) Depot service, calibration and repair of selected GBU-15 and AGM-130 module assemblies; 2) Selected engineering Technical services on an approved as required basis; 3) Refurbishment of improved depot factory test equipment. Total Contract Estimate: $15M Note 22 applies</p>

<p>HQ AFCEE<br />Environmental, Construction and Operation &amp; Services (ECOS09) Acquisition<br />Pre-Solicitation Synopsis<br />22 October 2008 <br />THIS IS THE FORMAL PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.204.</p>
<p>The Acquisition and Contracting Division (AFCEE/AC), Brooks City-Base Texas, in support of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) is conducting an acquisition for the Environmental, Construction and Operations &amp; Services 2009 (ECOS09) program. This is a source selection for environmental, construction and operations and services at sites located primarily on DoD (mostly Air Force) installations worldwide with an emphasis on CONUS, for which AFCEE customers have responsibility. ECOS09 is 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Requirements under this contract will primarily support environmental restoration/remediation and operations/services efforts; but requirements may also include traditional minor construction, demolition, and repair. Stand-alone design and conceptual work plan/implementation work plan (CWP/IWP) are NOT included in the scope of this contract. Requirements shall be carried out as specified under TOs at locations worldwide, with emphasis on the Continental United States (CONUS). This is a follow-on contract to the current ECOS contract and is critical to meet AFCEE's future mission and anticipated workload.</p>
<p>Source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements. The contracts are contemplated to be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) pricing arrangements. This requirement is a small business set-aside consisting of approximately five (5) to eight (8) awards and will have a ceiling of $350M. The Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no contracts based on the quality and quantity of the proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 (500 employees or less). This size standard applies for establishment of eligibility as a small business.</p>

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled FL-1 which was posted on11/24/2008. You are notified that the following changes are made: extend the responsedate, additional contact information, and change in the format of the body of thesynopsis.The due date for responses is extended.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  Thesedocuments will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWWbrowser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/DFRC Business Opportunitieshome page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=24  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation andany amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy ofthe solicitation and amendments (if any).DescriptionNASA DFRC, in support of the Agency's human spaceflight programs would like to increasethe Agency's non-critical measurement data per pound and, based on previous programexperiences, improve the flexibility to upgrade, add to or modify instrumentationsystems. NASA intends to become better aware of emerging technologies and architecturesfor human space vehicle flight test and instrumentation for non-critical purposes.  This RFI is intended to identify Low Mass Modular Development Flight InstrumentationSystems (LMMDS) that can provide the capability to optimize the number and quality ofmeasurements made per flight at a reduced life cycle cost as compared to conventionaldata gathering systems.The LMMDS RFI intends to collect information (public and proprietary) on low mass, highlymodular, non-critical flight data gathering and processing technology that could beintegrated into upcoming development tests as well as the operations of future spacevehicles.Development Flight Instrumentation Systems (DFI), as referred to in this RFI, are systemsintended to collect data which is primarily intended for validation of vehicle systems,environments and operations and models/assessments of them.  DFI data may be relied onfor critical analyses/decisions for future flight tests and missions but will not be useddirectly for critical decisions on the mission they fly on.  DFI systems may also bethought of as precursor/prototype systems and their mission performance a validation ortechnology readiness level step towards the system use in more critical applications. Top-level goals, constraints, assumptions and needs:System Performance Goals:-	Maximize total useable data return for validation of vehicle, environment & ops.       -	Minimize total mass and size required to make non-critical measurements. -	Minimize need for power, active cooling, comm or other vehicle resources.-	Minimize integration and operations, unique mods. installation and checkout. -	Minimize ground installation/servicing and mission operations required. -	Minimize life-cycle costs compared to conventional measurement systems. -	Maximize measurement system responsiveness, modularity, interoperability.-	Minimize effort to establish RF, EMI and EMC certification for flight. -	Minimize reliance on single vendors by the use of common standards. -	Minimize need for data transfer and vehicle data storage provisions. -	Maximize reliability/probability of obtaining the desired data. -	Minimize impact to vehicle/crew safety, reliability and mission success.Constraints:-	System/components have very wide scope of capability and application, but mustmeet the functional and environmental requirements uniquely specified for the installedlocation and ground/mission operations period of measurement.  For example, missionduration can be of up to 210 days on orbit.-	Systems must accommodate launch date/window changes. As a target, use up to 4delays over a 3 month period without servicing.-	Launch pad operations must be limited to off-vehicle RF communications atscheduled points.-	Installation/checkout must be performed in parallel with critical path vehicleflow.-	System components, elements and sensors must be located where access is availablefor installation/ground turnaround-	Sensors/measurement systems must meet or exceed data user requirements forcalibration, accuracy, resolution, data rates, etc.-	System/measurements restricted to Criticality 3 uses for mission in flow.-	Systems will not require active cooling or cold plate.Assumptions:-	Vehicle will provide a secondary, non-critical bus that provides:-	Standard interfaces for vehicle power (if needed by LMMDS subsystem/components)-	Two-way data/file transfer/interface (as needed for particularmeasurements/operations)-	Interfaces for ground operations/testing-	Physical access to the bus access points for attachment -	Standard physical interfaces will be provided for attachment of severalindependent systems/subsystems at the bus interface points-	Limited opportunity for data storage on the central instrumentation system-     Wireless LAN exists for non-critical applications on vehicle pressurized cabin-     Vehicle will provide necessary data link from expendable to recoverable vehicle sections or else there will be a tie to a down-link on the expendable-	LMMDS will be certified to be Criticality 3-	Safety Approvals will follow the CSERP (Cx Safety & Engineering Review Panel)process.-	Real time Uplink-Downlink is possible, but not without significant justification-	For most applications, nominal operation will not involve real time uplink ordownlink-	Sensors must be approved by the stake-holder organization(s) as adequate,reliable and comparable to standard calibrated sensors-	Measured data may be stored minimize data transfer is optimal to reducecomplexity and error.Satisfying a Wide Range of Needs:The following section is included to convey that NASA is not looking for a "one size fitsall" system, but rather a suite of compatible systems that range from the very simplestarchitecture to the very sophisticated smart sensors.  It should be noted that we are notlimiting the investigation to those systems containing wireless communications, butrather those that accomplish as many of the Goals within the Constraints and Assumptionslisted. -	Sensor Applications: -	Vehicle systems/structure-	Environments-	Crew/Ops-	Flight Tests/Payloads/possibly experiments -	System Growth:-	Capability to increase the number of sensors or system applications-	Sensor installation interfaces:-	From Non/Velcro to Bond-on/Imbedded-	Sample Rates:-	From very high to very low-	Mission Data transmit needs:-	None to very high (short bursts) -	DAQ Complexity:-	Continuous sample-store to Triggered/Scheduled/Commanded-	Data will have to be recorded either by LMMDS or through interface with vehiclerecording capability -	DAQ Types Supported:-	Passive Tag interrogators to multi-channel systems with synchronization providedby the network of DAQ/Loggers themselves -integrated with or separate from the vehicle-	Sensor type:-	From sensors that could be matured for use in safety critical applications (likeMMOD) to sensors that could support science experiments-	Data Processing/Reduction:-	From none to summary data files to answers at the DAQ-	Data Synchronization:-	Data from LMMDS will be time synchronized as needed-	System life:  -	Ranges from short (e.g. prelaunch/launch events) to long (e.g. contaminationsensing over the life of the vehicle)Technology ObjectivesThis RFI intends to collect information on a variety of applicable technologies, thefollowing list shows some examples of these technologies, but is by no means intended tobe an exhaustive list.	(1)	Micro-size and minimum weight, including connectivity. (2)	Very low power, low maintenance, long-life between servicing.  (3)	Least number of wires/connectors required, including wireless or no connectivity.(4)	Minimum integration and operations to achieve for modularity.(5)	Smart DAQs with User Specifiable calibration, scheduled and even-triggered modes. (6)	Smart DAQs with Processing/Storage allowing reduction of total data transfer. (7)	Robust/Secure Wireless networking and synchronization between DAQs and evenbetween sensor and DAQ.(8)	Plug-and-play wireless interoperability.(9)	Plug-and-play DAQ to avionics integration.(10)	Open architecture standards to promote multiple vendors with competitivesolutions.(11)	Wide variety of data acquisition rates V 1 sample per hour to 1 megasample/sec(12)	Robustness with respect to projected environments. (13)	Wide variety of sensor types, including: temperature, dynamic and quasi-staticacceleration, dynamic and static strain, absolute and dynamic pressure, high rateacoustic pressure, calorimeters, dosimeters, radiometers, shock, air flow, varioushand-held sensors etc.	Clarifications:"Criticality 3" systems [as defined in CxP 70043, Constellation Program Hardware FailureModes and Effects Analysis and Critical Items List (FMEA/CIL) Methodology]-	System nominal installation/operations do not impact the vehicle, flight crew orground operations safety.-	System failure modes and hazards do not impact the vehicle, flight crew or groundoperations safety, or adequate verifiable controls are in place. -	System sensors and components are designed for nominal operational andnon-operational environments as assessed for their installed locations according to userneeds.-	Systems/sensors do not necessarily need to operate through all flight regimes(e.g., some sensors may only need to operate on ascent, while others may only need tooperate on orbit; etc.)-	Systems do not have to survive off-nominal natural or induced environments suchas hard landings, condensation or lightning strike. -	System/sensor reliability, redundancy and end-to-end quality of service isconsistent with comparable "Criticality 3" systems.-	Systems are certified to workmanship standards and parts evaluation results inwarnings and recommendations, not mandated changes unless safety is a concern. "Life Cycle Costs" include expenses incurred from system connectivity as well as thequantity and complexity of the system.	For example, the cost of cabling must address thedesign and installation costs, as well as the maintenance and operation (mass to space)costs; and the costs associated with limited flexibility to grow (the cost of thecomplexity or difficulty of adding, removing or replacing measurements). Costs to theprogram from not obtaining data are real as well, many of these costs are minimized bymeeting the Goals and Constraints of the system as specified above.

<DESC>The Cancer Etiology Branch (CEB) of the National Cancer Institutes (NCI) Division of Cancer Biology (DCB) has a continuing requirement to provide for the synthesis, isolation, purification, and characterization of a number of different research compounds of interest to the carcinogenesis research community.  A majority of these compounds will be synthesized to replace depleted chemical stocks.  New chemicals may be added to meet scientific researchers demand upon approval of the Project Officer.  Chemicals that are currently of interest to the chemical carcinogenesis research community are indicated in the Table at the end of the acquisition plan. Chemicals that have either a low or no demand in the future may be removed from the list.  The contractor will be required to prepare analogs, derivatives and metabolites of compounds within the chemical classes as needed.  Some synthesis will be to replace depleted stocks of chemicals currently carried on the website http://www.NCIRepository.org .

This requirement is part of an ongoing contract research resource collaboration supporting world-side research programs as well as intramural NCI principal investigators.  In the past, over 1,300 chemical carcinogens, chemopreventive agents, chemical biomarkers (DNA and protein adducts), molecular epidemiology standards and chemical metabolites unavailable elsewhere were available for distribution to research through the NCI Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standards Repository program.  Compounds are shipped world-wide.  The level of purity attained by repository suppliers is on the order of 98+% and is guaranteed.  This level of purity is not always available from commercial sources

Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following:

	The Contractor shall prepare compounds by unequivocal methods to produce gram quantities of high purity compounds, which are well-characterized, as specified by the Project Officer;

	The Contractor shall ship properly characterized compounds to the NCI Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository, within 14 calendar days of completion of synthesis, according to labeling, packaging and shipping specifications described in the Statement of Work.  Distribution to the research community will be handled by the NCI Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository Contractor for all compounds.  The Contractor shall be required to provide analytical, handling and storage data with all shipments;

	The Contractor shall perform synthesis, as directed by the Project Officer and presented in the following categories:  a) Re-synthesis; and b) Syntheses of parent derivatives of other carcinogens.  Overall, the Contractor will synthesize 1-5 compounds per month and provide 1-5 grams of each synthesized compound, as determined and directed by the Project Officer;

	The Contractor shall perform necessary chemical characterizations and/or re-purification, as requested by the Project Officer.  In addition, the Contractor shall submit a detailed Quality Control Plan which will provide a process to address and resolve any instance where compounds fall beneath the stated acceptable quality levels (as specified by the Project Officer, but generally 99+% purity).  Inspection and acceptance of compounds will be performed at the NCI Repository.  The Contractor shall submit the Quality Control Plan within 60 calendar days after the start date of the contract; the plan will be reviewed for approval by the Project Officer prior to its acceptance;

	The Contractor shall prepare and submit a Transfer/Phase-Out plan to the Project Officer sixty days prior to the expiration date of the contract, in the event that the project is re-competed and the successor award is not made to the incumbent Contractor.

This is a re-competition of a previous requirement and the Government anticipates that one (1) cost-reimbursement, cost-plus-fixed-fee type contract will be awarded for a period of one (1) base year with the possibility of the Government exercising up to three (3) additional option periods/years.  The anticipated solicitation issue date is approximately on or around January 15, 2009, and proposals will be due approximately 30 calendar days after the solicitation issue date.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Office of Acquisitions (OA), NCI, at the following url:  http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/appl/rfp/published_rfps.jsp .  IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.  The NAICS Code is 541380 with a size standard of $12,000,000 per annum.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  Point of contact is John R. Manouelian; electronic mail address:
manouelj@mail.nih.gov ; telephone: 301-435-3813; fax:  301-402-6699.  Collect calls will NOT be accepted.

<DESC>The DoD Joint Project Manager for Decontamination (JPM-Decon) is conducting a market survey to identify chemical and biological decontaminants that meet the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM) civilian related chemical warfare agent exposure levels for chemical and biological defense.  The JPM-Decon Program Office requests information on decontaminants with chemical efficacy comparable or superior to current decontaminants (e.g. HTH, STB, DF-200), and which have a reduced logistical burden, and are compatible with current applicator systems (specifically JSTDS-SS) and common military materials (i.e. CARC, metals, plastic, and rubber).  JPM-Decon is only interested in decontaminants that are commercially available.<BR><BR>Information received as a result of this RFI will be evaluated by JPM-Decon and may lead to procurement of selected candidates for evaluation and assessment using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) as specified in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).<BR><BR>Decontaminants proposed in response to this RFI will be evaluated according to evaluation criteria that can be downloaded at https://www3.natick.army.mil/upcoming.cfm.  Selected decontaminant solutions will undergo phased qualification testing and evaluation by the Government.  All procurements by the Government for this activity are planned to be conducted using SAP.      <BR><BR>Sources interested in being considered for this effort are requested to download and complete the Future Decontaminant questionnaire which can be found at https://www3.natick.army.mil/upcoming.cfm and provide additional documents as specified, to explain the capabilities of the decontaminant.  Please pay special attention to the list of Mandatory Documents that will be used to substantiate responses to this questionnaire.  The questionnaire covers technical performance, JSTDS-SS compatibility and logistical parameters for the decontaminant.<BR>This RFI may be used to procure products to undergo independent Government evaluation for future production.  This is not a developmental effort.  All solicitors must provide evidence that their decontaminant product meets commercial standards.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Responses to this RFI are not offers for contract and will not be used by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Vendors having products that they believe would be suitable for military decontamination operations as described herein shall submit hard copies and/or an electronic copy of the attached questionnaire and other documentation deemed appropriate.   No telephonic responses will be considered.<BR><BR>Interested parties shall submit information directly to the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Director of Programs - Victor Murphy, victor.murphy@usmc.mil ; (703) 617-2413, by February 16, 2008.  <BR><BR>An Industry Day for Decontaminants to discuss this RFI, questionnaire, draft decontaminant evaluation criteria and the Governments planned acquisition strategy is scheduled for January 13, 2008.  Details are provided in the Industry Day Conference Announcement for Future Decontaminants, Solicitation Number: W911QY09RDFOS, posted on January 2, 2009.
