<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Delaware Academy of Medicine, Wilmington, DE, to develop a statewide virtual reference service prototype to disseminate health law information to the public.   The Specialized Information Services Division (SIS) of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) seeks to develop a public health law clearinghouse and database that will contain a collection of relevant and useful public health legal information, including statutes, regulations, judicial decisions, executive orders, official opinions, and agency guidance materials from federal, state, tribal, local, and international sources.  The collection also will contain pertinent scholarly articles, policy papers, and expert analyses of public health law issues from academia, public policy organizations, peer review journals, and other sources.  The specific purpose of this effort is to determine the feasibility and desirability of constructing a comprehensive Delaware Public Health Law database in the public domain for individuals, members of the public health profession, and members of the legal profession that may ultimately serve as a model for each state.    

This project represents a cooperative venture between the National Library of Medicine, the State of Delaware, the Delaware Academy of Medicine, and the Widener University School of Law.  This collaboration will build on the software, hardware, database, and web design expertise developed at NLM over the past ten years.  The following tasks will be accomplished:  1)Transmission of selected XML files from the Delaware Government Information Center to servers managed by the Division of Specialized Information Services at the National Library of Medicine; 2) Configuration of portal and database access, and development of system interface layouts and navigation schemes by NLM-SIS staff; 3) Acquisition, assembly, and analysis of relevant constitutions, statutes, treaties, regulations, and court decisions by students and faculty at the Widener University School of Law.   At the conclusion of the pilot implementation, contents of the searchable PHLIP database (including Delaware statutes, regulations, court decisions, and other legal materials) will be installed and made publicly available from servers at the National Library of Medicine. 

The proposed contractor provides a unique environment for success of this project based on the following types of organizational expertise: 1) The Delaware legislature has implemented information technology that allows DE statutes and regulations to be updated and transmitted in real time via XML files.  The Delaware Government Information Center, the Delaware Registrar of Regulations, and the Delaware Division of Libraries have documented experience and professional expertise in full-text and relational database implementation, software and hardware development, internet security, web server and database retrieval, and application design and development; 2) The Delaware Academy of Medicine, is the largest and oldest health library in the state, and has served as a fiduciary agent for various health-related multi-organizational projects within the state of Delaware; 3) The Widener University School of Law, the only law school in the state of Delaware, supports an internationally renowned institute of health law that offers several advanced degrees (e.g., L.L.M., M.J., S.J.D., D.L.).  Faculty and students at Widener have access to state-of-the-art computer facilities that fully support electronic legal analysis, writing, and publication, as well as on-line creation of content for the PHLIP database.   The geographic proximity and the close, long-standing working relationships of the collaborating organizations, combined with the progressive and inventive electronic information environments of NLM and the Delaware state government, provides the unique combination of skills, knowledge, experience, and informatics infrastructure required for successful completion of this pilot public health legal information project.

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.    The period of performance is one year from the effective date with one additional option year.   This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.    The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional services as specified above.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria:  Criterion #1:    Extensive experience with digitization, formatting, and web presentation of legal materials in the public domain, including constitutions, statutes, regulations, court decisions, and other government documents at the local, state, federal, and international levels (25%).  Criterion #2:    Evidence of knowledge of, and operational familiarity with, products and services of the National Library of Medicine and its Division of Specialized Information Services, including an understanding of public health information science, potential users of electronic public health information, and experience in the integration of public health legal information with other types of medical and health information (25%).   Criteria #3:      Extensive experience in public health legal research, analysis, writing, teaching, editing, and communication, especially in electronic environments.  Ability to assemble, organize, analyze, and disseminate a variety of legal materials in electronic environments for use in the public domain (30%).   Criteria #4:      Evidence of capacity to timely and effectively collaborate and communicate with governmental agencies and private organizations in electronic information environments, especially the environments of law schools, government information agencies, law libraries, and medical libraries (20%).

Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.     Proposal must include pricing information.     NLM synopsis No.04-229/KS shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.     Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Kala Shankar, Contract Specialist on (301) 496 6546.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), South Carolina District has a requirement for a non-competitive award for "Total Mercury" and "Methyl Mercury" analyses.  This project is being done in cooperation with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SC DHEC).   Data-quality objectives and analytical requirements for this project are that the contract laboratory has met the FY 2004 requirements for National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation (NELAC) approval of low-level mercury and methyl mercury methods based on detection limit, precision, and accuracy described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) method 1630 (low-level methyl mercury) and method 1631 (low-level mercury) in sediment.  Because of late project start up and immediate project end date (9/30/2004), the contract laboratory should currently meet the requirements of the Laboratory Evaluation Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Branch of Quality Systems (BQS) and be listed as approved in FY 2004 to allow the entry of the analytical results into the USGS National Water Information System.  Frontier Geoscience Inc. is the only laboratory currently meeting the above requirements. The USGS anticipates awarding this to Frontier Geoscience, Inc. on or about September 2, 2004.  NAICS Code is 541690.   Questions pertaining to this announcement and it's current requirement ONLY shall be submitted via e-mail to:  scstephens@usgs.gov by 9/1/2004.  THE SUBJECT LINE OF ALL EMAILS  MUST CONTAIN THE WORDS "04ER20-NoSolicitation"  No additional synopsis will be published. Analytical laboratories interested in bidding for future projects requiring low-level mercury and methyl mercury analysis in water and sediment should meet the above method and approval requirements.  Guidance for NELAC approval is provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (http://www.epa.gov/nerlesd1/land-sci/nelac/index.html). Guidance on applying to the USGS BQS for verification and listing as a NELAC-approved laboratory for the analytes of interest (low-level total mercury and methyl mercury) is provided at the following web site: http://bqs.usgs.gov/lep/ and described below: For a LABORATORY to be approved by USGS:  1. If a laboratory is NELAC certified, the USGS requirements for general documentation are satisfied and the laboratory is approved providing:  a.         The laboratory is certified for similar analyses as those of interest to the USGS;  b.         The list of deficiencies found by the NELAC accrediting authority is either resolved or in an acceptable state to the USGS; and  c.         There have been no significant changes in performance or operation that would change any previous findings.  2. To verify that the laboratory of interest is acceptable to USGS, we will require an amended list of documents for laboratory approval. a.   The complete NELAC deficiency log from the NELAC on-site laboratory inspection. Include the laboratory response and corrective actions report.  b.   The NELAC proficiency sample results for at least two consecutive test periods.  c.   The requested analytes and concentrations ranges that need to be covered for the USGS project.  d.   SOPs of analyses for which the laboratory is NOT NELAC accredited.  For approval of SPECIFIC ANALYTES from a USGS approved Laboratory:  1.   Approval for specific analytes are USGS approved if they are NELAC accredited under the correct program.  a.   NELAC accreditation can be under either the Clean Water Act (CWA) or the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) for USGS approval.  b.   USGS cannot accept accreditation under the CAA (Clean Air Act) for water samples.  c.   USGS cannot accept accreditation under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA - commonly known as Superfund) for USGS analyses at ambient concentrations unless the ability to provide appropriate results in the expected concentration range and the appropriate matrix is proven.  2.   For NELAC accredited Inorganic analyses, participation in the USGS standard reference (SRS) project is still required.  3.   For NELAC accredited Organic, Radiochemical, Physical Measurements, and Biological analyses, participation in the USGS standard reference (SRS) project is not required if proficiency test samples are acceptably analyzed.  4.   If a laboratory has NELAC accreditation and USGS requires proof of proficiency for analytes that are not within the scope of its NELAC accreditation, the laboratory must provide appropriate SOPs to the USGS, and prove that these other analyses remain under the general Quality System accredited by NELAC audit.  Once a laboratory is approved by USGS, the specific analytes of interest must remain in an acceptable status as determined by performance on SRS and/or appropriate proficiency test samples. NELAC laboratory approvals are based on a 12-month period, and must be maintained in order to extend beyond 12 months.  USGS approvals are good for three years or until NELAC accreditation is revoked or performance is unacceptable and deemed irreparable in an appropriate time frame.  USEPA, 1996, Method 1631: Mercury in water by oxidation, purge and trap, and cold vapor atomic fluorescence (CVAFS). EPA 821-R-96-012 USEPA, 1997, Method 1630: Methyl mercury in water by distillation,aqueous ethylation, purge and trap, and cold vapor atomic fluorescence (CVAFS). Draft method.

Space offered must have potential for efficient layout, e.g., space should not exceed a length to width ratio of 2:1 nor be “U” or “L” shaped.  No atriums or other areas interrupting contiguous space; no extremely long narrow runs of space; no irregular space configurations or other unusual building features adversely affecting usage will be considered.   Space should be located on top floor of buildings offered with roof accessibility for antenna purposes with no overshadowing buildings in the immediate area.  Reasons for building rejections are, but not limited to:  If any single continuously radiating transmitter produces a field strength over the site exceeding 50 mV/m; the root-sum-square of the field strength from continuously radiating transmitters in any 30 MHz-wide portion of the radio spectrum exceed 300 mV/m; signals from fixed transmitters produce spurious emissions or measurable desensitization in receivers, which results in impaired monitoring ability in the public safety, marine, or aviation bands; tall, overshadowing buildings within 1/4 mile radius impair monitoring ability or direction finding in the public safety, marine or aviation bands.  The Government requires a fully serviced lease with adequate parking for clientele on site in accordance with local code.  Parking is required for 8 employees plus 4 reserved, secured spaces on site.  Preference is for employee parking to be in the same building as the office.

<DESC>The 15th Contracting Squadron (15 CONS), Hickam AFB Hawaii, intends to award a competitive Small Business 8(a) set-aside contract. This effort will be awarded as a Firm-Fixed Price contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The base period of the contract is expected to begin on or about 01 October 2004. A Solicitation will be posted on or about 20 April 2004. The requirement is to provide project/network management support of the Hickam Base Area Network (HBAN) and Classified Base Area Network (CBAN) for system operations and maintenance of the Hickam AFB Local Area Network (LAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) infrastructure of the remote management and administration of the Pacific Air Forces Commander for the Pacific Air Forces (PACAFs) Enterprise of Responsibility (EOR).  The scope of this requirement also includes help desk/event management operations for the PACAF EOR.  In addition, this requirement covers travel to support remote site (theater bases) locations, as required.  The Hickam AFB LAN, MAN, and WAN supports HQ PACAF and the 15th Air Base Wing totaling over 6,000 users.  The majority of Hickam network communications are accomplished over Non-Secure IP Router Network (NIPRNET) and the Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNET).  The major communications systems making up the operational network within HQ PACAF can be broken into file, print, messaging, TCP/IP, and management services.  File servers provide users with network accessible data storage space for both personal uses and for information dissemination.  Print services allow for the sharing of print devices among users in the office or the entire network.  Print sharing permits the amortization of a more expensive, high speed, quality printer over many users.  Messaging is the most used and critical service on the network, and is combined with appointment and tasking applications.  TCP/IP Services include web, net news, file transfer, and remote terminal access applications.  All PACAF EOR bases supported by the NOSC have similar operations, although these vary in size between 1,000 and 7,000 users at each location.  There are over 40,000 users in the PACAF EOR. Funds are not currently available for this acquisition; therefore, the solicitation will be issued under FAR clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 (21 million). Once available, this solicitation must be downloaded from www.eps.gov, as no paper copies will be issued. All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the solicitation. The Government contemplates award of this requirement on or about 15 August 2004, with a performance start date of 01 October 2004.  The successful Offeror will be required to have a Top-Secret Clearance. This notice serves as preliminary information and does not obligate the government to award a contract, restrict the government in its ultimate acquisition approach, or obligate the government to pay for proposal cost. A DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) is attached for industry comments. For any questions/comments please contact (via e-mail preferred) the POC listed below.

<DESC>Current Architecture: The current ALERT application is a n-tiered server architecture that operates on Proliant 8500 servers using the Windows 2000 operating system and Sybase database system software.  The application software is programmed using Delphi.  There are four main software components 
¨	The ALERT analysis software includes specific scans that target certain suspect patterns of fraudulent activity.  ALERT utilizes data from two sources; transaction data that is received from the states operation EBT systems, and retailer data that is extracted from present mainframe systems that house the FNS national retailer database for authorizing and monitoring participating Food Stamp retailers.
¨	A web site provides user information on existing releases, tutorials and a data mart known as AMART.  
¨	ESSRA is a component which provides retailer management data that has been extracted weekly from the FNS national retailer tracking database.  ESSRA is used in the field and regional offices to manage daily retailer authorization activities and allows users to download data into standard Excel spreadsheets or Access tables for further manipulation 
¨	Watchlist is a management reporting tool designed to systemically track identified suspect retailers and the status of activities by FNS staff regarding each identified retailer.  

FNS’ overall system environment is transitioning from mainframe to server and web-based technologies.  Current software standards require Section 508 compliance for all agency systems.  FNS is planning to migrate the present ALERT database system to SQL Server 2000 prior to the commencement of the new base contract.  Users are provided Windows 2000 and Office Suite products on their workstations or laptops installed with the ALERT application software.  Depending on access to the Department Wide Area Network, users connect via the WAN or utilize dial-in capabilities.  A limited number of users are able to access the ALERT system using Virtual Private Networks (VPN) for secured connections via the Internet, which we expect to grow in the next few years as the preferred method for remote access.  

Background: ALERT is a decision support management system built around the retailer management and compliance requirements of the Food Stamp Program.  The primary purpose is to load and analyze food stamp transactional data, e.g., food stamp purchases in any of 150,000 authorized food stamp retailer locations.  Data is submitted to FNS by State EBT processors each month.   Only a few States remain to be implemented, the largest being California.  Current data on the status of EBT State activities is available on the FNS website athttp://www.fns.usda.gov/fsp/ebt/.    At present, there are nearly 70 million transactions processed monthly and a rolling 6 months of data is maintained on-line.  When all states have implemented EBT, monthly transaction data is estimated to be about 85 million transactions.  Key elements of each electronic transaction are extracted by the EBT processors and provided to the ALERT system.  This data includes information such as dollar amount, location, terminal ID, date and time of the transaction, type of entry (card swiped through a reader or manually key–entered), and whether a paper voucher was issued.
This acquisition is for the maintenance and upkeep of the system, as well as possible enhancements that may arise.  The contract is full and open to all sources, will have a base period of one year with four (4) one (1) year option periods, and will be a combination of fixed price and IDIQ.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about March 1, 2004.  Please, NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES.

<DESC>This is a notification of intent to procure on a sole source basis with Fair Isaac Corporation consulting services in the research and development of a proof-of-concept model using the Blaze Advisor rules management software.  The proof-of-concept model is to be used to evaluate the extended capabilities of the software.  In addition, it will be used to support the development and deployment of business rules to enhance the identification of potential non-compliant tax returns for audits. As part of this prototyping effort, Fair Isaac Corporation will provide technical experts, a limited right-to-use license, and a copy of the Blaze Advisor software for prototyping.  The proof-of-concept model will be delivered on a stand alone portable computing platform capable of demonstrating the necessary functionality required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The IRS recently conducted a Market Analysis and concluded that the Blaze Advisor software would best meet their requirements.  The Internal Revenue Service has already acquired an unlimited rights license for the use of the Blaze Advisor software for a separate application.  The Blaze Advisor software is proprietary.  Any other software is not compatible in this application.  The expected date of award is August 31, 2004.  No award will be made on the basis of any quotations/proposals or other information received in response to this notification since this is a notification of intent to acquire and not a request for proposals.

<CONTACT>MATTHEW J. GROWNEY, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2029, E-Mail: growney.matthew@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. EPA has a requirement for the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ).  OTAQ has responsibilities under the Clean Air Act (CAA) which include setting emission standards for on- and off-highway motor vehicles /engines and assuring compliance with such standards; characterizing emissions and fuel consumption characteristics of current and prototype on- and off-highway motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines; and assessing the effectiveness and cost of current or potential future motor vehicle emission control systems. Additional OTAQ responsibilities include regulating motor vehicle fuels and fuel additives (F/FA) and assessing the emissions characteristics of current or potential future motor vehicle F/FA. The objective of this solicitation is to provide OTAQ with flexible testing and related analytical support for emissions characterization, technology assessment and test procedure and/or equipment development. This requirement encompasses measurement of regulated/unregulated emissions and fuel consumption for a wide variety of highway and non-highway vehicles/engines operating on all types of conventional, reformulated and alternative fuels. Testing requirements apply to vehicles/engines operating in both laboratory and real-world environments.   Related analytical support requirements include statistical or other analysis and/or modeling of emissions and other data to determine air quality, health, welfare and safety effects associated with compliance with new emission standards or other applicable CAA provisions. Other related requirements include chemical or other analyses of F/FA and development/evaluation of test protocols for F/FA and their combustion and evaporative products. Also included is analysis/modeling of the effects of changes in F/FA formulations on emissions, emission control systems and on fuel production and distribution systems. Technical support to EPA design and evaluation of prototype vehicle emission-control and propulsion systems and related control, data acquisition and sampling systems will also be required.   Significant potential exists for conflicts of interest (COI) under this procurement.  Therefore, it is considered in the best interest of the Government to preclude from award consideration as a prime contractor or subcontractor, all motor vehicle or engine/non-road engine manufacturers and fuels and/or fuel additives producers.  Furthermore, all offerors will be required to submit a COI plan requiring them to identify the projects they are working on and explain how potential or actual Organizational Conflicts of Interests can be either mitigated, avoided, or neutralized. The solicitation will contain the following provision, "Prohibition of Motor Vehicle or Engine/Non-Road Engine Manufacturers and Fuels and Fuels and/or Fuel Additives Producers from Being Considered Eligible for Award."  The text of this clause will be as follows: 	"Whereas the purpose of this contract is to provide support for the development of regulations directly affecting the motor vehicle or engine/non-road engine manufacturing, and fuel and fuel additive producers, the Contracting Officer has determined that a significant potential for an actual or potential COI will result.  Therefore, any manufacturers of motor vehicles or engine/non-road engines and fuel and fuel additive producers will be considered ineligible for award of any contract resulting from this solicitation.  The specific determination whether any other offeror is to be considered ineligible for award will be made by the Agency on a case by case basis." The solicitation and resulting contract shall also contain the clause, "Limitation on Future Contracting."  The text of this clause will track with Limitation of Future Contracting, Alternative V (Headquarters Support), EPAAR 1552.209-74 (MAY 1994), except for paragraph (c).  Paragraph (c) of the clause shall read as follows: 	"Paragraph c:   Unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer, the Contractor agrees not to enter into a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to the specific activities performed under this contract.  Specifically, enter into contracts or represent motor vehicle or engine/non-road engine manufacturers and fuels and /or fuel additives producers that are affected by the policy and regulations generated from this contract if the purpose is to shield or protect the company from adhering to EPA's regulations or policies.  These restrictions apply during the life of the contract." The Government anticipates award of a cost plus fixed fee term (LOE) contract with a twelve-month base term and four (4) twelve month options to extend the term.  The base level of effort for each term will consist of 4,250 direct labor hours. The Government anticipates including quantity option amounts of 200% for the Base and the option periods, which brings the maximum total potential on the contract to 63,750 direct labor hours over five (5) years. The solicitation is subject to full and open competition, all responsible offerors may submit a proposal.  Copies of the solicitation will be available to all offerors on the Internet.  Offerors should visit EPA's Home Page (http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd) for continuous update of RFP's status.  No RFP release date and closure have yet been established.  Anticipated release is October 2004.  The NAICS code is 541330.

The Genetics Branch, CCR supports extramural and private initiatives for structural characterization of cancers and derived cancer cell lines by “conventional” sequencing to more fully - 1) build a foundation of datasets representing the elucidation of the genome anatomy for selected tumors, cell lines, and cell lineages, 2) integrate these datasets with data on gene expression, morphology, virulence, and other phenotypic parameters 3) use the foundation of this initial work for the formulation of testable hypotheses concerning required steps in the development and progression of cancer, lineage specific mechanisms of instability, genotype-phenotype relationships, and the basis of evolutionary selection or programmatic choice. The Genetics Branch will develop appropriate computerized screening algorithms to allow for the extraction of sequences of interest from the anticipated one million or more sequences that will be generated.  In brief, the screening process for sequences of interest (i.e. those whose two ends are further away from each other than the size of the average BAC clone from the library +/- 3SD) is to develop four categories of clones: 1) those whose ends are consistent with contiguity of the human genome sequence. 2) those whose two ends appear to be discontinuous compared to the human genome sequence and for which have more than one independent example where the two novel genomic regions are juxtaposed.  3) those where only one example of a novel juxtaposition but have additional molecular cytogenetic data to support this novel juxtaposition, and 4) those which have only one example of a novel juxtaposition .   The Genetics Branch, CCR requires the services of the staff at the Children’s Hospital of Oakland for the preparation of the BAC Library for cell line SKACL that are a prerequisite for this project.  The Children’s Hospital of Oakland are the only sources known to the NCI with that can furnish the BAC library which is the foundation for the Human Genome Sequencing Project that has been tested in terms of quality assurance and quality control.  However, if any interested party believes that it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail with the necessary documentation to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and two copies of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 P.M. EDT, on September 13, 2004.  All questions should be directed to Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on 301-402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This requirement is being procured based on FAR 13 the use of simplified acquisition procedures.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $10.0M.  Please reference solicitation number RFQ-NCI-40142-NQ.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The US EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.301, with Battelle Memorial Institute Pacific Northwest Division.  This requirement is to develop microarray chips for detecting 6 pathogenic bacteria present in environmental water samples. The chips developed will be validated using pure cultures of bacteria and spiked and unspiked field samples. In 1998 the US EPA listed Aeromonas, Helicobacter pylori and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) on the Contaminant Candidate List (CCL) for regulatory considerations under the 1996 Amendments  to the Safe Drinking Water act.  These bacteria were place on the CCL occurrence priority list which meant that occurrence information was needed on them.  Existing methods for the detection and identification of pathogenic strains for each of these species are mostly laboratory assays and field  samples that need to be tested before occurrence studies can be done.  In addition, other bacteria such as E. coli 0157:H7, Shigella and Salmonelle spp., which are not on the CCL, also pose substantial risk to human health. Therefore a method that has the potential to detect several bacteria and  also identify the pathogenic strains at the same time would be of great value.  DNA oligonucleotide microarray offer the potential to simultaneously detect any organism of interest in a water sample and is needed for this study. The following tasks shall be achieved : 1) prepare microarray chips;  2) begin validation of chips with pure cultures; 3) begin validation of chips with spiked and unspiked surface water and  4) deliver chips and prepare report. This is not a request for proposal.  Sources that would like to be considered must submit documentation within 15 days of the date of this  posting.  Submit your request for consideration in writing to Renita Tyus by email: tyus.renita@epa.gov or fax at (513) 487-2115.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to negotiate on a soles source basis with CIIT Centers for Health Research to provide professional services to utilize existing anatomically accurate insprired air flow models of individual human nasal tract regions to evaluate the influence of anatomy on inhalation dosimetry .  Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), which allows for negotiation without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source.   The basis for this determination is that the  U.S. EPA-National Center for Environmental Assessment in Research Triangle Park has a requirement to obtain a report on the project titled, "Intra-human variability in inhalation dosimetry."  This project requires the expertise in the highly specialized area of application of inhalation dosimetry  in the respiratory tract to address issues of both interspecies extrapolation and intra-human variability. CIIT Centers for Health Research has access to unique and sophisticated models describing inspired air flow in areas of the respiratory tract relevant for risk assessment. These models  represent a unique opportunity to explore the extent and significance of human-to-human-to-animal variability and are essential to this project.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to  the requirement by submitting documentation to Kimberli Irwin at the office identified above, by fax (513)487-2019 or by e-mail (irwin.kimberli@epa.gov) which establishes that their specifications meet the EPA's requirement.  Documentation must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of  publication of this synopsis to be considered by the EPA.

Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

<DESC>The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) attends to award on a sole source basis a delivery order to The Gallup Organization, 901 F Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20004. The Gallup Organization will  conduct for BJS an International Crime Victimization Survey and deliver the data set to the designated audience upon completion.  This data set will be produced by an international survey and a random survey of 2,000 households that will be interviewed in the United States about experiences (if any) with assault, sexual assault, robbery, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft during the last 12 months.  The Gallup Organization survey produces the only statistics on crime and crime rates that are genuinely comparable from one country to another.  This endeavor to measure crime across countries has the support of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.  Analyses of data from previous surveys have been published in academic books and have been presented in papers given at national and international criminological meetings.  The Bureau of Justice Statistics will use the data from this survey to compare experiences of crime in the United States with those of more than 30 other countries.  At no time, either during the four previous ICVS projects (conducted by INTEVIEWNSS, a company that is no longer in business), or during the period that Gallup Organization has engaged in the activities for the 2004 version, has any other entity produced any statistics on victimization that could be used to compare countries with each other.  The Gallup Organization is internationally recognized as the sole source of this information.  Attempts on the part of the United States to obtain equivalent data from other sources would not be either futile and  would probably cost in the millions.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) plans to procure on a sole source basis with MD Anderson Cancer Center, National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project and the Mayo Clinic Rochester to develop the study design of 18q LOH assay comparability.  CDP has overall responsibility for planning, evaluation and coordination of NCI-supported research related to development of diagnostics for cancer.  The CDP’s Program for the Assessment of Clinical Cancer Tests (PACCT) was established to ensure the efficient and effective translation of knowledge and technology into clinical practice.  A critical part of that effort is the evaluation of clinical utility of diagnostic tests and the optimization of these tests.  This requires large numbers of specimens, from patients in randomized controlled trials.  One focus of the PACCT action plan developed in April 2002 is developing tests that can help optimize care for patients with early stage colon cancer.  These awards will be used to support accessioning of specimens from clinical trials; assaying by at least two techniques the loss of heterozygosity of a region of the long arm of chromosome 18 in these samples; analyzing the results to determine which technique correlates best with disease-free survival; and then testing the inter- and intra-laboratory variability of the assay protocol.  The specimens will be accessioned from the NCI Clinical Cooperative Groups colon cancer trials in which MD Anderson Cancer Center, NSABP and Mayo Clinic Rochester were each the lead contractor for one of the three Cooperative Groups. The lead contractor for any Group of an intergroup trial is responsible for collecting all the specimens for that trial.  Therefore, there are no other contractors that can provide the requisite specimens.  These contractors have led other colon cancer trials and may need to draw on the specimens collected in those trials.  These contractors also have the patient data necessary for the correlation of assay results with other clinical parameters and outcome.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 10,  2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NAICS 541990, size standard 6M.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>DESC: This modification is issued to provide additional information for the requirement and extend the time for response until September 3, 2004.  The Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), plans to award a sole source procurement to DK Shifflet & Associates to provide data for the travel and tourism satellite accounts.  It is in best interest of BEA to use the same vendor since the vendor was instrumental at the inception of these satellite accounts. D.K. Shiflett & Associates is the only known source that produces these data with the frequency, quantity, and quality BEA needs to produce the travel and tourism satellite accounts.  In order to maintain consistency and comparability of the data—which is crucial since BEA produces the travel and tourism satellite accounts in order to show changes in spending on travel and tourism over time—it is necessary to continue to use DK Shifflet’s data.  The award will be made under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   

BEA is updating the TTSA’s for calendar year 2003.   BEA is seeking the same set of data that was supplied by the incumbent contractor to create the 1997-2002 TTSA’s for calendar year 2003.  The primary goal is to secure the best, most comprehensive data as appropriate inputs consistent with the data provided to BEA for the past six years for the TTSA’s.  To improve the estimates of the TTSA’s and update the TTSA’s for 2003, BEA needs:

-	Better measure of travel and tourism expenditures in total and by type of traveler for both domestic and overseas travel.
-	Data on the amount of automobile usage to include within the TTSA’s.  This includes not only the gasoline and related “out-of-pocket” expenditures centered around the automobile, but also inclusion of a portion of the purchase price of an automobile with the TTSA as a durable good purchase and other related expenses.
_	Data on the rents imputed rents from vacation (2nd) homes.  Imputed rents are relatively standard within the system of national accounts framework, but difficult to apply within the TTSA framework due to lack of government data.
-	High quality data collected directly from travelers on their expenditures.  The collection of these data should be based on sound statistical sampling techniques and methodology.  These are no public sources of data on these expenditures.

Documents and reference material provided to the contractor are IED Best Data Handling Standards (See Attachment A below).

All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirement.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirement.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later that 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing, or by sending an e-mail to amy.sanderswhite@noaa.gov.  Reference Solicitation BA153720-4-00051.

<DESC>The 15th Contracting Squadron (15 CONS), Hickam AFB Hawaii, has issued a solicitation Request for Proposals (RFP), with all attachments only available from the Electonic Posting System at http://www.eps.gov/, and intends to award a competitive Small Business 8(a) set-aside contract. This effort will be awarded as a Firm-Fixed Price contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The base period of the contract is expected to begin on or about 01 October 2004. The requirement is to provide project/network management support of the Hickam Base Area Network (HBAN) and Classified Base Area Network (CBAN) for system operations and maintenance of the Hickam AFB Local Area Network (LAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) infrastructure of the remote management and administration of the Pacific Air Forces Commander for the Pacific Air Forces (PACAFs) Enterprise of Responsibility (EOR).  The scope of this requirement also includes help desk/event management operations for the PACAF EOR.  In addition, this requirement covers travel to support remote site (theater bases) locations, as required.  The Hickam AFB LAN, MAN, and WAN supports HQ PACAF and the 15th Air Base Wing totaling over 6,000 users.  The majority of Hickam network communications are accomplished over Non-Secure IP Router Network (NIPRNET) and the Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNET).  The major communications systems making up the operational network within HQ PACAF can be broken into file, print, messaging, TCP/IP, and management services.  File servers provide users with network accessible data storage space for both personal uses and for information dissemination.  Print services allow for the sharing of print devices among users in the office or the entire network.  Print sharing permits the amortization of a more expensive, high speed, quality printer over many users.  Messaging is the most used and critical service on the network, and is combined with appointment and tasking applications.  TCP/IP Services include web, net news, file transfer, and remote terminal access applications.  All PACAF EOR bases supported by the NOSC have similar operations, although these vary in size between 1,000 and 7,000 users at each location.  There are over 40,000 users in the PACAF EOR. Funds are not currently available for this acquisition; therefore, the solicitation will be issued under FAR clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 (21 million). This solicitation must be downloaded from www.eps.gov, as no paper copies will be issued. All information required for submission of an offer are identified in the solicitation. The Government contemplates award of this requirement on or about 15 August 2004, with a performance start date of 01 October 2004.  The successful Offeror will be required to have a Top-Secret Clearance. This notice serves as information only and does not obligate the government to award a contract, restrict the government in its ultimate acquisition approach, or obligate the government to pay for proposal cost. The Statement of Work (SOW), Work Allocation Table, DD Form 254, and Past Performance Questionnare are attached for industry comments. For any questions/comments please contact (via e-mail preferred) one of the POC(s) listed below.

<DESC>This modification to a previous "Pre-Solicitation" notice posted on July 13, 2004, hereby makes the following changes: 1.	This solicitation will be conducted as a 100% small business set-aside. 2.	However, the solicitation will provide for participation of the California State Licensing Agency (CSLA) pursuant to the Randolph Sheppard Act (RSA), 20 U.S.C. 107.  The RSA gives the blind priority in award of contracts to operate cafeterias on DoD property. The CSLA may submit an offer for Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare Center (FASWC), which is a Full Service facility.  After FISCSD consults with the Department of Education, the CSLA will receive award if its proposal is determined to be within the competitive range for the Lot/Line Item applicable to FASWC. Otherwise, award will be made to the eligible small business in accordance with the RFP evaluation terms. 3.	The Government has determined that Naval Station San Diego, Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, Naval Air Station North Island and Naval Submarine Base Point Loma are not covered under RSA. Award will be made to the eligible small business in accordance with the RFP evaluation terms. 4.	After FISCSD consults with the Department of Education, the CSLA will receive award if its proposal is determined to be within the competitive range for the Lot/Line Item applicable to FASWC.  5.	 The small business size standard is corrected to read $17.5M vice 15M.    6.	Based on the stated changes, the date anticipated for posting of the solicitation to the Navy’s Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) web site http://www.neco.navy.mil is revised to 07 Sep 2004.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled NON-LINEAR COMBUSTION INSTABILITY MODEL, NNM04063314R which was posted on June 25, 2004. You are notified that the following changes are made:  This procurement was previously synopsized as a sole source announcement.  After the review of the capability statements submitted in response to this synopsis, MSFC technical staff decided to reissue the synopsis as full and open competition. NASA/MSFC hereby issues a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the attached Statement of Work entitled, "Comprehensive Nonlinear Combustion Instability Model Development". The Statement of Work is attached as a Word document to this solicitation. Page limitation shall be 10 pages. The due date for responses is September 7, 2004. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. A firm-fixed price contract will be awarded to the technically acceptable, lowest priced proposal.  Your proposal must be in sufficient detail to allow adequate technical and cost/price evaluation.	 The Representations and Certifications is attached as a Word document and shall be submitted with the proposal. The following terms and conditions apply:  1852.204-76, 1852.215-84, 1852.223-72, 1852.225-70, 1852.227-72, 52.216-23, MSFC 52.211-93, MSFC 52.232-90, MSFC 52.246-90, MSFC 52.252-90, 52.213-4, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.232-1, 52.232-25, 52.232-33, 52.233-1, 52.239-1, 52.242-14, 52.242-15, 52.243-1, 52.246-2, 52.246-4, 52.246-9, 52.247-34, 52.249-1, 52.249-9, 1852.227-14, 1852.227-70, 52.227-14, 52.227-15 Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/MSFC Business Opportunities home page is  http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=62   Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). It is anticipated that reviewers of submitted proposals will have various areas of expertise, so the proposals should be written to be understood by engineers without a combustion stability background.  Specific terms in derived equations, specific submodels, and theories that address the requirements mentioned above should be clearly identified and fully explained, along with a description of which requirement it addresses, if not already obvious.  Given the page limit for these proposals, submittals should not contain long, detailed introductory or background sections that do not directly address model requirements; further, complete derivations should not be shown – only include derivation results and a short explanation.  Presenting results from similar CI models previously developed is encouraged in order to demonstrate current competency. The contractor shall not use computational fluid dynamics (CFD, that is, discretized forms of either the Euler equations or the Navier Stokes equations) as input to the model or as a solution technique to the model (i.e., proposals to develop time accurate CFD model will be considered non-responsive).

<CONTACT>Lisa Coleman, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-0612, Fax 301-480-5253, Email lcoleman@niaid.nih.gov
<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), helps to ensure an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, supporting the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the development of vaccines and other prevention strategies.  The purpose of this planned acquisition is to seek a contractor to continue an ongoing quality assessment program for virologic assays performed on samples from subjects enrolled in DAIDS-sponsored multi-site clinical studies.  The Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) Program is critical to the scientific integrity of on-going and future studies concerning HIV diagnosis, disease progression, assessment of treatment, vaccine efficacy and other preventive measures.  The VQA has been in operation since 1988 and has developed and standardized quality control procedures for approximately 25 virologic assays used in DAIDS-sponsored clinical trials.  DAIDS is seeking capability statements from organizations capable of performing the following tasks:  (1) implement standards of performance for existing and newly developed virologic assays and assess the ability of Sites to successfully perform the assays; (2) conduct studies on the adaptation, standardization and application of new and existing virologic and biostatistic methodologies; (3) acquire, characterize, store, document and disburse quality control materials and reagents to include biohazardous materials and infectious agents; (4) disseminate Virology Quality Assessment technical and scientific data; (5) maintain computerized software systems that support the VQA Program; and (6) expand services to include additional Sites when necessary through exercise of Options.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITIES RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS AN 8(a) SET-ASIDE; 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN. ALL SIZE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES. To ensure the validity and inter- and intra-laboratory comparability of virologic laboratory data obtained from DAIDS-supported clinical trials and HIV natural history studies, the contractor will continue a program for "Real-Time Assay Validation," where known quality control materials (QCMs) are tested by VQA-supported laboratories (Sites) in parallel with patient samples to ensure the validity of each assay “run.”  The contractor will also conduct a "Proficiency Testing" (PT) program, where unknown QCMs are tested by the Sites to periodically monitor Site assay performance.  The contractor will provide participating Sites with standardized reagents and controls for conducting research aimed at development and evaluation of virologic and statistical methodologies.  The VQA Program will serve current and future DAIDS-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups).  Currently supported User Groups include: the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG), the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), the Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), the Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA), the Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP), as well as other domestic and international individual grantees.  Collaborations are anticipated with CDC Global AIDS Program (GAP)-affiliated laboratories supporting the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) activities.  Currently, the VQA program serves approximately 55 domestic and 25 international Sites.  The base contract is expected to cover these 80 Sites.  Although the structure of the clinical trial networks is subject to change during the contract period, the changes are not expected to result in changes to the number of participating Sites in the base contract.  However, the Government anticipates a need to expand the number of Sites during the course of the contract, and such an increase in the contractor’s activities may be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as one or more Options in each of the contract years.  The work to be performed under this contract is currently being carried out by Rush Presbyterian – St. Luke’s Medical, under contract N01-AI-85354 and is expected to be completed on September 20, 2005.  All capability statements will be evaluated against related ability and experience for providing this type and magnitude of support; available qualified personnel; corporate experience and existing facilities and resources.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh healthcare System, University Drive, Pittsburgh PA 15240 intends to negotiate with Visualization Software LLC 76 Mourning Dove Drive, Stafford, VA 22554, on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 for software and licenses. The services required are that of an experienced computer programmer with evidence of knowledge, skills, and abilities in software development, the theorectical basis of item-response theory (IRT) coputer adaptive testing (CAT) and the associated mathematics required for the development of item scoring, selection, and stopping algorithms.  The purpose of this project is to develop a fully computerized, touch-screen activated, computer adaptive test (CAT) version of the Burden of Stroke Scale (BOSS), a patient-reported assessment of functioning and well-being in stroke survivors whose psychometric properties have been established (Doyle et al., 2004).  There are 2 primary phases to this project.  The first phase requires software development that will permit (a) entry, editing, and display of test items n both audio and graphic formats, (b) touch-screen activated response selections, (c) scoring routines, and (d) storage of all user responses and response parameters.  The second phase requires further software development that will permit real-time scoring, real-time computation of error estimates, item-selection routines, and stopping rules based on item-response-theory (IRT) itme parameter estimates.  Firms who wish to identify their interest and capability to provide an alternate system which will meet the capabilities and functionality described above may notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, no later than 9:00 AM on 9/06/04.  Such notification must include a complete description of proposed software, including narrative and capabilities described above.  Notification shall be mailed to Pamela Rayburg, Contracting Officer, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15206.  Upon receipt of any such notifications, the Contracting Officer will determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement or proceed with sole source negotiations.  This notice is not a request for competitve proposals.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for initial market research purposes only. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.     REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The U.S. Air Force' Electronic Systems Center is requesting price and availability information regarding relatively low-cost, off-the-shelf air surveillance and control systems. The target users for the requested system have minimal experience and ability to support advanced technology systems and therefore, the USAF is seeking candidate systems that use consumer grade operating system software and off-the-shelf consumer grade computer hardware. The primary system objective is to generate and display a real-time national air picture using source data that may include primary and secondary radar plot data, radar track data, flight plan data, and other airspace management information.  The secondary system objective is to provide automated capabilities that support guidance and control of aircraft.  The third objective is to interoperate (exchange data) with other installations or similar systems. Request firms having candidate systems provide the following information pertaining to the capabilities, price and availability of such candidate systems: Provide an overall system description, including intended use and air surveillance and air control functions. Provide system performance specifications and capacities to the extent possible. Describe operational software structure, language and standards with which it is compliant. Identify whether source code is made available to the procuring activity or end user. Identify system hardware and operating system software configuration. Identify system interface capabilities, including quantity and format type. Identify radar interface specifications, including quantity and format. Identify hardware and software maintenance concept. Identify any operational, training and system support features that would be advantageous to the target users. Identify where this system is or has been in use. Provide system cost data, include whether licensing is required, if so, whether site or national licenses are available. Provide expected lead time required for delivery, fielding and training.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a request for bid or proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for information provided in response to this synopsis.

Currently, a private company is managing and operating these services for the Visitor Services Office at Hoover Dam.  The current contract will expire on November 30, 2004.  After exhaustive research it has been determined to be in the best interest of the Government to convert these services from an acquisition type contract to a concession-type and it is anticipated that the process for competing that contract will take approximately 9 - 12 months.  This interim contract will continue to provide the following services for the Hoover Dam Visitor Services Office until the concession contract is awarded.  The contractor will be required to install and test its own computerized ticketing system, complete with six ticketing stations inside the tour center, one located at the kiosk at the garage for commercial accounts and sufficient computerized work stations to support off site reservations. Computerized work stations will also be required to support the sale of merchandise. The services to be performed would include:  (1)  Managing and operating on-site tour ticket  and merchandise sales at Hoover Dam seven days a week, from 9:00 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., excluding Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day (hours may be extended until 5:00 p.m., during the spring and summer months); (2)  Managing and operating an off-site telemarketing service that makes reserved (pre-sold) tour ticket sales available to commercial carriers, organizations and members of the general public, seven (7) days a week; (3)  Collecting and remitting fees for all Hoover Dam tour tickets sold for the Government; (4)  Providing designated Government personnel with on-line, real time access to tour ticket sales and reservation information for tour scheduling and operations; (5)  Providing commercial carrier drivers with pre-sold tickets in advance of their arrival, or no later than upon their arrival, at Hoover Dam; (6)  Delivering pre-sold tickets to other organizations and members of the general public in advance of their arrival, or no later than upon their arrival at a will-call location; (7)  Providing daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly tour ticket sales financial reports; (8)  Providing on-site informational brochures and fact sheets to visitors or directing them to the appropriate person or place where they can get the information needed; and (9) selling merchandise authorized for sale under the guidance of Public Law 106-46 including the photographing, processing and sale of souvenir photographs. This is not a request for proposals.  If your company is interested in performing the above work for the interim period of not more than 1 year, please submit the following information:  Company name, mailing address, contact name and telephone number, fax number, and a brief description of experience of performing services similar to those listed above.  As a part of our market research, we also request that you include information about your business size (number of employees and average annual revenue, socio-economic status).  Responses, submission of information, or requests for additional information are due by September 10, 2004, and should be directed to the Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region, Attention: LC-3114, P.O.

<DESC>This notice is issued by NASA/JSC to request information from interested parties regarding the JSC Occupational Medicine and Occupational Health Contract (OMOHC) recompetition that will be conducted during FY05.  Information received as a result of this notice will be used for planning purposes only.  In the interest of promoting competition, NASA/JSC would like to hear from interested parties regarding the feasibility of a new contracting approach that is under consideration.	   NASA/JSC is interested in motivating contractors to provide excellent performance during the life of a contract through a new incentive plan called Award Term.	This incentive is designed to foster long-term relationships by rewarding contractors with additional periods(s) of performance in compensation for achieving desired objectives at a high level of performance and reduced costs in lieu of a traditional award fee arrangement.  For this particular procurement, NASA/JSC is considering the possibility of allowing the contractor to earn up to a 10-year period of performance without further competition.  It is important to note that Award Terms are not the same as contract options.	Award Terms are earned based on contractor performance and cost savings; whereas, options are a unilateral right in a contract by which, for a specified time, the Government may elect to purchase additional supplies or services called for by the contract, or may elect to extend the term of the contract.   NASA/JSC is considering the use of a cost-plus-incentive fee structure to objectively evaluate cost, with an Award Term Incentive to reward excellent technical performance.  The Award Term Evaluation Process mirrors that of Award Fee; however, evaluations are to a greater extent based on objective metrics.  A cost gate, that includes cost incentives, must be met in order to earn additional term.   NASA has utilized this new contracting approach in several cases under a pilot program.  In an attempt to determine the feasibility of this approach for this particular procurement,  the Government is soliciting input from interested parties and asks that responses include answers to the following questions:  1.	Would the Award Term Incentive properly motivate contractor performance on the OMOHC and why? 2.	Would you submit a proposal if a solicitation is issued for the OMOHC with the Award Term Incentive and why? 3.	What changes, if any, would you suggest to this incentive plan and why? 4.	Have you had experience with Award Term Contracting?  If yes, please provide the name of the Government agency who awarded the contract, the contract number, a brief description of work, the contracting officer’s contact information, and your perception of how this incentivized / did not incentivize performance. Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments or questions to Jennifer L. Krause, Contract Specialist no later than COB Sept. 2, 2004.  When responding reference NNJ04064093LA, Occupational Medicine and Occupational Health Contract (OMOHC).	Comments may be forwarded via electronic transmission at omohseb@ems.jsc.nasa.gov or facsimile transmission at (281) 483-1139. This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.	Respondents will not be notified of the results. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunities home page is    http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	 It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

ODSI BACKGROUND: The ODSI system will be an end-to-end satellite system (spacecraft, payloads, ground system, launch integration, product dissemination, communication interfaces, and mission support) whose purpose is to enhance the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) sub-mission of the Space Control Mission Area.  A Milestone Decision Authority Program (MDAP), the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has recognized ODSI as a transformational program vital to the Department of Defense. The primary function of ODSI will be to provide imagery for space object characterization and orbital position data.  It is envisioned that the ODSI system will include a constellation of 3 or more satellites.  The imager will also provide object identification data on additional satellites as needed, including satellites in other deep space orbits.  The ODSI system will increase the Space Object Identification (SOI) coverage and capacity of the Space Surveillance Network and support satellite catalog maintenance and space order of battle for SSA.

<DESC>Market Survey: K/Ka/Q-BAND LOW PROFILE SATCOM ANTENNA SYSTEM FOR ON THE MOVE (OTM) OPERATION The US Army Communications Electronics Research, Development & Engineering Center (CERDEC) Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate is interested in receiving information regarding low profile, innovative multi-frequency antennas that could be appl ied to COTM for SATCOM systems.  It is envisioned that a new generation of agile wide frequency band antennas will be required to make communications on the move, over rough terrain, at high rate a reality for the Army Future Force. Specifically, communications on the move at high data rate will be supported over the transformational communications satellite, the advanced EHF satellite, wideband-gap-filler satellite and commercial KA band and KU band constellations.  The government re alizes that a single antenna aperture may not satisfy all the bands of interest; however we are soliciting industrys perspectives on how these diverse constellations can be supported by a minimal number of diverse apertures.  Future vehicles that would ho st communications on the move will be constrained in size weight and power and will have to wrestle with mutual co-site interference issues. The objective antenna is targeted for installation on a variety of vehicles including, but not limited to, a S832/A Standard Integrated Command Post System (SICPS) Rigid Wall Shelter (RWS) that will be transported and operated from an ECV-M113 vehicle, a B radley Fighting Vehicle, a STRYKER vehicle and various FCS vehicles.  Size, weight and power consumption (SWAP) are of paramount importance, particularly for the Bradley, STRYKER, and FCS vehicles (less then 18 inch footprint).  Conflicts, if any, between antenna SWAP and throughput requirements should be identified.  The off-road vehicle dynamic condition objectives are described in Table I and objective environmental conditions in Table II.  These are representative conditions and not firm requirements. It is desired that the physical profile be kept as small as possible for covertness and transportability. The system shall include an antenna that is steered electronically, mechanically, or via some hybrid solution set, along with the associated positioner/controller technology, sensor packages, radome, LNA and HPA.  Transmit and receive shall be accomplished  with a single aperture.  The system should provide for full azimuth coverage and elevation coverage from zenith to at least the horizon without any keyhole effect.  The antenna should acquire and remained locked on the Wideband Gapfiller Satellite (WGS) o r other satellite while providing a continuously usable signal when the vehicle is on the pause and move.  Should the antenna drop lock, it should automatically reacquire the signal with no operator intervention.  The objective antenna will operate over th e Ka uplink range of 30-31GHz, Q band uplink range of 43.5-45.5 GHz and K band downlink range of 20.2-21.2 GHz.  The antenna will transmit in the right-hand circular polarization mode at Q band, right or left hand circular polarization at Ka band and recei ve in the left-or right hand circular polarization mode.  The following combinations of transmitting and receiving polarization will be accomplished, but not simultaneously:  Transmit RH and Receive LH; Transmit LH and Receive RH for K/Ka Band operation on ly.  Q/K-band operation utilizes RHCP Transmit and RHCP Receive operation only.  We are interested in what data rates the various antenna solutions would support for both on the move (OTM) and on the pause operation. In addition to satellite and UAV communications, line of sight terrestrial communications also needs to be supported.  The Government envisions a separate antenna would support this purpose, however industry's perspective is solicited.  This would require tracking at the horizon or lower. Nominal RF values by Application Type are given in table IV.  Estimated Throughp ut capabilities required are given in Table V.  These are estimates only.  The contractor is required to provide link budget information ref Table III), including all conditions and assumptions, to support their chosen antenna size and throughput. Interested parties should submit white papers that shall include, but are not limited to the following information:  link budget, performance data (to include size, weight and power consumption estimates), configuration drawings or illustrations, mounting concept, discussion of design maturity and remaining development, technical and schedule risk assessment, estimated development and unit costs (@100 ea quantities). For link budgets submissions, calculations should use the below Government Propagation mode l. White papers must be received no later than 4:00 PM, 30 September 2004, at HQ USA CERDEC, Attn: AMSRD-CER-ST-SS-TA (Louis Coryell), Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey 07703-5203.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Biological Incubators
<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, intends to enter into a single source contract with Percival, Perry, Iowa.  This contract is to procure three Percival Scientific Biological Incubators, Model I-66LL, which will be used with and back-up for three Government-owned Percival I-36LL Biological Incubators and two Government-owned Percival I-66LL Biological Incubators  at the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation (NCGRP).  These incubators are used for long-term storage of plant tissue culture materials as well as experimentation to develop techniques for the long-term preservation of plant material.  The long-termed storage of the tissue culture material is part of the germplasm collection and extremely valuable.  Consistency and reliability of the incubators is key to preventing loss of plant material due to incubator failure.  Consistency is needed between the units to allow the movement of plant material from one chamber to another with a minimum of  variation in the environment.  This is most critical with experimental material as all experiments are geared toward long-term storage and often run 12 months or more.  A single disruption in temperature after 10 months can jeopardize more than an entire years worth of work as it often takes months to bulk-up plant material to initiate an experiment.  The NCGRP serves as a germplasm repository for the entire nation, maintaining over 1500 accessions in tissue culture including Plant Varietal Protection voucher samples, which the NCGRP is entrusted with.  These incubators have capability for connection to a remote alarm and a control system that is compatible with the NCGRP remote monitoring and alarm system.  *Please FAX a Qualification Statement by Close of Business September 9, 2004, to the attention of Lee Shea at 970/492-7031 if interested in this procurement.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Intent to Award Sole Source - Coherent High-Rep Laser System
<DESC>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy intends to award a purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to Coherent Laser, Inc. for an 18 Watt CW SLM pump laser, model Verdi V18, regenerative laser amplifier Ti: Sapphire, and second harmonic generator for REGA output.  This item service is being acquired for academic and research applications at the US Air Force Academy Physics Laboratory.  The required laser system must deliver output at 852nm and 426 nm at repetition rate > 250 kHz and with typical pulses of width under 1pSec at 852nm.  The laser must deliver non-mode-hop, single longitudinal-mode output; i.e., line width must be under 5MHz.  Systems based on multi-axial design (MAD or QMAD) are not acceptable because of the mode-beating noise inherent in this design.  The laser must have a noise performance of lower than 0.03% rms from 10Hz to 1GHz.  When replacing pump laser diode modules the laser head position and beam propagation path must not change, nor shall the laser cavity require any realignment or exposure to the laboratory environment.  The pump diode module and the delivery fiber must detach from each other.  The delivery fiber must be single core and not detach at the laser head when replacing the laser pump diode module.  The laser system must automatically and continuously optimize the pump diode wavelength in order to maximize optical conversion efficiency and to ensure maximum pump diode lifetime. Systems that use an assumed pre-programmed decay rate are unacceptable.  The laser system must be compatible with, and will be seeded with the Academy's existing Verdi-V10 and MIRA 900 Laser system.  Coherent has been found to be the only vendor who manufactures a complete laser system that meets the Academy's experiment requirements and is also equipped with a service and repair group capable of making all repairs on-site and in a timely manner.  Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.  No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  If no response is received by 3 Sep 2004  04:00PM, MDT, to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies and or services though a sole source procurement with Coherent Laser, Inc., a sole source award will be made

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS
<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, MD intends to negotiate a follow-on SOLE SOURCE procurement with Henry Ford Heath Systems.  The contractor will provide services, materials, facilities, and equip ment to continue implementation of a Cardiovascular Disease Automated Clinical Practice Guideline (ACPG), as well as perform data collection and analysis for the Preventative Services Clinical Practice Guideline.   Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) is a memb er of a public/private partnership with Tripler Army Medical Center facilitated by the Pacific Regional Program Office (now the Hui) to automate cardiovascular clinical practice guidelines that was established as a result of a FY99 appropriation for the De fense Health Program.  Due to prior participation in this program, established agreements, and to ensure the compatibility and consistency of approach and the maintenance of present success and failure comparisons of the ACPG project, the current contracto r is the only acceptable source to continue to serve as a partner with the Government for this requirement.  The existing partnership has resulted in a working relationship with established agreements that would have to be redeveloped, incurring unnecessar y loss of time and expense to the Government.   Competitive bidding would result in significant, project delays, would require duplication of cost to the government, and would not result in cost savings.  This is a SOLE SOURCE procurement under the authori ty of FAR 6.302-1 and is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, statements of capability to fulfill this requirement received from other responsible businesses prior to close of business on 03 September 2004 will be evaluated.  Offerors responding  to this notice must provide a statement of capability to the Contract Specialist.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide analytical, technical, functional, administrative and management support to the GIG Operations Continuity Planning Office (GO52).  2. BACKGROUND: DISA requires technical support from analysts that specialize in continuity of operations (COOP) planning and development.  They are required to support the development, production and implementation of a DISA-wide COOP plan, standard operating procedures, training and exercise support.  These products provide assurance that DISA can execute, when necessary, varying levels of COOP capabilities during exercises, scheduled events and “all-threats” situations. This effort is in direct support of Presidential Directive 67 (PDD 67), “Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Operations”.  This PDD directs DoD Components to have a plan in place to ensure continuous operations in the event of a national emergency.  The requested contractor support is essential to meet the expectations of the PDD.  GO52 lacks the staff resources with the requisite technical capacity to develop, maintain, train, and exercise a DISA-wide COOP plan.  3.

The Government will evaluate quotes and make a Best Value selection in accordanc e with listed criteria.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.  Factor 1:  Technical Capability/Understanding of the Requirements:  Both the offerors understanding of the specifi c requirements and the overall scope of work required and the offerors demonstrated technical capability.  This determination includes an analysis of the propo sed level of effort.  Factor 2:  Personnel Qualifications:  The experience and capabilities of the personnel that will be assigned the effort.  Factor 3:  Past Performance:  Offerors performance on three past federal and/or commercial contracts within the  last three years, plus additional recent relevant information provided by the offerors for consideration.  Factor 4:  Price:  Not adjectivally rated, but considered for reasonableness in the best value determination.  Each proposal will be rated based on evaluation of each factor using the following Adjectival Rating and Standards Scale:  OUTSTANDING  Very comprehensive, in-depth, clear response.  Proposal consistently meets this standard with no omissions.  Consistently high quality performance can be ex pected.  EXCELLENT  Extensive, detailed response to all requirements similar to outstanding in quality, but with minor areas of unevenness or spottiness.  High quality performance is likely but not assured due to minor omissions or areas where less than e xcellent performance might be expected.  GOOD -  No deficiencies in the response.  Better than acceptable performance can be expected, but in some significant areas, there is an unevenness or spottiness that might impact performance.  FAIR  The response g enerally meets requirements but there is not expectation of better than acceptable performance.  Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor impact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without major revisions to the proposal.  POOR  Th e response fails to meet one or more requirements.  Deficiencies exist in significant areas but can be corrected during negotiations without major revisions to the proposal or serious deficiencies exist in areas with minor impact.  UNACCEPTABLE  Serious d eficiencies exist in significant areas.  The proposal cannot be expected to meet the stated requirements without major revisions.  The proposal only indicates a willingness to perform in accordance with the requirements document without specifying how or d emonstrating the capability to do so.  Only vague indications of the required capability are present.  Your firms submission should reflect and demonstrate an understanding of the Statement of Work and provide sufficient detail to be properly considered.  Resumes and qualifications of proposed personnel shall also be provided.  Your submission should reflect the quality and experience of proposed personnel at competitive fixed prices.  The technical proposal shall not exceed 25 pages in length and single s ided.  The technical proposal shall include labor mix and hours, but not labor rates.  During the technical evaluation, the labor mix and hours, not labor rates, will be evaluated.  Price submissions shall be under separate cover and competitive firm fixed  priced.  Resumes and past performance do not count towards the page limitation.  Email is the preferred method of submission.  Proposal due date is 13 SEPTEMBER 2004, 1:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time (EST).

52.211-17     DELIVERY OF EXCESS QUANTITIES (SEP 1989)

The Contractor is responsible for the delivery of each item quantity within allowable variations, if any.  If the Contractor delivers and the Government receives quantities of any item in excess of the quantity called for (after considering any allowable variation in quantity), such excess quantities will be treated as being delivered for the convenience of the Contractor.  The Government may retain such excess quantities up to $250 in value without compensating the Contractor therefor, and the Contractor waives all right, title, or interests therein.  Quantities in excess of $250 will, at the option of the Government, either be returned at the Contractor's expense or retained and paid for by the Government at the contract unit price.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ); quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the design and manufacture of dichroic beamsplitter(s) according to the specifications outlined below.  The chosen vendor(s) shall design and manufacture dichroic beamsplitters according to the specifications outlined below. As part of this procurement, the vendor(s) shall also provide in-house “baseline” performance testing (including cryogenic) to demonstrate that the beamsplitters were made to the outlined specifications. More detailed tests will be performed at NASA Ames. Where applicable, the cost quoted for the beamsplitters should include representative test coupons also to be delivered to NASA Ames as part of the procurement.  The vendor shall also provide a delivery schedule for the beamsplitter products, and inform NASA Ames of any modifications to the original procurement schedule. The purchase will be costed as a firm-fixed-price contract.  As part of their bid, the vendor will provide a breakdown of  (1)	a basic cost quote for Beamsplitter #1 and Beamsplitter #2, quantity 1-each, (2)	a delta cost for one additional quantity of each beamsplitter, and  (3)	detailed costs for any supporting design study, tooling activity, etc. The cost profile should be made clear as to separate the cost of the design & manufacture of Beamsplitter #1 and its supporting design, materials, tooling, testing, test coupons, etc. costs from the cost of the design & manufacture of Beamsplitter #2 and its supporting design, materials, tooling, testing, test coupons, etc.  This statement of work also supports splitting of line items, where a vendor may place a bid for one beamsplitter, as long as the supporting information as outlined in the SOW is addressed for that beamsplitter item. This does not affect the ranking of a proposed bid since each beamsplitter type will be compared separately (cost and performance) after receipt of all quotes. The vendor(s) shall provide any detailed explanations of exceptions/ clarifications if the proposed deliverable(s) cannot meet the specifications. The vendor(s) shall also provide a detailed list of in-house tests to be performed and how these tests will verify performance required.  Depending on the cost and performance estimates for the beamsplitter and/or beamsplitters received, NASA Ames will procure one or two beamsplitters from the chosen vendor(s). The beamsplitter(s) with supporting test coupons are to be delivered to NASA Ames on/before January 15, 2005. Specifications The two AstroBiology Explorer (ABE) beamsplitters are both in collimated space and are part of an infrared cryogenic (T &lt; 20 K) spectrometer. They must separate light into 2.5-5 micron, 5-10 micron, and 10-20 micron) spectral ranges. Although the order of the beamsplitters to split the light is not a static design parameter, the following specifications have been made for the current ABE optical design, shown schematically in a figure available upon request. The end result is to separate 2.5-5 micron, 5-10 micron, and 10-20 micron light with high throughput and no dropouts/gaps between restricted wavelength regions (see specifications). ABE Beamsplitter #1 This beamsplitter is in collimated space. The specifications below are for a T=20K cryogenic environment.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) set forth in FAR Part 13.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for an ultraviolet diode pumped solid state laser Background: The NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is developing quantum sensing and communications technologies that require an ultraviolet (UV) diode pumped solid state (DPSS) laser.  The UV DPSS laser will be used to pump a non-linear crystal to generate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) photons.  The preferably continuous wave (CW) laser (although a Q-switched (QS) kilohertz repetition rate laser is also acceptable) operating in a third-harmonic output mode with laser emission near 350 nm (either 351 nm or 355 nm) will excite a non-linear crystal such as beta-barium-borate (BBO) to produce two daughter photons whose sum frequency is equal to the frequency of the pump photon.  The daughter photons produced by the SPDC process have unique properties that permit them to be used to advantage in the area of quantum sensing and/or communications. Specifications: The diode pump solid-state laser shall meet the following specifications: 1.  Type of laser: The Diode-pumped solid-state laser shall be either a Nd:YAG, or Nd:YVO4, or Nd:YLF laser medium, with third harmonic generation. 2.

<DESC>This notice is part of a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes Step 1 of a 2-Step Sealed Bid solicitation; information to determine the offerors technical capability to meet the requirements is requested in this notice.  A written solicitation will be issued at a later date, only to those offerors deemed technically capable in Step 1.  The written solicitation will constitute Step 2 and require offerors to submit firm prices in the form of a Sealed Bid. This notice is being issued as an Invitation for Bids (IFB) for Liquid Oxygen (IAW MIL-PRF-25508F) and Liquid Nitrogen (IAW MIL-PRP-27401D) products.  Production and delivery of products by over-the-road, bulk cryogenic tanker trucks is required.  The approximate size of deliveries is 25 tons per tanker truck.  Multiple truck loads per day may be required.  Delivery of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen to Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Huntsville, AL and delivery to US Army, Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, AL, FOB destination is required.  The Best Estimated Quantities (BEQ) for bulk liquid oxygen per year is 5,000 tons (LOx - 4 tankers/day max) and liquid nitrogen per year is 32,500 (LN2 - 10 tankers/day max). The period of performance will be 1 January 2005 through 31 December 2007 as the base period with two one-year option periods.   A fixed price requirements type contract is planned for each product, however, one contractor could supply both products under a single contract.	However, an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract for the delivery of liquid nitrogen may be issued as a dual source split requirement arrangement only if a business case warrants this arrangement to be in the best interest of the government.  Under either arrangement, the Kennedy Space Center will award and administer the prime contract(s), while personnel at MSFC will issue funded delivery orders and receive shipments in accordance with the contract.  Request for Shipment will be placed with a minimum of 48 hours notice prior to the required delivery time. Prospective offerors are required to provide the following information to determine technical capability for Step 1.  Technical proposals shall not include prices or pricing information. 1.  Discuss your production, storage and distribution facilities that will be used to produce and deliver liquid oxygen and/or liquid nitrogen requirements.	Provide a table listing for each plant location (primary and backup) the types and amounts of products produced per day (in tons for each product), storage capacity (in tons for each product), transportation fleet (no. of tanker-trucks, average age, capacities, driver staff and capacity), one-way distance and transit time from plant to delivery point. 2.  Discuss your quality management systems and safety program, including your top level mission statement and/or goals.  Complete quality/safety directives/operating procedures are not required, but may be referenced.  Discuss the level of corporate commitment to quality and safety. 3.  Past Performance – discuss any contracts you have performed in the last 3 years to provide these MIL-SPEC products to the government and/or commercial customers.	For each contract, provide the type of product delivered, quantity per year and length of service to that customer.  Provide current addresses and phone numbers for up to three customers that can be contacted for verification of successful past performance. In the second step, only bids based upon technical proposals determined to be acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information.  Each bid in the second step must be based on the offeror’s own technical proposal.   The Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the proposal as submitted.  The Government may proceed with the second step without requesting further information from any offeror; however, the Government may request additional information from offerors of proposals that it considers reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable, and may discuss proposals with the offerors. A notice of unacceptability will be forwarded to any offeror upon completion of the Step 1 proposal evaluation and final determination of unacceptability. Only one technical proposal may be submitted by each offeror for each product.	The offeror may submit one proposal to include both products if desired.   The provisions and clauses in the IFB are those in effect through FAC 01-24. The NAICS code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 325120 and 1000 employees respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All qualified responsible business sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9. Step 1 technical proposals for the items described above are due by 4:00 p.m. local time on September 27, 2004, and must include all the information requested above to determine technical capability.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is RFQ IBM04Q0031 and is being issued as a Request for Quote.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business concerns (applicable Commerce Business Daily Numbered Note: 1).  The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 333995 with a small business standard of 500 employees or less.  The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico (USIBWC), has a requirement for a firm-fixed price commercial item contract for three automatic lubrication systems to be installed on three water turbine generators located at the Falcon Dam Generating Station:   Falcon Heights, Texas.  The lubrication system specified shall be a single line parallel lubrication system.  Each turbine has a total of 20 wicket gates covering a total of 163 lubrication points.  Each system shall include an air-operated grease pump station, controlled by a 115 VAC electrical controller.  Each controller must have the capacity to operate and monitor two independent zones per turbine.  Accessory components, air solenoid valves, individual, individual lubricant injectors, header and feed line piping and hose, and interconnecting hardware shall also be included.  The controller must provide visual diagnostic feedback to verify completion of a lubrication event.  Systems relying on series progressive or dual line operation will not be considered.  The lubrication system shall be suitable for heavy bodied grease, NLG1 #1 or #2.  Written verification from the system supplier that the grease has been function tested will be required.  System Operation - All three lubrication systems shall be operational within 45 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. Each turbine lubrication system will consist of one pump serving two lubrication zones per turbine.  Both zones shall be controlled and monitored by a single controller.  Forty-four (44) lubrication points will be lubricated on a daily (24-hour) interval.  One hundred nineteen (119) points will be lubricated on a monthly (30-day) interval.  The lubrication system will be expected to run intermittently.  The system controller will control and initiate both at daily and monthly lube events.  The air-operated grease pump will supply grease under pressure to the network of injectors.  The injectors shall displace a measured amount of lubricant to the respective lubrication point through a feed line.  During a “daily” lubrication event, a normally open valve located on the “monthly” supply line leg will close, isolating the monthly circuit or zone.  Conversely, during a “monthly” lubrication event, a N/O valve will close isolating the daily circuit or zone.  After a successful lubrication event on each zone has occurred, the controller will return the valves to the N/O state.   Once system pressure has been achieved (between 2,500-600 psi), the pressure switch located in each zone will signal the controller, terminating the pump operation.  The vent valve located at the pump will open allowing the line pressure to vent.  A small amount of lubricant will return to the drum.  This venting will allow the injectors to reload once the line pressure reaches 1,000 psi.  If during a lube event the system controller does not receive a signal from the pressure transducer or pressure switch, an alarm contact on the controller will open signaling a lubrication fault.  The minimum recharge pressure specification for the injectors will be 1,000 psi with no exceptions.  The equipment and components described herein are typical for the specified system.  Equipment proposals shall include, but not limited to the following materials:  Air-Operated Grease Pump Stations –1) Air-operated pump stations shall be provided and located as shown in the plans.

BACKGROUND:  Because Military Pay Operations is committed to educating the customer on their pay, DFAS is seeking to use email marketing to keep customers up to date on pay specific issues.  DFAS is in search of an electronic mail service vendor who provides web-based software that will enable DFAS to send permission-based emails to DFAS's subscribers.  The email marketing tool should enable DFAS to accomplish the following 3 main objectives:  (1) educate the customer through the use of email bulletins and periodic newsletters, (2) track and measure the customer's use of the email newsletters and bulletins, (3) follow up on customer responses both in automated and manual form. This online account, hosted by the vendor, will store DFAS specific information such as newsletter articles, pictures, surveys, email address lists, and tracking results. 
SCOPE: The vendor will be required to maintain DFAS's account on their server, and provide access to authorized users to support the creation, delivery and tracking of email marketing efforts.  Within the first year of acquiring the vendor's services, DFAS will target solely Army customers for the receipt of email newsletters and bulletins. We project to reach roughly 286,000 subscriber.  During the second year of the initiative, we will expect to have 523,000 subscribers.  In the third year, we expect to reach roughly 822,000 subscribers.  DFAS plans to send out batch emails to all subscribers approximately 6 times per year.  For example, in the first year, DFAS will send approximately 286,000 emails 6 times per year totaling 1,716,000 emails sent in that year.
OBJECTIVES:  DFAS is seeking a vendor who can provide a web-based software that will enable DFAS to send permission-based emails, as well as store all data relating to email marketing efforts on the vendor's server.

<DESC>These are answers to questions that have been asked in regards to the subject combined synopsis/solicitation.

Question:

I am unsure in what format the proposal should be submitted. I have been trying to locate the document “Federal Acquisition Circular 04-24, dated 19 July 2004” as mentioned in the Solicitation but have so far been unable to track it down. Does this document stipulate the solicitation format or can I use my own format so long as it covers all the details listed in the solicitation?

Answer:

Correction, “Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24, dated 19 July 2004”.  One possible source to locate this information is at www.arnet.gov.  

Question:

We would like to make our submission electronically.  What is the preferred way to indicate our compliance with all the FARs cited in the solicitation?  Do we just state that we comply or do you want us to sign and scan the forms?

Answer:

You may make your submission electronically, to jpeterson@comdt.uscg.mil and ndouglas@comdt.uscg.mil.  Submit to both addresses.  Please be advised that large files should be broken into manageable sizes to ensure proper receipt and transmission.  Upon receipt, opening and successful printing of your proposal, an email will be sent to you confirming the number of pages received.  The Contracting Officer will check her email promptly at 1pm on 31 August 2004 to ensure all emails have been received and printed by the established deadline.  

You must sign and scan the appropriate forms to indicate compliance with all FAR requirements cited in the solicitation. 
 
Question:

One of the criteria stated for evaluation is past performance.  Is there anything specific you would like us to supply for this?

Answer:

Provide at least three, relevant references for past performance.  Provide the Name and address of the organization; a Point of Contact name and contact information (phone and/or email); applicable contract number; dates of work effort performed; and a brief description of the work effort performed.  
 
Question:

Also, you ask for a completed copy of 52.213-3 which I show is:
 
52.213-3 Notice to Supplier. 
As prescribed in 13.302-5(c), insert the following clause: 
This is a firm order ONLY if your price does not exceed the maximum line item or total price in the Schedule. Submit invoices to the Contracting Officer. If you cannot perform in exact accordance with this order, Withhold Performance, and notify the Contracting Officer immediately, giving your quotation. 
If this is the correct clause, there is nothing to complete.

Answer:

Correction, “Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offer Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items.”

Question:

How does this solicitation relate to RFI/Solicitation Number HSCG23-04-R-RFIROV? The specifications seem similar, but not identical. Does either solicitation supercede the other? Or should these be considered jointly? 

Answer:
An RFI was issued to gather information.  This solicitation was issued to request offers based on the requirements stated in solicitation number HSCG23-04-F-DDX166.  

Question:
Would you consider multiple price proposals or a "price list" with different options that are referenced but not specified, such as the tracking system? 

Answer:
Your offer(s) in response to the solicitation should be priced for a specific solution.
Question:
It seems that 52.213-3 should be 52.212-3 , and 52.215-5 should be 52.212-5 
Answer:
Correct.  “52.213-3” should read “52.212-3”.  Additionally, “52.212-5” should read “52.212-5”.


The deadline remains no later than 3pm, 31 August 2004

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to technical questions submitted against RFP Number N00173-04-R-RS07, and incorporate a revised requirement for the LWIR Imager Unit in SOW Section 7.
1.  Responses are hereby provided to the following Technical and business questions:

Question 1: In Section 8.1.4(7), cabling and software are requested for archiving, video processing and editing.  Can you provide information on the platform (PC Hardware) and system (Windows? Version?) that the software should be compatible with, and the interface (connector/protocol) for the cable?  Answer 1: The platform will be either Windows based desktop or lap-top running Windows XP and it will have at least 512 megs of RAM. The cable interface may include some or all of the following: USB, serial, Firewire, PCMCIA card reader. The data stored shall be compatible with Adobe Premier, Photoshop, Windows Media player.

Question 2: Should the "Durable locking case" for the Integrated Monitoring and Control Station (8.1.3,1) be waterproof?  Do you have a protection level (ie. NEMA-4) that you would require for the waterproof cases that are specified for the sensor units (Sections 4.0 through 7.0)?  Should there be cases for tripods and pan/tilt units?  Answer 2: The cases, including the control station, shall protect the equipment from rain if exposed while in the field. They are not expected to provide protection if accidentally submerged. The pan and tilts shall also be supplied with cases that provide the same level of protection. The tripods shall be supplied with soft-bodied carrying cases to facilitate transport to and from the field.

Question 3: Do you have a distance in mind for the cabling (Video and Pan/Tilt control) from the imaging units to the IM&CS, if so, how far? Answer 3: A distance of  approximately 25 feet between the imaging units and IM&CS.

Question 4: For the Pan/Tilt Controller (Section 8.1.2), Recording Units (Section 8.1.4) and LCD Video Display (LCDVD, Section 9.0), would the use of an inverter to provide power to the units from a 12V DC source be acceptable? Various DC voltages are mentioned (12V-32V in Section 6.1.10, 6-15V in Section 8.1.4), would a configuration where a single source of 12VDC (10 to 15VDC) can be connected to the system and power all devices be acceptable? Answer 4: Proposed solutions to Government requirements are the responsibility of the Offeror. The Government anticipates that the required systems will be powered primarily using an AC power source..

Question 5: How important is the requirement for the LCD Video Display (LCDVD, Section 9.0) to accept a 960i video signal?  This format is not often listed in specifications, however all of the other formats, including 1080i are.  Answer 5: Proposed solutions to Government requirements are the responsibility of the Offeror.

Question 6: How important is the requirement for the camera for the Night Vision Unit (Section 5.1.2, 8) to have a Focal Distance of 4.2 to 42mm?  Would a device with a wider range of focal distances, which includes the 4.2 to 42mm range, be acceptable? Answer 6: SOW Section 5.1.2(8) is hereby revised to read:  Focal Distance of at least 4.2 – 42mm.

Question 7: Do you have a preferred size, or minimum size, for the 4 integrated monitors in the IM&CS (Section 8.1.3, 2)?  Answer 7: A minimum diagonal distance of 10" is requested for the integrated screens.

Question 8: Relative to the Pan/Tilt Unit (Section 8.1.2): Is an outdoor/weatherproof Pan/Tilt Unit required? Answer 8: The required Pan/Tilt Unit will be used in Indoor/Outdoor environments, but will not be exposed to rain.

Question 9: Relative to the Pan/Tilt Unit (Section 8.1.2): Will the Pan/Tilt be used to track a moving object?  If so, is there a typical (or min./max.) distance that you expect between the object and the imagers?  Is there a typical speed and distance the object would cover?  Answer 9: The required system will not be used for tracking.

Question 10: Relative to the Pan/Tilt Unit (Section 8.1.2): Would it benefit your application to have a variable speed Pan/Tilt, rather than a fixed speed?  Answer 10: Proposed solutions to Government requirements are the responsibility of the Offeror.

Question 11: Relative to the Pan/Tilt Unit (Section 8.1.2): Do you have a Pan/Tilt speed (Degrees per second) and/or a resolution/accuracy requirement? Answer 11: No

Question 12: Is there an expected date for award of the contract? Answer 12: The Government anticipates award not later than 30 SEP 2004.

Question 13: Is there an incumbent?  Has a contractor been performing this or similar work for you? Answer 13: No

Question 14: Are their specific devices (Manufacturer and model) that you are using now, or are familiar with, that you would either want to have included to fulfill the requirements, or not want since they have not met your needs? Answer 14: Proposed solutions to Government requirements are the responsibility of the Offeror.

Question 15: Would you please provide us with the device names/manufacturers and nomenclature from which the specifications in the SOW were developed? Answer 15: See Answer 14.

Question 16: We hereby request an extension to the deadline for proposal submission.  Answer 16: Pursuant to revisions incorporated in this amendment, the deadline for proposal submission is hereby revised to 10 SEP 2004.

Question 17: Please confirm the proposal delivery address.  Answer 17: See the Contracting Office Address posted above.

Question 18: SOW paragraph 1.2 refers to NRL/STO -- would you please define STO and give us some idea of their function, organization, location, etc? Answer 18: NRL/STO refers to: Naval Research Laboratory/Signature technology Office.

<DESC>Technical Questions regarding the "Research Scientific Personnel
Support for the Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) Project" RFQ (solicitation
#PMB4038).


As a result of questions asked from an offeror, this requirement is amended to provide the following clarifications:  


1.    The RFQ indicates that primary work site would be USUHS and secondary work site is Deployment Health Support Directorate, ASD(FH).  Is it sufficient if the Project Coordinator and the Senior Epidemiologist are in Bethesda for access and response to USUHS and other staff members are at USUHS only as necessary (determined by the PD)?  


No, it is not sufficient, on site is required, with additional staff at USU as needed. 

 
     a.    Could the other three positions be located outside of Bethesda? 


No, must be located at USU.


     b.    If the data is electronic, is the physical presence of staff at USUHS immaterial? 


Data is electronic, but there are too many issues that will require close contact with USU Principal Investigators (PIs).  Efficient staffing for complex data management requires on-site at USU.


2.    Does the Data Abstractor have to physically go to military installations to get the data?  Hence, should we cost travel to some installations and if so which ones?


No. I do not think travel will be necessary.  You aren’t required to travel to any installations.  


3.    The RFQ sounds as if it is describing individuals, e.g. one data abstractor.  Could there be two or more data abstractors if that is necessary to efficiently gather the data so long as the total number of hours allocated to those two individuals does not exceed 960?  


Yes, you the contractor has to assure the staff you are providing can accomplish the work as outlined in the synopsis. 


4.    What is expected in the option years? 

The option years will involve additional data management and analyses.
