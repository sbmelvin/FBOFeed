<DESC>Market Survey/Request for Sources InformationCustomer Satisfaction Survey

General Information:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (Center) provides a wide variety of products and services to a diverse customer base through multiple business units, to be referred to as organizations.  These organizations include the Enterprise Services Center (ESC), the Logistics Center (AML), the Academy (AMA), Acquisition Services (AMQ) and Facility Management (AMP).  The diverse customer base includes the FAA, the Department of Transportation (DOT) and other DOT modes, other federal agencies, and various private and international groups.  
The Center management team has identified a requirement to assess multiple aspects of customer satisfaction with all products and services.  Numerous customer satisfaction surveys are currently in use dealing with specific customer groups by individual organizations, branches and/or divisions of organizations.  The requirement is to provide an enterprise assessment of customer satisfaction, and would not replace current surveys, but rather would include additional data points to capture that enterprise assessment.
The Center management team requires support of expert professional services to evaluate survey options and recommend a specific survey solution to the Center management team.  Additionally, professional services are required to design and develop the survey and to design and develop detailed reports on the analysis of the resulting data set.  To achieve these objectives, the contractor will need to analyze the different organizations to understand the products, services, customer base and specific survey requirements of each.  Additionally, the contractor will need to develop an understanding of the surveys currently in use and the data being gathered by each.  Further, the contractor will need to develop sufficient data processing, statistics and report design in order to adequately analyze and report on the resulting data.
Preliminary data has been gathered on the current surveys, presenting a summary level view of the scope of each.  Additional information may be required to provide a complete understanding of the current survey environment.  The Center will provide appropriate points of contact from each organization that will be responsible for providing any additional information required by the contractor.  The Center has an existing web-based survey tool that will be used to administer the new survey.

<a href="mailto:Janice.P.Stewart@nasa.gov">Janice M. Stewart</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement to extend the current contract NAS8-03060 for missionoperations and data analysis for the Chandra X-Ray Observatory (CXO).  The extension willprovide the Chandra X-Ray Center (CXC) functions comprised of the CXO Operations ControlCenter and the Science Center.	The functions include science system engineering, groundsystem development and maintenance, mission operations,science and operations planning,science research, science dissemination, general observation program and outreach supportfor the CXO Program.  The contractual action that will result from this action will be amodification extending the current contract NAS8-03060 with the Smithsonian AstrophysicalObservatory (SAO) in Cambridge MA.  The CXO was launched on July 23, 1999, for a five-year mission.  This mission durationwas subsequently approved as a ten-year mission in 2000.  This resulted in a sole sourcecontract award to SAO for mission/science operations and data analysis for the periodSeptember 1, 2003 to July 31, 2010.  The contract currently provides mission/scienceoperations through July 31, 2009 plus one year of data analysis after spacecraftoperations end.  Given the performance of observatory systems over the course of theprogram and lifetime studies performed, it is expected that the CXO will continue to meetor exceed program requirements through FY2018 (for a total mission life of nineteen yearsand two months).  Therefore this contractual action would extend the CXO contract throughSeptember 30, 2018 for mission/science operations, with one additional year to completedata analysis.	NASA/MSFC intends to modify the current contract, NAS8-03060 with SAO.	The objective ofthe CXO is to address some of the most fundamental and pressing questions in present-dayastrophysics through observations of matter at the extremes of temperature, density, andenergy content.  The CXO is the third of NASAs four Great Observatories.  Thiscontract extension will provide continuation of the CXC functions comprised of theOperations Control Center and the Science Center.  This includes maintaining all of thesystems, software, products, procedures, and tools necessary for operating and executingthe science program of a world-class observatory,  maintaining the health and safety ofthe observatory through a dedicated group of engineers and scientists that have adetailed knowledge of all the observatory systems and subsystems, and the scientificexpertise to define and execute the scientific observation program and analyze theresulting data products of the CXO.  SAO has a unique and demonstrated pre-eminent capability in x-ray astronomy that iscritical to ensure that the science being conducted by the CXO Science Center issuccessfully completed.   SAOs technical expertise and knowledge in x-ray optics, x-rayinstrumentation and systems integration, its understanding of spacecraft observatoryrequirements for x-ray astronomy, and its scientific expertise in x-ray astrophysics makeSAO the unique source for continuing the CXO mission operations and data analysis effort. SAO has demonstrated its capabilities by applying highly specialized skills inperforming the CXC task for the CXO Program, enabling the CXO to achieve unparalleledsuccess in x-ray astronomy since its launch in July 1999.  As the CXC prime contractor,SAO has been responsible for developing and implementing the science and ground systemarchitecture as well as the challenging task of executing the scientific mission of theCXO.  SAO also has the detailed knowledge required to maintain the ground calibration ofinstruments that is necessary to ensure the proper interpretation of the on-orbit data. As a result, SAO has significant and irreplaceable knowledge of the program from allpossible vantage points  technical, scientific, managerial, and operational.  Overall,SAO is the only known source that has a sufficiently relevant and capable work force thatcan successfully achieve the challenging goals and objectives required to plan andconduct the CXO mission.Award of this requirement to a source other than SAO will result in unacceptable delaysin fulfilling NASA requirements.  It is emphasized that the CXO is a non-serviceableobservatory, and any science data that may be lost resulting from a transition to asuccessor contractor could not be recovered considering the limited observatory missionlife.  A transition to any other contractor would most certainly result in lowerefficiency and a direct loss of science, but even more crucially it would result in anincreased level of mission risk.  The CXO is a major and valuable asset to NASA and thescientific community having made or verified many fundamental observations anddiscoveries that are at the core of space science and cosmology in this era ofexploration.  The CXO is unique and its contributions cannot be fully replaced by anycurrent space-based or ground observatories.  A loss or degradation in its performancecannot be recovered or offset.	Since CXO is life-limited and non-serviceable, any lossof science time resulting from inefficiencies or transition problems cannot be recovered. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon December 8, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC) is an Air Cushion Vehicle (ACV), and is a future Navy craft for transporting vehicles, cargo, and personnel from ship-to-shore and/or seabase-to-shore.  It is the planned replacement for the current Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) as these craft reach the end of their service life.
The SSC Program has a validated Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  In December 2007, the Navy Resources, Requirements Review Board (R3B) selected the 73 Short Ton ACV concept as the SSC platform.  In April 2008, the SSC program completed a successful Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) and was authorized to start Preliminary Design (PD).  The program has completed a Set Based Design effort as a part of PD and has established a baseline design.  A Stakeholders Steering Board (SSB) concurred with the baseline design in November 2008 and PD Phase 1 is currently underway. A Preliminary Design Review (PDR) is anticipated in March 2009.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) for Detail Design and Construction (DD&C) is planned for release in FY10, with contract award expected in FY11.
The SSC will provide high speed, over the horizon, heavy lift capability to transport personnel, equipment, and material for the United States Marine Corps' Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) as established for year 2015 and beyond.  The SSC will have the ability to operate in the well decks of U.S. Navy amphibious ships, operate in planned amphibious and Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) ships, operate over beaches, ice, mud, and marsh areas, operate in inland regions, ascend a beach gradient of five degrees from standstill, and transport a cargo load of approximately 73-75 short tons.
Although specifications for the SSC are not finalized, it is assumed the SSC will have capability and performance similar to, or exceeding that of, the craft completing the LCAC Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).  For reference, the LCAC SLEP has a design payload of 140,000 pounds, a deck area of 1809 square feet, and a speed of 40+ knots at a design weight of 344,685 pounds in calm seas.  LCAC SLEP is operational through Sea State 3.  The following performance improvements for the SSC will be analyzed during development: ability to operate in higher sea state conditions; increased payload, range, and speed; reduced crew; reduced maintenance and operational costs; and increased reliability and maintainability. 
The SSC Program held previous Industry Day events in November 2005 and in July 2008.  
***Industry Day Event***Industry involvement is invited as the SSC Program continues the Technology Development Phase, having completed Set Based Design and the initiation of PD.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), located in Ann Arbor, Michigan is seeking to either 1)  procure up to seven new Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) OR, 2)  upgrade up to seven existing PEMS  to comply with 40 CFR, Part  1065.  The end result is that the EPA will have PEMS that have both gasoline and diesel emission measurement capabilities.
As part of the 2007 Heavy In-Use Rule and its Amendments and 40 CFR Part 1065, a variety of new emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines.  One of the requirements is to conduct on-vehicle emission measurements in the field in a manner that has minimal impact on the in-use vehicle.  The EPA NVFEL has undertaken a comprehensive program to implement new and refined test systems, including PEMS, to enhance the capabilities to conduct these tests with precision and accuracy, on a broad range of vehicles, both gasoline and diesel.
The new PEMS provided under any resulting contract (whether new units or upgraded Sensor?s Semtech-G units) shall conform to the requirements specified in the Statement of Work and the 40 CFR  Part 1065 requirements referenced in the SOW.    For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project, including configuration, design, fabrication, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, and documentation.  The contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO standards.
The NAICS is 334516.  This procurement will be conducted under the authority of  FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.     The requirement is conducted as full and open competition.  Award will be made on a Best Value basis.   Evaluation of proposals will include assessment of price, technical approach, experience and past performance.  For purposes of evaluating proposals, all evaluation criteria other than price, when combined, are approximately equal in importance to price.   The Government anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed Price type contract.    Point of Contact for this requirement is Linda Merryman, Contract Specialist, at (513) 487-2037, or via e-mail at merryman.linda@epa.gov.    A copy of the solicitation will be made available on FedBizOpps on or about December 10, 2008.    No paper copies of the solicitation will be provided.   Telephone requests will not be honored.  All responsible concerns may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice and NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) Solicitation.     The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Aviation Logistics Center, Elizabeth City, NC  intends to negotiate on a sole source basis using  the authority of FAR 6.302-1,  with Northrop Grumman Guidance and Electronics Company, Navigation Systems Division, Woodland Hills, CA to expand the capability and improve reliability of the Northrop Grumman Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) P/N 804950-3 used on USCG HC-130H aircraft.  Northrop Grumman is the Original Equipment Manufacturer of this equipment.  Drawings, specifications and technical data are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  Capability expansion efforts will involve incorporating the ability to obtain accurate Department of Defense-grade navigation information from the Global Position System (GPS).  Reliability improvement efforts will involve replacing the power module to better protect against electrical power fluctuations from the HC-130H aircraft.  The upgraded INU will be required to meet the same volume, power, and other physical interfaces with the HC-130H aircraft as they exist for the current HC-130 INU, while functional interfaces with the aircraft are expected to address the new GPS information.    The Coast Guard anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract using the procedures of FAR Part 12 in conjunction with FAR Part 15 and intends to issue the RFP Solicitation as an unrestricted procurement.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) is 334511 and the Small Business size standard is 750 employees.  It is anticipated a formal RFP Solicitation will be issued by mid-February 2009.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to release a solicitation to acquire Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) Block 2 upgrades in support of Transformational Satellite Communications (TSAT) S-Band operations, Wideband Global SATCOM  (WGS) Block 2 satellites, and other MILSATCOM programs.  In addition, CCS-C architecture extensions will support NetCentric command and control and Information Assurance requirements identified by Headquarters Air Force Space Command will be supported. The CCS-C development and deployment will support the launch, on-orbit operations, and anomaly resolution of the TSAT satellites from its command and control system through the AFSCN (Air Force Satellite Control Network). CCS-C capabilities include: activity planning; telemetry processing; commanding; orbit management; resource management; space vehicle and ground system simulation; support planning and execution; and interfaces with dedicated ground and payload control systems.  Satellite platform and payload state-of-health operations include launch, early-orbit, on-orbit, anomaly resolution, and disposal operations.  Future migration to USB (Unified S-Band) waveforms and data formats shall be supported.  Contractor must be able to sustain existing CCS-C hardware, software, databases, and command procedures.  Continuing upgrades to address Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and software obsolescence are anticipated.
The period of performance is anticipated to be for 10 years and will begin in FY09 lasting through FY19. This is a follow-on effort to the existing CCS-C development, procurement and support contract currently performed by Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 5000 Philadelphia Way, Lanham, MD 20706-4417.  The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is October 2008.  On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO and Vandenberg AFB, CA.  A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.  

Interested Contractors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 5:00 pm (Pacific) on Tuesday, 8 January 2008 demonstrating knowledge of CCS-C hardware and software design and test procedures.  The submission must also include an assessment of actual, potential, or perceptions of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) through the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan.  The mitigation plan will be evaluated to ensure proper safeguards are implemented or will be implemented to protect the Government's interests and to identify perceptions of bias and unmitigable OCIs in accordance with FAR 9.5. OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates.  Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of a competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also available upon request from the contracting officer, Herbert Countee. 

The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length.  This page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission  Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF Format.  All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP.  Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of a SOC.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether any prospective credible source other then the incumbent exists.  Responses from qualified small and small disadvantaged small businesses are highly encouraged. Submit all responses to synopsis to: SMC/MCSW/PK, Attn: Mr Herbert B. Countee, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., Suite 1467-A8, Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. Electronic submissions are acceptable and can be submitted to herb.countee@losangeles.af.mil.

<CONTACT>Patrick A. Thornton

<a href="mailto:Patrick.Thornton@pr.doe.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) seeks information for a suite of tools that can be utilized to enhance the management of Information Technology.  The objective of this initiative is to establish an interoperable suite of tools that support best practices in Capital Planning/Portfolio Management, Enterprise Architecture, E-Government, and Records Management to enable effective decision making and strategic planning.
This is a Request For Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP). The DOE intends to assess the capabilities and then issue an RFP at a later date. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that may follow.   Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such.
PURPOSEThe purpose of this RFI is to provide industry and government service providers with a vehicle to describe solutions and implementation approaches for achieving the goals of these focus areas through the implementation of an integrated solution.  This will enable DOE to incorporate strategies, alternatives, and experiences, representing best practices in developing and implementing a comprehensive solution for the management of Information Technology.  
The intent of the RFI response is to: &#61607;	Identify an integrated suite of tools that address Capital Planning/Portfolio Management, Enterprise Architecture, E-Government and Records Management processes. &#61607;	Ensure tools deployed provide sufficient technical capability to meet all relevant current and foreseeable IT investment data collection, analysis and reporting requirements&#61607;	Select and deploy software tools that assist senior leadership in making improved business decisions (e.g., improved access to information, data and analysis encourages proactive response to changing/evolving business conditions)&#61607;	Determine the feasibility of aligning the suite with Asset Management, Cyber Security (e.g. FISMA Reporting) Management, and Records Management toolsets and activities.
BACKGROUND?Capital assets should be compared against one another to create a prioritized portfolio of all major capital assets.  Just as an individual invests in a diverse portfolio of securities, agencies invest in a diverse portfolio of capital assets. For the individual investor, returns are measured in dividends or capital gains. While the benefits and costs of capital asset portfolios should be quantified in monetary terms when feasible, agencies also measure return on the basis of outputs and outcomes.? 
DOE continues to build upon the existing integration of Capital Planning, Enterprise Architecture, E-Government and Records Management processes and work.   DOE currently utilizes a number of software tools to support business operations, IT investment management, Enterprise Architecture, compliance activities (e.g., OMB reporting), E-Government, Records Management and other business functions performed by DOE OCIO.   The current software tools are installed in the DOE Data Center located in Germantown, Maryland.  The software tools are accessed by users through the native Internet and CITRIX (as appropriate) to provide an easily accessible and responsive interface for geographically dispersed DOE offices located throughout the continental United States.   The tools are utilized in a distributed and federated environment.  The users of these tools perform a variety of functions from user and system administration, analysis, and data entry.  In addition, DOE sites utilize a va riety of Enterprise Architecture and modeling tools which must be able to exchange repository data.
As an expected benefit, DOE is seeking to improve and enhance operational efficiencies, intra system integration with business decision-making processes and customer satisfaction.  
VISION The following describe the desired end-state for each of the solutions. 
&#61607;	Capital Planning & Portfolio Management ? To employ a Capital Planning and Investment software tool that will provide an easily understood and intuitive method for creating and maintaining IT Investment business case data. The solution will provide an easily accessible and responsive interface for geographically dispersed DOE offices located throughout the continental United States. It will provide DOE project managers and CIO Capital Planning staff project and portfolio analysis tools that enhance the efficient management of a DOE?s portfolio of IT investments.  Providing investment and portfolio dashboard summary displays.  The solution will provide for integrated information sharing capabilities between capital planning and enterprise architecture software tools.  &#61607;	Enterprise Architecture and E-Government ? An enterprise architecture and E-Government software solution that is comprehensive and capable of bringing together business, information, technology, and solutions architectures.  It will provide a Federated, collaborative model and document based management information used to support the Department in coordinating across diverse missions and leverage federal and industry best practices. 
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (SOO)
Your solution and approach should address these goals.&#61607;	Establish an enterprise architecture, (including business, data, and application, and technology layers) which conforms to the departmental (entire agency) enterprise architecture and supports the Lines of Business and Sub-Functions within the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) Reference Models.&#61607;	Project is well run and has resources in place to manage and implement it.&#61607;	Risk is reduced and managed throughout the Project.&#61607;	Security and privacy issues are identified.&#61607;	Project earns the value as planned for costs, schedule, and performance goals.&#61607;	Costs reflect formulation that includes all of the required resources and is risk adjusted to accommodate items addressed in the Risk Management plan.

<DESC><p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />FOR<br />THE MODERNIZED HISTORICAL CLIMATOLOGY NETWORK (HCN-M)
<p>1.0 Points of Contact<br />1.1 Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR)<br />Cheryl Ward</p>
<p>2.0 Title <br />MODERNIZED HISTORICAL CLIMATOLOGY NETWORK (HCN-M)</p>
<p>3.0 Description:</p>
<p>The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is modernizing 1,000 stations in the Modernized Historical Climatology Network (HCN-M), a regional system of ground-based observing sites that collect climate, weather and water measurements (http://cdiac.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/HCN-M/newHCN-M.html) (See Exhibit C). NOAA's goal is to collaborate the data collection of the HCN-M in-situ observing stations with the United States Climate Reference Network (USCRN) to deliver consistently accurate, high-quality data to climate scientists and other users of data studying climate trends. The modernization of the HCN-M will enhance the extent of America's premier data source for tracking regional climate variations and trends. The HCN-M will contribute to U.S. Integrated Earth Observation System (IEOS) and the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS) concept of operations by improving the design, integration, and operation of current HCN-M stations.</p>
<p>The modernization of the HCN-M is following a "climate-region" approach, starting with the Southwest Climate Region (CO, AZ, UT, NM) (See Exhibit A). Deployment of HCN-Modernized (HCN-M) sites in one climate region will be completed before moving to the next climate region (See Exhibit B). HCN-M sites will be deployed along an evenly spaced grid to ensure proper spatial density. HCN-M sites will be equipped with sensors and supporting equipment to collect and transmit three independent measurements of temperature and three independent measurements of liquid precipitation.</p>
<p>The primary requirement for the HCN-M is to produce quality climate observations for sustaining the nation's regional climate record in support of monitoring and assessment of the surface climate. To accomplish this, all stations collect surface air temperature and precipitation measurements. Some sites also measure soil temperature and moisture, snowfall and depth, snow water-equivalent (SWE), evaporation and other localized weather phenomena. These observations are collected manually by volunteers on a daily basis and transmitted at many places each day. All sites mail their official forms monthly to their supervising National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Forecast Office (WFO) before final disposition to National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), where the data is quality controlled, archived, and used for climate monitoring and dissemination to NOAA's customers. <br /><br />The HCN-M detects regional climate changes in addition to contributing to the understanding of local climate variability. Therefore, only those locations not influenced to any substantial degree by artificial changes of local environments are included in the network. Additionally, 59 of the sites in the HCN-M are first order weather stations, i.e., Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS), which will not be incorporated into this project since they have already been modernized</p>
<p>4.0 Description of Information Requested:</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to solicit information from industry with proven expertise in deploying observing networks in order to conduct market research for determining the development approach for HCN-M.</p>
<p>The Project Office is requesting information to support the development of the HCN-M project system and transition into operations. This project will deliver modernization of the sites, commissioning the system into operations, and the development of supporting documentation. Maintenance and quality assurance and quality control procedures are not required responses for the purposes of this RFI.</p>
<p>5.0 Background:</p>
<p>NOAA has a legislative mandate to collect environmental observations for the purpose of describing and monitoring the climate of the United States ). NOAA is also striving to improve monitoring of regional climate change and variability, providing more accurate weather forecasts and warnings, and climate outlooks for the protection of life and property of its citizens (NOAA Strategic Plan, 2005). The HCN-M was identified in response to the need for the most accurate, unbiased, modern historical climate record available for climate change research. The Carbon Dioxide Research Program of the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) and NCDC of NOAA identified a network of 1,221 stations in the contiguous United States for the specific purpose of compiling a data set suitable for detecting and monitoring climate change over the past two centuries.</p>
<p><br />For the purpose of supporting immediate operational needs of the Weather and Water (W&amp;W) and the Commerce and Transportation (C&amp;T) Goals, HCN-M data will be processed through the Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System (MADIS) transition system within the NWS Telecommunications Operations Center (TOC). To meet the Climate Goal requirements and preserve the integrity and fidelity of the historical climate record, HCN-M transmitted data will be delivered, unaltered, directly from the HCN-M site to NCDC for processing through the climate level quality control system. In order to ensure that operational and climate uses begin with an identical set of values, NCDC will determine and document a set of procedures and algorithms to Quality Control (QC) raw observations and produce a basic data product. These procedures will be managed under configuration control. These NCDC QC'd data will be merged with existing historical data adding to the archived data record.</p>
<p>The general service requirements are prioritized as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Sustain the climate record ensuring continuity of record and associated NOAA publications.<br />&bull; Provide information to NWS field offices and national centers from HCN-M sites to meet the daily issuance of products and services.<br />&bull; Provide 5 minute reports of ambient temperature and precipitation reports from each site at least hourly and daily and monthly (if daily data missed) transmittal of HCN-M data records <br />&bull; Document and preserve metadata and make it readily accessible to customers including both operational components and all maintenance records.</p>

2.	INTRODUCTION TO PIH AND PASS

The Department of Housing and Urban (HUD), Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH), is seeking a contractor to provide development, maintenance and operational support services for its Physical Assessment Sub-System (PASS).

The Department of Housing and Urban (HUD), Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH), oversees the Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC), which is responsible for capturing, standardizing, improving and evaluating data arising from the portfolio of properties for which HUD has a financial interest or statutory obligation to monitor.  PIH-REAC assesses the physical and financial condition, resident satisfaction, management operations, quality assurance, and other information originating from the following major components of HUDs program participant base:

	Public Housing Agencies (PHAs)
	Multi-Family (MF) Housing properties

The PIH-REAC is responsible for capturing, standardizing, improving, and evaluating data from the portfolio of properties for which HUD has a financial interest or statutory obligation to monitor.  The REAC assesses the following areas: 1) physical condition, 2) financial condition, 3) management capability, and 4) tenant satisfaction surveys Public Housing and Housing Multifamily properties.  The Physical Assessment Sub-system provides the means to assess the physical condition of properties in the HUD portfolio.  PASS is the cornerstone of the PIH-REAC suite of products and is the largest most complex subsystem in the inventory.

The key business functions supported by PASS include: (1) the collection of profile data for all public housing and multifamily properties for which HUD has a statutory obligation or a financial interest, and (2) the inspection of these properties which provides the capability to assess their physical condition.  The need for these business functions surfaced to assist in improving the quality of property conditions and achieve HUDs mandate

The Physical Assessment Subsystem (PASS) collects data and reports the actual state of repair and habitability of the real property.  The inspection observations are recorded on a hand-held computer using HUD developed and HUD owned software and sent electronically to PIH-REAC for scoring, analysis, and processing.

4.	DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS

4.1	Established Development Workload

PASS is currently being re-engineered from the current Cold Fusion environment to leverage Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE).  J2EE defines the standard for developing multi-tier enterprise applications. The J2EE platform makes enterprise applications development easier by establishing them on standardized, modular components, by providing a complete set of services to those components, and by handling many details of application activities automatically. 

The J2EE platform leverages many features of the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE), such as "Write Once, Run Anywhere" portability, JDBC API for database access, technology for interaction with existing enterprise resources, and a security model that protects data even in internet applications. Building on this base, the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition adds full support for Enterprise JavaBeans components, Java Servlets API, JavaServer Pages and XML technology.

The Physical Assessment Sub-System does not currently have a dynamic interface with other Major Application systems, but is reliant on batch data transfers from other systems such as NASS, REMS and other REAC systems, as well as furnishing batch data to other HUD systems.

End users can access the PASS Information Center through the Internet or by using HUDs Intranet.  Access to The Physical Assessment Sub-System is secured and requires a user ID and password, which are granted on an as needed basis by the security administrator.  If permission is granted, security administrators will provide the end users with very specific access only to relevant sub-modules within the system.

4.2	Future Development Workload

For future development work the offeror must experience providing design and development services for complex and large-scale information technology systems in a Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) supporting Enterprise JavaBeans components, Java Servlets API, Java Server Pages and XML technology on a Oracle environment. Future work will include but is not limited to the following PASS business modules.

6.	CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS 
The Contractor shall perform all development and maintenance activities in accordance with PIH-REACs Configuration Management Plan.  The plan, which may be found at http://hudatwork.hud.gov/po/reac/products/DCG/docs_guide.cfm, addresses several topics including the following:
Configuration Management:  Configuration management is a set of processes to identify configuration items, baseline configuration items and control changes to that configuration baseline.  
Change Management:  Change management identifies and defines steps for initiating a Software Change Request (SCR) that may alter the existing Software Configuration Items (SCI).  
Change Requests (CR) and Problem Reports (PR): Primary mechanism to initiate a change to the existing requirements or report a problem occurring in the system.
Release Management:  Release management consists of specific processes that manage the risks associated with each of the four PIH release categories:  major releases, feature releases, defect releases and emergency releases.  
Problem Tracking:  SCRs, CRs and PRs are submitted to the CCB for evaluation and approval.  Upon CCB approval, the subsystem that submitted the SCR, CR or PR provides an assessment package for the appropriate release.   
7.	REPORTING OR OTHER PROGRESS/COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

The project has various reporting requirements including weekly status reports, monthly status reports, and the reporting of all problems, flaws and deficiencies.

The contractor is responsible for submitting various plans including a Project Management Plan (PMP), Transition Plan, Risk Management Plan, Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan, and System Security Plan.  The contractor is also required to comply with the Earned Value Management processes.

The PMP consists of 4 parts:
	Project Plan;
	Transition Plan;
	Risk Management Plan; and
	Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan.

The Project Plan shall include a narrative that:
a.	Describes the staffing resources allocated to each task; and
b.	Provides the rationale for the project organization, staff utilization and other resources allocated to each task or activity.

Contractor shall use Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) categories that breakdown work packages into activities of 80 to 100 hours of effort.  Each activity will result in a milestone associated with a particular deliverable.  

The Risk Management Plan shall:
a.	Describe each individual risk to include the source of the risk and the trigger (or symptom) of the risk;
b.	Determine the impact of the risk in terms of cost and schedule;
c.	Document procedures to manage the risk; and
d.	Assign responsibility for risk monitoring and contingency plan implementation to those identified at the PMR or Risk Management planning session.

The Quality Control Plan shall:
a.	Identify the Contractors standards that are applicable to this effort;
b.	Include procedures for complying with those standards;
c.	Identify techniques and metrics for measuring compliance; and
d.	Include an approach for eliminating the causes of unsatisfactory/unacceptable performance.

With each major release, the system security plan (SSP) should be enhanced and updated to reflect security issues arising out of the new release or that have been identified since the plan was last updated.  The purpose of the SSP is to document all of the security controls that are in place, whether built into the system or managed by personnel who operate the system or use its output.  The SSP must meet the standards set by NIST Special Security Publication 800-18.  

Contractor is required to adhere to the Earned Value Analysis management and reporting procedures as stated in the ANSI 748 Standard.

<DESC>The Defense Intelligence Operations Coordination Center (DIOCC) located at the Defense Intelligence Analysis Center (DIAC) Bolling AFB, Washington DC is seeking sources to perform national level technical GEOINT collection management services in support of the DIOCC.  Customers will include DIA, the combatant commands and defense policy-makers. 

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL NOR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS, AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE AN ORDER  / CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.

The primary goals for this service support is to procure continued services of system experts who will:

(1) help train government civilian and military personnel in collection strategy development, procedures governing GEOINT collection management, and use of the various GEOINT collection management tools,

These positions require an intimate knowledge of the evolution of Geospatial-Intelligence Information Management Services (GIMS) and implementation plans and transition efforts.  Services require travel to select combatant commands, as well as travel to local Washington DC area locations.

The Government anticipates releasing a single solicitation from which multiple contracts may be awarded.  Requirements in the solicitation will be divided on a functional basis.

<DESC><p>The Air Force is continuing to prepare for the Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling (FFS AR) Pilot Program that is part of the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act. This notice is provided as a "heads up" to inform industry of a forthcoming update to this Special Notice announcing a FFS AR Industry Day at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base the week of 15 December 2008.
<p>This Industry Day is a market research tool to address the proposed Concept of Employment (CONEMP) for the Pilot Program as well as to determine the commercial availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any acquisition strategy. The acquisition strategy/plan has not been finalized.</p>
<p>Further details regarding this upcoming Industry Day will be posted in the near future as an update to this notice. The FedBizOpps web site has a registration feature on this page where you can register to receive email notifications of any FFS AR program updates. If you choose not to register for these automatic e-mail update notices you can continue to check this website for further updates.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or commitment of any kind. The Government will not reimburse interested sources or responders to this notice (or to documents posted under this announcement) for any costs incurred in responding, or for subsequent exchanges of information. Information submitted does not constitute a proposal, but will be considered an exchange of capabilities and ideas.<br />Any further updates to this activity will be posted to this website.</p>

<DESC>The US Navy has a requirement for portable Sterile Tube Welder for use with portable blood banking system.  Unit should be no greater than 11 L X 4 W X 2.5 H and weighing less than 4lbs. Run on 120 VAC power with a power cable of at least six feet in length.  I conducted a market research and found that there were several manufacturers who made portable Sterile Tube Welders.   Of those manufacturers, found that Genesis BPS is the only manufacturer that makes a portable Sterile Tube Welder that meets the requirements.  This unit was previously procured on an IDIQ through Haemonetics as part of the blood banking cell washing system.  In compliance with the Commands initiative to enhance Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) for Fleet applications, the only technically acceptable item that has (ILS) support is the Sterile Tube Welder manufactured by Genesis BPS.  This unit has been standardized for all  fleet platforms as part of the portable blood banking system.  The installed base is currently in more than half of the ships in the fleet as well as each new ship that is being built.   These items were standardized to maintain interoperability between all ships.  The choice of any other manufacturer would result in a breakdown of that interoperability between fleet assets and reduce the lifesaving capability of each ship.  The list above identifies the equipment and accessories that must be procured to satisfy the needs of the government.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Tactical Technology Office (TTO), intends to award a Sole Source contract to The Boeing Company, Philadelphia, PA for continuation (Phase 1) of DiscRotor Program. The DiscRotor concept is an aircraft with a relatively small hub-mounted disc that can extend rotor blades to affect vertical flight. The Boeing Company conducted a Phase 0 (DARPA Seedling/Concept Study) DiscRotor research effort under Contract No. HR0011-07-C-0076. The Boeing Companys Phase 0 effort was competitively selected in response to DARPA BAA 06-15 Tactical Technology Office (Office-wide).  Under this Phase 0 contract, The Boeing Company, teamed with Virginia Polytechnical Institute, conducted DiscRotor trade studies, design refinement, mechanical systems conceptual layout, wind tunnel testing, hover rig testing, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and risk reduction planning, providing an initial assessment of performance and flying qualities. The proposed DiscRotor Phase I Program effort is a logical follow-on to the prior effort conducted by The Boeing Company and the Virginia Polytechnical Institute and will also lean on lessons learned from The Boeing Companys earlier Canard Rotor Wing (CRW) program. Phase I will conduct enabling technology demonstrations  including wind tunnel testing of a small scale (manually) extendable rotor system and, subsequently, a large scale (automatically) extendable rotor system  in order to establish critical feasibility of the DiscRotor concept. Additionally, the Boeing Company team will conduct DiscRotor configuration and performance refinement, consider mission survivability issues, and develop options for a flying DiscRotor demonstrator. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  As the developer of the DiscRotor concept, The Boeing Company team possesses unique knowledge, capabilities and proprietary intellectual property/data required to carry out the required research effort.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Responses/proposals received within forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by submitting a white paper and past performance data by no later than 20 October 2008 to The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Attn: Mr. Michael Blackstone, Contracts Management Office (CMO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 or via email to michael.blackstone@darpa.mil. Questions shall be submitted to the above email address.  Please refer to Numbered Note 22.
It is noted that DARPAs Tactical Technology Office (TTO) maintains an annual Office-wide Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeking system and subsystem level technologies that enable revolutionary improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the military.  The Land, Air, Sea and Space Platforms mission thrust area under this BAA specifically seeks proposals for innovative technologies and design approaches for vertical flight aircraft rotors and rotor systems such as The Boeing Companys DiscRotor concept/program.  Parties wishing to respond to this notice are invited, as an alternative, to submit a white paper against DARPA BAA 08-31.

<DESC><p>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Aerojet Ordnance Tennessee, Inc. (AOT), 1367 Old State Route 34, Jonesborough, TN, 37659-6315. AFRL/RWMI desires to purchase the following: A) 765 pounds of unalloyed tungsten cubes, sintered to a density of greater than 18.4 g/cc military grade tungsten (400 pounds sized 5/16 inch cubed, plus or minus 0.010 inch tolerance; 65 pounds sized 5/8 inch cubed, plus or minus 0.010 inch tolerance; 300 pounds sized 3/8 inch cubed, plus or minus 0.010 inch tolerance). B) 235 pounds of Ta-2.5W cubes, manufactured from rolled plate per ASTM B708-01 R05255 (175 pounds sized 5/16 inch cubed, plus or minus 0.010 inch tolerance; 60 pounds sized 5/8 inch cubed, plus or minus 0.010 inch tolerance). In order for the overall material testing program to have validity and continuity, it is mandatory that the above described test materials are the exact same composition as previously tested tungsten and tantalum, and AOT was the supplier of these previous test materials. Additionally, the material properties of the required materials must have the same mechanically strengthened and heat treated processes applied under the same conditions as previously tested materials.

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractors date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term working day excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

This notice constitutes solicitation AG-0116-S-09-0012 and is being issued as a Request for Proposals.  This notice and any incorporated provisions include those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26 date June 2, 2008.  Proposals are being solicited from Small Business Concerns only.  The NAICS code associated with this acquisition is 541990 and the small business size standard for that code is: $6.5 million average receipts over the past three years.  

The government has a requirement for planning, conducting, and facilitation of multiple collaborative recreation use planning meetings for the U.S. Forest Service, Ketchikan-Misty Fiords Ranger District (KMRD).  The selected individual or team will provide independent and impartial facilitation services for the public participation component of a recreation and commercial use planning process.  The focus of this effort will be to work with the Forest Service and interested stakeholder representatives to strategically plan, design, and facilitate an effective public participation process.  This process will generally follow the Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) process to develop desired future conditions on the Forest, recommend standards and indicators to monitor those conditions, and consider alternatives for the appropriate amount of commercial outfitter/guide use by area of the District.  Information collected during the collaborative process will be used to develop a Proposed Action and alternatives during the NEPA process (the NEPA process is not part of this solicitation).

The KMRD encompasses approximately 3.2 million acres, of which 2.1 million acres are congressionally-designated wilderness.  The growth of the tourism industry in and around Ketchikan has created an increase in the number of applications and authorizations for commercial use of the Forest by outfitter/guide companies.  The Forest Service issues outfitter/guide permits in response to the management need to provide high-quality public services and assistance to visitors and meet Forest Plan management objectives. 

The goal of the meetings will be to work collaboratively with the public, tribes, local organizations, and government agencies to identify desired future conditions for 17 proposed recreational areas on the KMRD, identify indicators and standards for monitoring those conditions, and propose an appropriate level of commercial use that should be authorized in these areas.

Meetings will take place once a month for nine months, beginning in January, 2009 and ending in September, 2009.  These meetings will be scheduled at least one month in advance.  Each meeting will last at least approximately 2-4 hours.  All meetings will occur in Ketchikan, Alaska.  Proposals shall be based on the assumption of a total of nine meetings.

Meeting agendas will be designed strategically by the KMRD staff and contractor.  Project sideboards (e.g. Forest Plan guidelines) and standard operating procedures will be designed to address meeting processes and procedures.  

The selected contractor shall:

(1)  Plan/design a collaborative public participation strategy that follows Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) guidelines.  Contractor will work with KMRD staff to design a suitable public participation approach based on the LAC process.  Contractor will also work closely with KMRD staff to determine goals, approaches, and logistics for the public participation strategy.

(2)  In cooperation with KMRD staff, develop and prepare the meeting agendas, outlining how the meetings will be managed, reviewing the goals and objectives for each session, and reviewing information that will be presented and discussed at each meeting, direct and focus discussions so that the agenda for each meeting is accomplished in a timely manner, handle conflicts as they arise, and keep meetings on schedule.

(3)  Prepare and provide written meeting summary reports in MS Word format within 5 working days of each meeting occurrence that include the meeting agenda, notes, and evaluation.  The Contractor will work with KMRD staff to determine how to best document and summarize meeting events and record individual comments or overall discussion points, at each stage in the process.  Contractor will also work with KMRD staff and meeting participants to evaluate the meetings for the purposes of identifying lessons learned and to improve future meetings. 

The Contractor shall be responsible for all travel related expenses for the contractor and/or contractors employees.

The Government will provide all meeting facilities, meeting materials such as flip charts, audio-visual equipment, markers, meeting sign-in sheets, and other necessary materials, appropriate background information for each meeting, distribution of handouts to meeting participants, and posting of information to the project website.  The Government will also provide a notetaker(s) for the meetings.

The US Forest Service is interested in conducting a study to develop signage guidelines for motorized trails. The purpose of the study is to determine appropriate sign size, sign height, reflective sign material, and how far away the sign should be placed from a hazard to warn and instruct the rider to take an appropriate action under various climatic and environmental conditions. This will be done by determining reaction time of riders and stopping distances for OHVs under various physical conditions of the trail and human influences.

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />Multiple-probe, high-frequency (up to 50 GHz) scanning probe system for nanometer-scale, spatially-resolved characterization of candidate devices for "beyond-CMOS" applications, including magnetic, spintronic devices. The system should operate in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and at temperatures between 30 K and 300 K. The system should be compatible with magnetic fields of up to 500 Oe (40 kA/m) applied in the plane of the sample device. The system should provide high frequency signal paths to a planar sample device via each of the probes. At least one of the probes should function as a "fully scannable" scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with lateral spatial resolution ~1 nm. The system will be used in a research environment with low throughput.</p>
<p>The detailed specifications given below consist of a "core" system specification (items 1 through 13) and four optional specifications (items 14 through 17). The "core" system and each of the four options should be quoted separately.</p>
<p>The specifications are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Vacuum System<br />1.1 The sample, probes, probe tips, and scanning stage must be housed in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber that should be made from either AISI type 304 or 316 stainless steel.<br />1.2 The chamber must have an ultimate operating pressure of the system &lt; 5 x 10-10 Torr (6.6 x 10-8 Pa). The system must include the appropriate vacuum pumps necessary to reach this ultimate pressure. All system components inside the vacuum chamber, including but not limited to probes, probe tips, scanning stage, samples, electrical wiring, and thermal radiation shielding must be compatible with this ultimate operating pressure.<br />1.3 The chamber and all vacuum system components must be bake-able to at least 150 &deg;C.<br />1.4 The system must include suitable vacuum gauging to determine the system base pressure and to monitor the pressure during pump down, bake-out, and operation.<br />1.5 The vacuum chamber should include at least two ports that provide line-of-sight access to the sample. These ports might later be used for sample dosing with e.g. small quantities of molecules in gas phase or illumination of the sample with e.g. focused laser light.</p>
<p>2. Low Temperature / Variable Temperature Operation<br />2.1 The system must operate in three temperature regimes: (A) liquid He regime, with ultimate sample temperature less than 30 K (B) liquid N2 regime (C) room temperature regime. The ultimate sample temperature in regime (A) should be stable to 0.05 K. Both the sample and the tip should be cooled.<br />2.2 The system must be cooled via a liquid cryogen: liquid He or liquid N2. Provided with 100 liters of liquid He, the system should capable of being cooled from room temperature to the lowest operating temperature and subsequently operating at the lowest operating temperature for at least 48 additional hours.<br />2.3 The system must include suitable temperature gauging to determine the system temperature during cool-down and operation. Multiple temperature monitors at different positions within the system are desirable.</p>
<p>3. Probes<br />3.1 The system must include four probes. Each probe must be capable of contact electrical measurements, with the contact point of the probe being provided by a sharp metal tip, e.g. a tip that is similar to a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip.<br />3.2 Each probe must be capable of being independently scanned in three dimensions. The combined lateral (X Y) coarse positioning range of all probes should provide access to 1 cm X 1 cm sample area. The lateral (X Y) coarse positioning resolution should be 100 nm or better.<br />3.3 At least one of the probes must function as a non-contact, "fully scannable" probe. Specifically, the "fully scannable" probe(s) should function as STM(s) with ~1 nm lateral spatial resolution and 1 &micro;m X 1 &micro;m scanning range. Any remaining probes that are not fully scannable should be upgradeable to "fully scannable" probes at a future date.<br />3.4 Probes must be replaceable while the system is under vacuum. The system must include the appropriate components for probe replacement, e.g. wobble stick(s).</p>
<p>4. Sample and Tip: Preparation and Exchange<br />4.1 The system must accommodate samples of lateral dimensions between 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm and 1 cm x 1 cm and thicknesses up to 2 mm.<br />4.2 The system must accommodate probe tips of various materials commonly used in scanning probe systems, including, but not limited to tungsten, silver, and platinum iridium.<br />4.3 The system should include a mechanism for cleaning the tips, e.g. by sputtering and/or annealing. The tip-cleaning system may be housed within the main chamber, within the load-lock chamber, or within the optional preparation chamber (see item 17, below).<br />4.4 The system should include a mechanism for cleaning samples, e.g. by sputtering and/or annealing. The sample-cleaning system may be housed within the main chamber, within the load-lock chamber, or within the optional preparation chamber (see item 17, below).<br />4.5 The system must include a mechanism for exchanging tips/tip holders and samples/sample holders in and out of the multiprobe scanner without venting the main chamber, e.g. via wobble stick. If specialized sample or tip holders are required, the system should include spare sample / tip holders.<br />4.6 The system must include a mechanism for exchanging tips and samples between the chamber and atmosphere without venting the main chamber, e.g. a load lock and a linear manipulator.</p>
<p>5. Magnetic Compatibility - Core Requirement<br />5.1 The system must be compatible with magnetic fields between 0 Oe (0 A/m) and 500 Oe (40 kA/m) applied to sample. The sample chuck as well as the scanning probes and all relevant supporting structures should be made from non-magnetic materials. Specifically, the relative position between the probe tips and the sample should drift less than 100 nm as the field is adjusted continuously between 0 Oe and 500 Oe.<br />5.2. The system must accommodate magnetic coils that will supply the magnetic field described in 5.1 (for instance by providing space as well as feed-throughs for the DC current). The magnetic coils will be designed, manufactured, and installed by NIST. NOTE: Core requirement 5.2 will be superseded if NIST elects to purchase Option B (described in item 15 below).</p>
<p>6. High frequency Compatibility - Core Requirement<br />6.1 The system must provide appropriate vacuum feed-throughs to allow high frequency signals (up to 50 GHz) to be transmitted into the chamber. The connectors on either side of the feed-through should be 2.4 mm ("K") type coaxial connectors or easily adaptable to 2.4 mm connectors.<br />6.2 The system must accommodate high-frequency electrical cabling and custom high-frequency probes that will provide a signal path from the feed-throughs described in 6.1 to the tips in the probes. The high-frequency electrical cabling and custom high-frequency probes will be designed, manufactured, and installed by NIST. NOTE: Core requirement 6.2 will be superseded if NIST elects to purchase Option C (described in item 16 below).</p>
<p>7. Vibration Isolation<br />7.1 The system must include appropriate vibration isolation mechanisms to achieve and maintain an STM scanning resolution of ~1 nm.</p>
<p>8. Interfacing: Control Hardware and Software<br />8.1. The system must include appropriate control interfacing hardware and software for controlling the coarse positioning and contact electrical measurements with the probes.<br />8.2. The system must include appropriate control interfacing hardware and software for controlling the STM functionality of the "fully scannable" probe(s). In addition to standard STM topographical images, the software should also be able to record user-supplied signals as a function of probe position.<br />8.3 The system must include any personal computer(s) required to run the interfacing hardware or software described above. Moreover, such personal computer(s) shall either: (A) be capable of operating in a "stand-alone" configuration where the personal computer is NOT connected to a local-area-network or (B) be compatible with United States Department of Commerce and NIST regulations regarding personal computer network connections at the time of installation.</p>
<p>9. Utilities<br />9.1 The system must require standard 120 V AC or 208 V 3 phase AC connections. <br />9.2 In the places where connectors for dc or high-frequency electrical signals, gas, cooling water, compressed air, or cryogens are required, the system must use standard (non-custom) connectors.<br />9.3 The system must include appropriate mechanisms such as gate valves, solenoid valves, and backup power supplies to protect the vacuum and electrical systems in the event of power disruption.</p>
<p>10. Pumping systems<br />10.1 The high-vacuum pumps may include cryo-pumps, ion pumps, or turbo pumps. "MagLev" turbo pumping is desirable. Backing pumps may be dry pumps or oil pumps, but dry pumps are preferred to oil pumps.</p>
<p>11. Demonstration of prior delivery and successful operation of similar systems<br />11.1 NIST requires references to establish the previous delivery and successful operation of systems with similar capability to the one requested. Information should be provided demonstrating the performance of the proposed system.</p>
<p>12. Safety<br />12.1 The system must include all necessary interlocks on high-voltage supplies and vacuum systems to insure that the system presents no safety hazards.<br />12.2 The system must meet OSHA standards for operator safety.</p>
<p>13.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103.  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

OTI country programs are designed and managed in Washington, with substantial input and oversight from field-based staff.  OTI annually operates ten to twelve country programs on three continents with an average budget of $100 million and 90 staff in Washington and in the field.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the offices programmatic goals and objectives.  

OTIs Field Programs Division (FPD) develops, oversees, and manages OTI country programs and field staff, to include all programming responsibilities and authorities, and start-up and close out of OTI country programs.  FPD staff regularly engage with counterparts in USAID Missions overseas, USAID Regional Bureaus in Washington, the Department of State, other bilateral donors, international governmental and non-governmental organizations, and other entities engaged in post-conflict and political transition issues.  The FPD provides expertise and technical support for OTI country programs, USAID Missions, and other USG offices abroad and represents OTI in intra/inter-agency sector-specific dialogue and debate.  

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to hire a Regional Team Leader to lead one of USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) regional teams in the management of existing country programs and conduct new country program assessments as the need arises.  OTI currently has three regional teams within the Field Programs Division: Africa (AFR), Asia and Middle East (AME), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC).  Under this solicitation, the Regional Team Leader is initially expected to manage the AFR team.  This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus the vast majority of time on country program implementation.

OBJECTIVE

The objectives for this position are to (1) ensure the designated USAID/DCHA/OTI 
regional team is managed effectively in Washington and the field (effectively manage and supervise OTI Program Manager staff in Washington, and OTI Country Representatives in the field), and (2) ensure US government funds are spent wisely, in coordination with other key actors, and in a manner that reflects OTI standard practice, and USG policy. 

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

The Regional Team Leader will be based in Washington and will report to the OTIs Chief of Field Programs Division or his/her designee.  The Regional Team Leader's principal responsibility will be the oversight and management of specific DCHA/OTI country programs in one of OTI's three geographic regions.  The initial assignment for this position will be with the Africa (AFR) Regional Team.  Currently OTI/AFR is overseeing four Country Programs in Africa (see OTI website for more specific detail).

The Regional Team Leader must be an individual with sound judgment, excellent communication, interpersonal and analytical skills, and a well-developed understanding of USG policy interests.  The successful candidate must have a strong interest in assisting countries undergoing political transition and be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice.  Since work may require continual changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of continual change.  Further, the Regional Team Leader must be experienced in managing different aspects of transition program operations in order to mentor program staff, and ensure that all processes and procedures are being followed so that program implementation is effective and efficient.

The incumbent must demonstrate creativity, excellent communications, leadership and analytical skills, and the ability to operate with high levels of autonomy, responsibility, and authority, while exercising sound judgment in politically charged situations.  The candidate must be mature, self-reliant, a team player as well as a leader, and a problem-solver.  S/he will have management experience, and understand budgeting and financial management.  The successful candidate will be able to communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, USG agencies, other donor entities, the United Nations, and other international organizations, and have experience working for, or closely with, USAID or another USG office in the field.  S/he must also be able to work efficiently and effectively in a bureaucracy where frequent changes may occur.  

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The incumbent serves as OTIs principal expert on country program issues related to the region of assignment.  A majority of the duties listed below are related to management and supervision of program funded personal, and the development, oversight, and management of OTIs country programs.  It is important that the Regional Team Leader quickly familiarize her/himself in the key tasks of the country team members in order to ensure that primary tasks are carried out appropriately and efficiently.

The Regional Team Leaders duties will include but not be limited to:

	Lead and manage the Regional Team, including the management and supervision of Program Manager staff in Washington and Country Representatives in the field, as well as Implementing Partner contracts and grants at the headquarter level.  (Note that OTI Country Representatives in the field directly supervise additional field staff, and responsibility for managing implementing partners at the headquarter level may be delegated to trained Program Manager staff in Washington.);

	Oversee the design and implementation of new country program operations to include complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries, including the effective oversight of management, logistical, budget, administrative, human resources, and contractual issues;

	Conceptualize and design, in close coordination with lower and higher-ranking USAID and other USG officials, OTI country program strategies and determine appropriate USAID funding levels and requirements;

	Supervise the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives, including overseeing and/or managing the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and Personal Service Contract employees;

	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives, ensure staff work objectives and tasks are well defined, and ensure recruitment is initiated immediately when staffing needs arise.  Ensure staff are highly qualified and trained and mentored in all critical aspects of OTI operations and programming. Ensure employee performance evaluations are completed in a timely manner in accordance with OTI office policy;

	Negotiate, oversee and manage the overall Regional Team country budgets and ensure the Regional Team procurement plan is kept up to date.  It is critical to ensure that country programs are appropriately budgeted for.  Additional responsibilities include working to secure additional funding from other USG sources if required, and ensuring that the team is trained on all the appropriate systems and tools for budgeting, finance and procurement;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION EXTENDS THE SUSPENSE DATE FOR THE SOC SUBMISSION TO FRIDAY, 11 JANUARY 2008
The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to release a solicitation to acquire Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) Block 2 upgrades in support of Transformational Satellite Communications (TSAT) S-Band operations, Wideband Global SATCOM  (WGS) Block 2 satellites, and other MILSATCOM programs.  In addition, CCS-C architecture extensions will support NetCentric command and control and Information Assurance requirements identified by Headquarters Air Force Space Command will be supported. The CCS-C development and deployment will support the launch, on-orbit operations, and anomaly resolution of the TSAT satellites from its command and control system through the AFSCN (Air Force Satellite Control Network). CCS-C capabilities include: activity planning; telemetry processing; commanding; orbit management; resource management; space vehicle and ground system simulation; support planning and execution; and interfaces with dedicated ground and payload control systems.  Satellite platform and payload state-of-health operations include launch, early-orbit, on-orbit, anomaly resolution, and disposal operations.  Future migration to USB (Unified S-Band) waveforms and data formats shall be supported.  Contractor must be able to sustain existing CCS-C hardware, software, databases, and command procedures.  Continuing upgrades to address Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and software obsolescence are anticipated.  

The period of performance is anticipated to be for 10 years and will begin in FY09 lasting through FY19. This is a follow-on effort to the existing CCS-C development, procurement and support contract currently performed by Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 5000 Philadelphia Way, Lanham, MD 20706-4417.  The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is October 2008.  On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO and Vandenberg AFB, CA.  A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.  

Interested Contractors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 5:00 pm (Pacific) on Friday, 11 January 2008 demonstrating knowledge of CCS-C hardware and software design and test procedures.  The submission must also include an assessment of actual, potential, or perceptions of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) through the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan.  The mitigation plan will be evaluated to ensure proper safeguards are implemented or will be implemented to protect the Government's interests and to identify perceptions of bias and unmitigable OCIs in accordance with FAR 9.5. OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates.  Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of a competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also available upon request from the contracting officer, Herbert Countee. 

The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length.  This page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission  Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF Format.  All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP.  Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of a SOC.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether any prospective credible source other then the incumbent exists.  Responses from qualified small and small disadvantaged small businesses are highly encouraged. Submit all responses to synopsis to: SMC/MCSW/PK, Attn: Mr Herbert B. Countee, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., Suite 1467-A8, Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. Electronic submissions are acceptable and can be submitted to herb.countee@losangeles.af.mil.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR), Naval Air Warfare and Weapons Department (ONR 35) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for conduct of basic research in technology areas relevant to rotorcraft. As basic research, proposed projects should develop new scientific knowledge, improve theoretical understanding, and provide a basis for advances in rotorcraft technology. Research topics should focus on basic scientific issues inspired by rotorcraft technology needs and having the potential for making significant contributions towards Navy research thrusts and DoD goals and missions. Technology transfer and the partnering of this research with the US rotorcraft industry, U.S. Navy, other Government organizations (e.g., U.S. Army, NASA, FAA) and other academic institutions are encouraged.

The proposed research should emphasize innovative, creative basic research rather than application of existing technologies. Projects should not be directed at specific aircraft or systems, and need not offer immediate or specifically identifiable improvements in rotorcraft technology. Projects that merely apply engineering methods to develop or evaluate unusual vehicle configurations or components are not of interest under this Announcement. Although software development per se is not a goal of this announcement, projects demonstrating new methods via their software implementation will be considered.

The purpose of this Modification/Amendment is to attach Amendment 0002.

<DESC>The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity ActA Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) and The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) stipulates that the Secretary of Transportation must make a number of determinations before a grant or loan can be made for the construction of any project seeking Section 5309 New Starts funds.  These determinations require that the planning process generate credible information on project costs, ridership, financing, and environmental impacts.   49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 Section 5309 contains criteria for determining whether New Start projects are eligible for funding.  The Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Office of Planning and Environment (TPE) assesses New Starts projects to verify that requirements for eligibility for New Starts funding have been met.  

Reviews of past New Starts projects have documented that ridership forecasts have frequently varied significantly from ridership experienced after those projects have been opened for service.  In addition, increasing numbers of project sponsors are seeking New Starts funding, yet cannot demonstrate that adequate planning information has been produced during alternatives analysis.  To support development of accurate information on New Starts projects seeking New Starts funding, the Office of Planning and Environment provides guidance, technical assistance and oversight of the planning and project development process.  The results of this procurement will help ensure that alternatives analyses produce reliable information that can support the identification of projects that merit federal investment.

The purpose of this procurement is to obtain contractor support services for providing technical assistance to FTA, TPE.  FTA anticipates that the required services will focus on the following functional/task areas:

1  Collection of data on transit ridership patterns 
2  Urban travel models
3  Forecasting for New Starts and Small Starts projects
4  Refinement of methods for FTA oversight of New/Small Starts travel forecasts
