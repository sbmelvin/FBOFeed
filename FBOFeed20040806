<CONTACT>Lorrie Gleghorn Contracting Officer 5032312392     LORRIE_GLEGHORN@FWS.GOV;
<DESC>Notice of Intent to set aside as a sole source project: Award to  Dr. Bainbridge  of Berkeley, CA. Population Enhancement of Santa Cruz Tarplant, The goal of this project is to establish 2 subpopulations of Santa Cruz tarplant (Holocarpha macradenia) in suitable habitat directly adjacent to the existing population, including a soil seed bank, at Twin Lakes State Park (Santa Cruz County, California).  The current population is small (<20 individuals), and adjacent to a dirt road such that some seeds disperse into the road and do not contribute to recruitment.  In addition, the density of the seed bank is less than other populations, and small enough to put this population at risk.  This species has specific germination requirements, and at most sites requires management of non-native species to maintain annual recruitment.  The seeds produced from ray flowers of this species form a soil seed bank that contributes the long-term population persistence of this species.  A seed bank buffers the population against extirpation if management does not occur regularly, and it maintains genetic diversity of the population. This project will use outplanting of greenhouse-grown seedlings, and experimental recruitment in the field from outplanted seed using prepared sites.  Seed material exists from field collect of seed from previous outplantings (<10%), and multi-cohort greenhouse grown plants that have been carefully crossed to maximize genetic diversity of seed available for recovery efforts.  This project will test the efficiency and demographic consequences of establishment from seedlings versus seeds and may be applied to other areas where recovery tasks are being implemented.  Year  I:  In 2004-2005 another cohort of seeds and seedlings will be outplanted. ( In order to increase survivorship, plantings will be hand weeded and snails will be controlled by appropriate methods.  Survivorship and reproductive output of outplantings will be monitored.  In addition, a management treatment(s) (fire, biomass removal or scarification) will be implemented in 2004 that will trigger germination from the soil seed bank established from a previous years planting, to increase the soil seed bank, and the soil seed bank density will be estimated to determine overall success of the project. Germination and survivorship will be monitored. Demographic and other parameters (e.g,  germination, seedling survival, pollinator visitation, and reproductive output) of the resulting population will be compared to larger populations. Year 2:  In 2005-2006, another cohort will be outplanted, and an area of a previous years outplanting will be managed to trigger germination as described for year I.  Target Species: Santa Cruz tarplant (Holocarpha macradenia); listed federally threatened in 2000. Recovery Plan: There is no recovery plan for this species. However, because Santa Cruz tarplant has been a State-listed endangered plant since 1979, we have participated in interagency recovery workshops for the tarplant and have recently designated critical habitat, we have already formulated our concepts for recovery actions.  Enhancing habitat and expanding populations on the few locations that are publicly owned is a high priority  Cooperators:  Susan Bainbridge, Jepson Herbarium, 1001 VLSB #2465, University of California, Berkeley, CA  94720 (510/643-7008); and George Grey, Tim Hyland, California Department of Parks and Recreation (831-464-9141).

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement to begin renovation of selected existing administrative spaces at the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility, Philadelphia International Airport, Philadelphia, PA.  Specific work activities include the replacement of carpet floor tiles, vinyl floor tile, suspended ceiling tiles, bathroom fixtures and accessories, break room cabinetry and appliances, painting and various door and hardware replacements.  Minor mechanical, electrical and plumbing work are to be anticipated.

Ceiling tile, vinyl floor tile, carpet tile and associated mastic were found not to contain asbestos.  Although the existing vinyl floor tile and mastic is not to be removed, there is a concern that a few floor tiles may be pulled up when the carpet is removed.  To minimize any potential disruption, a licensed asbestos abatement contractor will be used.  Engineering controls and work practices as well as area air monitoring will be performed. The estimated price range for construction is between $150,000 and $200,000. The primary NAICS code associated with the project is 28390.

Additionally, contractors who are not certified thru the SBA as SEDB (8A) or who are not certified as Service Disabled and within the 100-mile radius will not be considered.

I.  Funding Opportunity Description 

1.	INTRODUCTION
The DARPA Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA to perform research, development, and testing to support the Advanced Soldier Sensor Information System and Technology (ASSIST) program.  The main goal of the program is to enhance battlefield awareness via exploitation of information collected by soldier-worn sensors.  The program will demonstrate an integrated system and advanced technologies for digitizing, processing and reporting key observational and experiential data captured by warfighters. 

1.1	PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
The U.S. military has developed extensive standardized reporting mechanisms to support information collection and communications. Warfighters are called upon to report in a timely and accurate manner key observations and experiences during ground missions. Such information sharing is essential for improving situational understanding and overall operational effectiveness especially in today's urban combat environments.  The confusion of the battlefield combined with the physical and psychological stresses on the warfighters can make this task very difficult.  Furthermore, today's verbal and text-based reports limit the extent of information that is conveyed and critical information is lost. 

The objective of the program is to exploit soldier-worn sensors to augment the soldier's recall and reporting capability to enhance situational understanding.  The effort will develop information processing and representation tools to maximize the utility of data collected by the multi-modal sensors.

1.2 	PROGRAM SCOPE AND FUNDING
The program is composed of two consecutive phases.  This BAA solicits proposals for the 12-month Phase I effort, which will focus on baseline system development (Task 1) and advanced technology research (Task 2).  Phase II will focus on systems integration and evaluation of advanced capabilities.  Proposals for Phase II will be solicited separately in a future BAA.  

In Phase I, the program expects to award 4-8 contracts.  Awards are expected not to exceed $4.0 M per each effort.  However, the Government reserves the right to adjust the total program funding and the number of awards to meet the best interests of the program.  Phase I is divided into two major task areas.  A single abstract/proposal should address a single task area.  Therefore two separate abstracts/proposals should be submitted if a team or collaborating teams are interested in tackling both tasks.  Each project team should include an appropriate mix of expertise in order to develop an end-to-end, integrated technical solution for the selected task area.  Projects that address only one or a subset of technical challenges within a task area are not likely to be funded.  A proposal may also include optional tasks that may last up to 6 months.

In general, proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed below and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that contributes substantially towards the goals stated.

2.	TECHNICAL APPROACH
Phase I of the program will demonstrate new capabilities that exploit information captured via soldier-worn sensors. Input streams from sensors detecting location, images, audio, and motion will be logged and processed to create digital reports and representations.
Each proposal should describe a comprehensive technical approach that addresses one of the following two task areas: 
Task 1:  Baseline System Development – This task stresses active information capture and voice annotations exploitation.  The resulting products from Task 1 will be prototype wearable capture units and the supporting operational software for processing, logging and retrieval.
Task 2:  Advanced Technology Research – This task stresses passive collection and automated activity/object recognition.  The results from this task will be the algorithms, software, and tools that will undergo system integration in Phase II.

2.1 TASK 1: BASELINE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT 
The Task 1 objective is to demonstrate and evaluate a field-deployable capture system together with the associated processing/retrieval/visualization system to support information collection and use by dismounted warfighters.  During the Phase I effort, performers will be required to demonstrate the wearable capture system, develop the retrieval system, and participate in field tests where the integrated capture/retrieval system will be evaluated. Proposals must provide a complete solution for Phase I.

The baseline operational concept involves a dismounted soldier on a patrol or a scout mission, capturing still images of potential value that he annotates with a few spoken words or sentences.  The captured data is locally stored together with the time/location information.  On returning from the patrol, the soldier edits and logs the data for processing. The system extracts appropriate metadata and distills the collected information into multimedia representations and digital report(s) that may support later patrols and mission planning. The soldier may also have the capability to capture his observations or situation using a video recorder.  For example, a short video segment and metadata may be retrieved and transmitted, prompted by soldier command (e.g. "send the last 10 seconds") when an enemy contact situation is encountered.

2.2 TASK2: ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH
The Task 2 objective is to develop advanced technologies that will ultimately enable fully automated organization of soldier-worn sensor data.  The project will research the use of different sensor modalities including sensors that could activate other sensors based on voluntary or involuntary physiological queues, and soldier-worn video cameras for continuous or semi-continuous data capture. Advanced processing will enable automated identification and extraction of key information content from the multiple raw input streams.  This task area will address the deficiencies identified by the baseline system, and create enabling technologies that will be incorporated into the system during Phase II.  

DARPA seeks development of key technological components that enable sensor data capture, processing, retrieval and analysis including the following:  
•	Capture of multiple sensor data streams (e.g. video, motion, location, audio including interface to military radio communication modes); advanced sensor trigger techniques; selective on-wearer storage in appropriate formats and resolutions; data protection; on-wearer user interfaces (preferably hands-free, spoken language interface) for sensor control, data entry, and data access. 
•	Interpretation of raw data through vision processing, linguistic interpretation, and motion/location extraction; automatic recognition and classification of objects, scenes, and activities through exploitation of multiple sensory inputs and use of contextual inferences. 
•	Metadata extraction and association; identification of events and states; creation of higher order representations of activities, scenes and patterns; segmentation of recorded data; multimedia database technology.
•	Development of general ontology and knowledge representations for objects, events and activities; development of mission or task-specific representations; learning tools and infrastructure to support the ongoing co-development of ontological data structures and the perception/interpretation/inference components.    Existing DoD taxonomies for visual information and military report data fields should be considered for integration into higher-level military information infrastructure.
•	User interfaces for offline editing; interfaces for metadata-keyed browsing, video/audio playback, and data querying; visualization of data content including displays of physical and logical relationships; information correlation and analysis tools. Development of interfaces for both laptop-based systems and soldier-worn systems are sought.

These capabilities and functions should be addressed within the context of the overall system architecture. The program also emphasizes the system's ability to learn from experiences so that performance improves as it accumulates knowledge and experience.  The proposal should describe the system's learning process including the interfaces and tools for users to teach, tune, reinforce, and to correct the system.  Several examples should be developed that illustrate the mechanics of the system expanding its sensor-derived knowledge base, learning new object/event classes, and improving its classification accuracy.  The system should also support an embedded explanation capability allowing the user to learn why the system reasoned or behaved as it did.

Leveraging of existing hardware and software is highly encouraged.  Commercially available sensors and communication resources should be selected to serve as surrogates for the equipment of the future dismounted warfighter, consistent with those being considered for the U.S. Army’s Future Force Warrior  and the Special Operations SOF Warrior concepts (See http://www.natick.army.mil/soldier/wsit/ and http://soal.socom.mil/documents/SOAE_APBI_Presentation_13May04.pdf).  The development of hardware such as wearable computing platforms, sensors, localization infrastructure, and communications modules is not the focus of the program. However, the selection rationale for these elements, including critical specifications and estimated costs, should be presented in detail in the proposal.  In particular, the data storage components to be employed and an estimate of the range of volume of data of each type expected to be stored per unit time should be included in the system analysis.


II. Award Information 
The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Final funding determination will be based on the combination of proposed approaches which will reasonably support program success. Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.

<CONTACT>Phyliss Schlegel, 609 485-4380
<DESC>Description of Requirement:  The Federal Aviation Administrationâ€™s (FAA) Tower Integration Group wishes to standardize a clear, precise siting process that utilizes emerging automation technologiesâ€”an Airport Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCT) process that can be easily used by any airport and meet FAA standards. The ATCT siting process will incorporate and further develop the Three-Dimensional Airspace Analysis Programs (3DAAP) as the integral data standard and analytical tool.  The Hillsborough County Aviation Authority (HCAA) in cooperation with the State of Florida and the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, will champion a prototype project to identify and provide critical guidance to Florida Airports on the total process of planning, siting and coordinating new ATCT and navigational aid facilities.  HCAA is currently in the process of siting a new ATCT at TPA, which will serve as the Project Site for this contract.  If the prototype resulting from the TPA study proves successful, LTP data collection and operational capabilities will be greatly expanded. Requirements:  The following tasks are required for this contract: Â·	Establish a Technical User Group, create a Project Web Site, Project Design Document and delineate Process Requirements. Â·	Identify and Collect Required Data using Three-Dimensional (3D) stereoscopic geo-coded imagery and Epi-polar corrected color stereo imagery of the project area; create JPEG/ECW imagery files; provide AeroGIS software license on a Shuttle PC, along with two pairs of stereo glasses and emitter; AutoCAD planimetric data as per 3DAAP standards. Â·	ATCT  Alternatives Siting Analysis Process and Documentation to include updated 3D Airspace wireframes of TPA and of all buildings located at TPA; Updated NAVAID drawings of TPA; Modified CADD files for future TPA development; Typical criteria data and analysis required for the standard siting process; Upgraded 3DAAP Program; Specific TPA analysis results; Confirmation of TPA ATCT sites; & document general ATCT analysis requirements.  Â·	Training â€“ classes in AeroGis and instruction on the entire ATCT Siting Process, training DVDs and training data. Required standards and technologies:  Technical standards that must be met include:  The Florida Department of Transportationâ€™s  (FDOT) data collection standards, especially in the area of the 3DAAP programs and three-dimensional Airport Layout Plans (ALP).  These digital data standards shall apply to this project.   The State of Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) has mandated the 3DAAP data standard for all airport construction projects in the state.  The contract requires the use of AeroGis data collection tool; Computer Aided Design and Drafting (CADD) deliverables; and Digital photogrammetry; Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) compliant metadata record. Planning Technology, Incâ€™s (PTI) of Clearwater, Florida has, for over fifteen years, identified, developed, applied and supported specific, unique and proprietary computer applications related to aviation.  Software, which PTI has developed and maintains, that is needed for this work includes Three Dimensional Airspace Analysis Program (3DAAP) and the ATC 83A Terminal Procedures Obstruction Evaluation Program (TERPS). The FDOT has consistently recognized PTI as the sole source provider for modifications to the 3DAAP Program and for modification of the associated state mandated, data standards.  PTI is the only source with the requisite, updated programs that possess the design capabilities and functionality required for this work  A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of requisite capabilities, equipment and experience in providing similar research service for FAA to evaluate.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Knowledge Networks for data collection to support an economic analysis of offshore marine protected areas in the Northeastern United States.  An absolute requirement of this research is that the sample of the general public who is chosen to receive the questionnaires is selected using statistically valid stratified random sampling techniques.  Equally important, the response rate (i.e. the percentage of the sample who responds completely) must be high in order to preserve the properties of the stratified random sample.  These statistical requirements are necessary to ensure that the data collected by the survey are truly representative of the general public and, therefore, can legitimately be used to assess the economic value (benefits) of marine protected areas (MPAs) through federally mandated regulatory impact analyses.  Knowledge Networks is the only known company who provides a scientific probability sample of US households in a research panel that uses computer-based methods.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by August 20, 2004.    Written requests for additional information may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>Computer simulation, operation and scenario generation and modeling technical support services are sought for the Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC), formerly known as the Theater Aerospace Command and Control Simulation Facility (TACCSF).  Organizations having capabilities in the areas of military operational expertise in the weapons systems identified below, computer simulation requirements definition, exercise and test planning and implementation in a simulated environment, and scenario generation for large scale distributed simulations are invited to submit their qualifications for consideration.  The DMOC, located at Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB), New Mexico, has live, constructive and virtual operator-in-the-loop simulators which are used to replicate the all C2ISR elements in the vertical chain from decision maker to shooter for training, CONOPS development, mission rehearsal, RDT&E and studies and analysis,. DMOC currently includes (in alphabetical order):  Airborne Laser Simulator (ABL), Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI), Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS),  Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS), AN/TQY-23 Operations Module, Airspace Control and Operations Training (ASCOT), ASTi Enhanced Dialogue Digital Audio Comm System, Airborne Warning and Control System Simulator (legacy)(AWACS), Airborne Warning and Control System Simulator (Plexsys MTC)(AWACS), Common Connectivity Device (CCD), Cobra Ball Simulator, Distributed Information Warfare Constructive Environment (DICE), Data Collection/Posttest Subsystem, Data Link Simulator, Data Loggers, Distributed Interactive Simulation Filter, Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSim), Extended Air Defense Battlespace (EADTB), F-15C/E Weapons and Tactics Trainer (WTT), F-16 Desktop Simulator, High-Level Architecture (HLA) Gateway, Improved Multi-Link Translator and Display System (IMTDS), Joint Surveillance, Tracking and Reconnaissance System (JSTARS) Simulator, Joint STARS Work Station, Joint Tactical and Conflict Tactical Simulator (JCATS), Link-16/Gateway Terminal Emulator, Mapper, Master Simulation (MSIM), META VR Stealth Viewer, Missile Defense System Exerciser Remote Environment, Missile Tracker / Correlator System, Modular Control Equipment Simulator, Master Simulation Gateway, Next Generation Threat System (NGTS), Portable Flight Planning Software, REDSIM (DIS Logger), Scenario Generation System (SGS),  Scenario Toolkit and Generation Environment (STAGE) , Simulation Cell (White Force), Space Simulation, Tactical Information Broadcast System(TIBS) Terminal Simulator, Theater Battle Management Corps System (TBMCS),.  

b.  The battlespace is designed with an open architecture to facilitate connection of these nodes to emulate a variety of Theater Air Defense (TAD) systems, and architecture for various theaters.  The battlespace is capable of simulating up to 10,000 simultaneous air and ground objects.  The largest current scenario is 60 geocells (60x60 nautical miles each). Digital data bases (DTED,DFAD, and imagery)are used for terrain. The effects of electronic countermeasures (ECM) and atmospheric phenomenon are also modeled.  

c.  The DMOC is linked to many military simulation facilities through T-1 lines and ATM clouds.  DIS and HLA gateways and corresponding network components allow the DMOC to interface with a variety of joint, live, virtual, and constructive simulations.  Translators are available to allow exchange of tactical data link messages between actual field equipment and simulation models.  DMOC is also developing the capability to process live range data.  

d. The technical support will consist of operator and white force (Operators for the constructive simulations required to add realism and density to exercises and tests), support for tests and exercises, technical and analytical performance in support of the operation of the battlespace, technical and program management support, data collection, data reduction and analysis, test planning and reporting, requirements definition, currency analysis, system engineering, system software Quality Assurance/Configuration Control (QA/QC) and Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A) tasks.  The contractor must be able to support surge requirements with appropriately skilled and cleared personnel, sometimes with little notice to support training and tests.   Major deliverables will include test schedules, plans, scenarios, after action reports, technical reports, system analysis, engineering analysis reports, engineering drawings and schematics.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Procurement Of 6 H-53D Troop Seats with minor modifications with options Static Test Plan, and procurement of 200 OPEVAL seats

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Patuxent River, MD proposes to procure six (6) H-53D troop seats with minor modifications and engineering and technical support to test and analyze of the suitability of the modified seats for incorporation into the V-22 configuration baseline.  There are two contemplated options.  The first option is to develop a static test plan, perform a static test plan, and post test analysis.  Testing shall be performed at contractor’s Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) facilities and all resulting data, test results and analyses provided to NAVAIR for review.  The second option, if exercised after the results of option one pass NAVAIR’s engineering evaluation and qualification board, is for the purchase of 200 modified H-53D troop seats for use in OPEVAL testing/demonstration.   
	A firm-fixed price contract is being contemplated.  This action will be negotiated on a sole source basis with Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) under the statutory authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements) as this seat embodies a proprietary design exclusive to IAI.  Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) is the sole designer, developer and producer of the existing V-22 troop seat.  IAI is also the sole designer, developer and producer of the H-53D seat which is a follow-on derivative of the V-22 troop seat design that corrected some, but not all, issues documented during V-22 troop seat testing.  As the H-53D troop seat has already been developed and flight test qualified, incorporation into the V-22 baseline will not require extensive analysis and retest of the dynamic and static airframe analysis.  In addition, as a derivative design of the V-22 troop seat, the H-53D troop seat hinge/mounting interfaces are compatible with the existing V-22 airframe structure thereby eliminating the need for cost prohibitive airframe structural modifications.   IAI will make minor modifications to the H-53D troop seat to address V-22 specific deficiencies.  The approximate issue date is 24 August 2004.  This is for information only.  No phone inquires will be entertained; written or facsimile responses only.  See Numbered Note(s): 22 and 26.

EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (FAR 52.212-2)  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   EVALUATION FACTORS        Factor 1 – Past Performance     Factor 2 – Price Factor 1 and factor 2 are equally important.      Factor 1 – PAST PERFORMANCE   During the source selection process, the Government will assess the offeror's past performance in the evaluation for contract award.  Accordingly, each offeror is required to submit a list of up to five of its most recent contracts within the past three years, either completed or on-going, for the same/similar products or services. It is preferred that these contracts be with U.S. Government customers, but contracts with other commercial concerns are also acceptable.  Offerors are authorized to provide information relative to any problems encountered on the identified contracts and any corrective actions taken by the offeror.  The Source Selection Authority (SSA)/Contracting Officer will evaluate the offeror's past performance based upon the information furnished by the offeror and/or other information obtained by the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or securing any information not furnished with the offer.  The SSA/Contracting Officer may, however, utilize all available information, including information not provided by the offeror, in the past performance evaluation.  The Government reserves the right to review less than all information submitted, and to only analyze sufficient information to make a reasonable determination of each offeror’s past performance rating. Past performance is assessed by the SSA/Contracting Officer and is assigned a narrative rating in the evaluation.  Each offeror will be given an adjectival rating on past performance: highly favorable, favorable, neither favorable nor unfavorable, unfavorable, highly unfavorable, or no same or similar history.  Offerors who do not have same or similar past performance information reasonably available to the Contracting Officer will not be rated either favorable or unfavorable.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offer as set forth elsewhere in the solicitation.  In addition, the Government may accept other than the lowest priced offer if doing so would result in greater value to the Government in terms of technical performance, quality, reliability, life cycle cost, or lower overall program risk.   As a part of the past performance evaluation, the Government will assess the offeror's previous compliance with the requirements of FAR 52.! 219-8 and 52.219-9 as applicable.  Factor 2  – PRICE EVALUATION  Price will not be rated but will be considered in determining the “best value” to the Government.  The best value determination may result in the Government being willing to pay a premium for higher technical capability.  The price becomes more important as the degree of equality increases between offers.   The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror or to the offeror with the highest adjectival technical score if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the greatest value to the Government.  52.212-4 TAILORING -- The following paragraphs are hereby added to the clause:     (o)  Warranty. The contractor shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the Government.  Acceptance of the standard commercial warranty does not waive the Government's rights under the "Inspection" clause nor does it limit the Government's rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract.

The standard commercial warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable material and/or services listed in the Schedule.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) China Lake, CA intends to issue a modification to increase the level of effort for Option Years, One, Two, Three and Four on Contract Number N68936-01-D-0036, using other than full and open competition. This additional level of effort is required due to increased workload since the initial Government estimates were developed.  The increased effort must be sole sourced to Systems Application & Technologies, Inc., the contractor currently providing range test support under the subject contract.  The work anticipated under the increase is identical to the labor categories and labor mix currently under contract; thereby making it impossible to separate out the work and competitively award the increased level of effort. The Government intends to increase the number of estimated labor hours for Option Year One by 60,929 hours, Option Year Two by 92,430 hours, Option Year Three by 92,430 hours and Option Year Four by 92,4! 30 hours, for a total increase of 338,219 labor hours for all four option years.  Any firms believing that they can provide the services without impacting Range test scheduling may submit their qualifications and any other information considered pertinent to the requirement to the Contract Specialist within 45 days after publication of synopsis.  The work under the subject contract was set-aside for 8(a) firms.  See Notes 22 and 26.   Place of Performance = NAWCWD China Lake, CA and Point Mugu, CA Set Aside = N/A NAICS Code = 541330

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to extend Contract No. S43978G, entitled "Information Technology Research and Development," for the Applied Engineering and Technology Directorate with SAIC, Inc., on a sole source basis. This extension will be for a 6-month period through March 31, 2005. This extension will allow the work to continue until the award of the competitive follow-on procurement. The follow-on procurement is expected to be in place by April 1, 2005. SAIC, Inc. is uniquely qualified to perform this requirement, due to their extensive work in the U.S. Intelligence world, which has been applied to NASA for performing long range Systems Engineering technology planning. If SAIC is not allowed to continue their service, during this 6-month extension, interrupting the ongoing research work will cause delays and missed milestones. There would also be major delays in getting a new contractor's staff up to speed, and there would be a loss in time for a new contractor to develop its own new methods to apply to ongoing tasks. The statutory authority for Other than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item, using FAR Part 12. See Note 22. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
This is a pre-solicitation notice for the NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) Program.   Upon execution of an updated agreement between NSRP and the Navy, the NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) Program will issue a formal Research Announcement on the research effort described below. The NSRP ASE program goal is to reduce the cost of building and maintaining U.S. Navy warships. To accomplish this, NSRP ASE is focused on industry-wide implementation of solutions to common cost drivers – solutions to consensus priority issues that exhibit a compelling business case to improve the efficiency of the U.S. Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Industry. Solutions include both leverage of best commercial practices and creation of industry-specific initiatives. Aggressive technology transfer to, and buy-in by, multiple U.S. shipyards is a requirement of all funded efforts. Successful projects are those that clearly reduce total ownership costs, benefits that can be delivered by varied combinations of cost reductions in acquisition and fleet life-cycle costs. Identification of specific cost reduction manifestation is an important element of NSRP program.  The complete Research Announcement (RA) will be posted at www.nsrp.org. This announcement is issued as a pre-solicitation notice to potential proposers.  The formal Research Announcement will solicit proposals for research, development and implementation of best practices across the following major initiative areas in U.S. shipyards: Shipyard Production Process Technologies; Business Process Technologies; Product Design and Material Technologies; Systems Technologies; Facilities and Tooling; and Crosscut Initiatives. These major initiatives are described in detail in the Strategic Investment Plan (SIP) located on the Web at www.nsrp.org. Offerors are strongly advised to read the SIP in order to gain a greater understanding of the sub-initiative areas detailed below. Because the program major initiatives are closely tied to each other, proposals may be submitted with a scope that represents integrated efforts across several major initiative and/or sub-initiative areas.  The Research Announcement will be modified as necessary to reflect changes in industry and/or government priorities.

Teaming
Teaming arrangements are encouraged. At least one U.S. shipyard should be substantially involved in each project, normally in a leadership role. Exceptions to this may be considered on a case-by-case basis where there is compelling justification that the program mission is best served by the proposed deviation. 

Awards
Due to limited funding, the NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to limit awards under any topic, and only proposals considered to be of superior quality will be funded. The NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received. 

Awards will be made using a Technology Investment Agreement. These assistance instruments are not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). A copy of the NSRP ASE Program Technology Investment Agreement will be available on the NSRP Web site (www.nsrp.org) under R&D Programs. 

For those proposals that are approved for award by the Executive Control Board (ECB), a letter contract will be executed immediately after the selection meeting.  This letter contract is expected to be for a period of 30 days with sufficient funding to conduct project kickoff activities.  All proposers, unless exceptions are authorized by the ECB for unusual circumstances (e.g., significant changes to the SOW directed by NSRP), will be expected to sign the final agreement within 30 days of selection. The amount of funding available will be dependent upon receipt of Government Fiscal Year 2005 funds.  The NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to terminate awards if the offeror is not able to conclude a formal, signed Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) within 30  calendar days of selection notification.  

Proposal Preparation and Submittal
Offerors should obtain a copy of the latest NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise Proposal Preparation Kit (version 4.4 will be available on the NSRP Web site at www.nsrp.org).  This guide is specifically designed to assist offerors in understanding the RA proposal process.  The proposal format provided in the PPK is mandatory.  A link for submitting questions regarding the proposal process will be provided at www.nsrp.org.  All questions received and corresponding answers will be posted to this site (publicly accessible).  In addition, the NSRP ASE Program is anticipating to host a proposer’s conference at the Advanced Technology Institute, North Charleston, SC, to provide an overview of the program, explain the process, and answer general questions.  Once a firm date has been scheduled, additional information will be available by sending an email to nsrp@aticorp.org .

Abstracts for the formal Research Announcement will be optional, but if submitted must be in the format described in Attachment 4 of the PPK.  Abstracts for this solicitation are anticipated to be due no later than 3:00 PM Eastern time on August 25, 2004. Feedback on the abstracts will be provided to submitters approximately two weeks after receipt.  

Full Proposals (hard copy, plus electronic versions of both the Technical Proposal and the Cost Proposal) in response to the formal Research Announcement (RA) are anticipated to be required by October 5, 2004, 12:00 PM (noon) Eastern Time.  Proposals received after the time and date specified in the formal Research Announcement will be returned to the proposer and will not be evaluated. Acknowledgement of receipt of proposals will be made after the due date.

REQUIREMENTS

Technical Description
A formal Research Announcement is expected to be issued to solicit proposals for research, development and implementation of best practices in U.S. shipyards as described in detail in the Strategic Investment Plan (SIP). A synopsis of the six major initiative areas follows.
	
	SHIPYARD PRODUCTION PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES
Shipyard Production Process Technologies addresses all production processes used to transform raw material, services, components, equipment, and interim products into completed products. Specifically, these processes include steel, aluminum and composites fabrication, sub-assembly, assembly and erection, outfit fabrication, installation and test, surface preparation and coating, joining, process control (accuracy control and process management), and services (transportation and rigging).

BUSINESS PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES  
Business Process Technologies encompass all business processes from initial business strategy development to post-delivery customer service, required to rapidly and effectively respond to the marketplace.   
	
	PRODUCT DESIGN AND MATERIAL TECHNOLOGIES
Product Design and Material Technologies include the parametric design rules, metrics, design and material standards, design and analysis tools, and engineering data required to rapidly and efficiently design modern ships in response to market inquiries and to support the follow on contract design, detail design and production phases. This major initiative includes the identification and development of advanced product designs and materials to support development of the next generation of high performance ships.

	
	SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES
The overall application of information technologies to shipbuilding is categorized as Systems Technologies within the Strategic Investment Plan. The scope of systems technologies includes the underlying information systems infrastructure required to support the other initiatives with emphasis on the tools, environment, and integration required to reduce product realization lead time and provide for tighter coupling between enterprise functions. For the purpose of this initiative, the scope of Systems Technologies can be characterized as an “Integrated Shipbuilding Environment” (ISE).  By integrated, it is meant that the various business processes and their supporting information technology systems are able to accept and disseminate information electronically without manual intervention, passing paper, or off-line translations or reformatting. Information is entered once and reused throughout the ship lifecycle.

	
	FACILITIES AND TOOLING
Facilities and tooling includes the functions of providing and maintaining a physical plant capable of assembling, modifying and repairing ships in an efficient, safe, controllable and ecologically acceptable manner. This Major Initiative focuses on asset management issues such as facility utilization, facility planning, maintenance, and capital investment strategies.  Additionally, included with this Major Initiative are several risk avoidance issues such as environmental, safety, health, and ergonomic practices within the shipyard.  
	
	CROSSCUT INITIATIVES
Crosscut initiatives encompass the key factors related to people and organizations that can impact the successful implementation of technology advancements and changes in the shipbuilding and repair industry. These factors integrate into all of the major initiatives identified in the NSRP ASE program.  The formal Research Announcement will seek both separate projects that focus on the crosscut factors in general, as well as proposed crosscut solutions developed as supporting elements of the other major ASE initiatives.  


SPECIFIC INTEREST AREAS

Lean Enterprise Concepts
While not a separate major initiative, of particular interest during this solicitation are initiatives directed toward furthering the U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair industry’s adoption of Lean enterprise practices.  

	Shipyards have begun to realize the benefits of applying Lean enterprise principles across the entire value stream from supplier to the final customer.  The principles include specifying value in terms of the customer's needs, identifying the value stream for each product or service, creating continuous flow through the value stream, producing goods or services according to customer demand, and continuing to always improve and seek perfection.  There is industry interest in follow-on efforts that will build on the implementation of basic Lean practices by introducing into shipbuilding and ship repair more advanced Lean concepts and the means of integrating Lean with Six Sigma and other process improvement and quality improvement programs.  

Nationwide Shipyard Integration/Interoperability Concepts
The Navy continues to ask NSRP to extend, develop and implement collaborative approaches that support nationwide shipyard integration/interoperability, including but not limited to Common Parts Catalog (CPC) type approaches.  The NSRP Strategic Investment Plan and the current Research Announcement are both structured to support these types of projects.  Because of this interest, an area of project concentration included in this solicitation is continuing efforts related to Common Part Catalog (CPC) Initiatives, which have developed common processes and procedures for part definition and configuration management across shipyards. This inter-shipyard collaborative concentration supports industry’s Strategic Investment Plan (SIP).  The CPC Project supports integrated design/manufacturing initiatives and provides the required data definition to support material control systems. Standardizing part data allows an organization to search and find parts more quickly and accurately, permits re-use of part data, facilitates the ability to share inventory among collaborating organizations, and results in fewer parts to procure, inspect and warehouse.  This standardization results in increased demand for standard parts, which allows suppliers to better serve industry and organizations to benefit from volume discounts.  Further, the U.S. Navy benefits by needing fewer parts to support ships on-station and through the greater availability of parts across surface ship and submarine inventories.  During the 2003 NSRP solicitation, projects were proposed and selected to complete the development and implementation of CPC capabilities at four 1st Tier yards, develop the capability for 2nd Tier yards, and conduct assessments at two other 1st Tier yards.  


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

Deliverable Items
The following deliverable data items shall be required: (a) Quarterly Technical Status Report; (b) Quarterly Business Status report (including participant provided funds); (c) Presentation Material, as required; (d) Contractor's Billing Voucher in accordance with milestone payment schedule; (e) Quarterly status report briefings; (f) Software Development Plan (if software development is proposed); (g) Technology Transfer Plan; (h) Project Management Plan; and, (i) Final Technical Report. Appropriate interaction with Ship Production Panels and industry workshops should also be considered.  Offerors are expected to also identify other deliverable items that are unique to their project. 

Security Requirements
Classified material is not expected to be used on this effort. 

Other Special Requirements
Proposers are advised that research findings and technology developments arising under this Agreement may constitute a significant enhancement to the national defense, and to the economic vitality of the United States.  As such, in the conduct of all work awarded under this agreement, the Recipient will comply strictly with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (22 CFR 120-130), the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M) and the Department of Commerce Export Regulation (15 CFR 730-774.).

Anticipated Period of Performance:  For the anticipated research announcement, projects must be 12 months or less in duration due to uncertainty of future years funding availability.

Expected Award Date
February 2005 for most, if not all, selected proposals.  

Funding Estimate: It is anticipated that approximately $6,700,000 over a 12-month period will be available for new NSRP ASE Program awards for this solicitation cycle based on expectations of congressional budget actions. There is no guarantee of this funding level or that awards will be made in any individual topic areas. Multiple awards may be made in a given area depending, in part, on the cost of individual proposals and available funding. Potential funding levels for future years are described in the NSRP ASE Strategic Investment Plan available on the Web site.  Some program funding may be used to support other methods of industry technology advancement, such as symposia and industry study groups.  Due to the relatively short period of performance for projects (i.e., no longer than 12 months), rapid project startup is expected.

Type of Funding Instrument
The contractual vehicle used to fund the awards will be a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA).   A copy of the TIA may be found on http://www.nsrp.org.  Proposals without an affirmative response to the cover page certification of agreement to abide by the terms and conditions of the Technology Investment Agreement  (current version will be available on the NSRP web site) will be subject to elimination during screening.  Proposers are advised to contact the NSRP Director of Contracts if they have any questions on this requirement. Proposers are advised that terms and conditions are currently being negotiated with NAVSEA for the future NSRP Joint Funding Agreement modification. These new terms and conditions might have an impact on some of the terms and conditions contained in the current TIA that the program has posted on the NSRP web site.  Proposers are advised to check the NSRP web site periodically during the proposal preparation period for any new changes to the TIA terms and conditions.

Program Furnished Property
None contemplated. 

Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the NSRP ASE Program Office point of contact cited below upon deciding to respond to the formal Research Announcement. Foreign contractors should be aware that prior Government approval may be required before their proposals can be considered.


Preparation Cost: The cost of preparing proposals in response to any formal Research Announcement is not considered a direct charge to any resulting award or any other contract. 

BASIS FOR AWARD

The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of an offeror's response (both technical and cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the announcement. Details of the evaluation criteria are provided in the Proposal Preparation Kit, and are summarized below:

Technical Aspects
The technical aspect, which is ranked as the first order of priority relative to the other factors (cost share, proprietary content, and cost aspect), shall be evaluated based on the following criteria:  

1.	Strategic fit and leverage
2.	Business case
3.	Innovation and technical merit
4.	Technology transfer and industry implementation
5.	Team strength and management plan

The first is the most important technical factor. Proposals that do not meet the strategic fit and leverage criteria will not be recommended for award.  The other four technical factors are of equal importance to each other.  Each is defined in greater detail in the Proposal Preparation Kit.

Other Factors
a.	Cost share: The proposal shall demonstrate a commitment to share the cost and risk of the proposed effort. The NSRP ASE program goal is 50% cost share (i.e., for every dollar of program funding provided, industry will provide at least one (1) dollar in cost share). While there is no pre-determined cost share ratio requirement for any single project, the following incentives apply: (1) Shipyard-specific proposals are expected to provide significantly higher cost share than collaborative projects, and (2) All projects will compete on, among other factors, the degree to which the proposers will share the cost and thus leverage program funds.  Additional information regarding allowable types of cost share can be found in the NSRP ASE Proposal Preparation Kit.
b.	Shipyard Specific Projects
Most of the program funding will be applied toward open, collaborative projects that are widely acceptable with broad applicability.  For this reason, most projects will be recommended for award on the basis of sharing results within the U.S. industry. It is anticipated that some projects with limited access, and limited or delayed applicability to the broad industry will be awarded, but these projects will require substantially higher cost share. The estimated fraction of a proposed project's funding that will be used in developing technologies that will be openly shared without delay, such that a higher percentage of the results are shared, will be considered in the evaluation.  Proposals with a higher degree of results that are openly shared and readily transferable throughout the industry will be viewed more favorably.

Cost Aspects: Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) plans to enter into a sole source contract with the University of Utah, 201 S. President's Circle, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 to analyze average telomere length using a high-throughput quantitative PCR technique in 2100 samples in duplicate for a total of 4200 analysis.  The acquisition is being conducted based on FAR 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $10.M.  The OEEB objective is to analyze average telomere length using a high-throughput quantitative PCR technique using only minimal amounts of DNA in 2100 samples in duplicate for a total of 4200 analysis from several different studies including the NCI-SEER NHL study (n=350), Spanish bladder study (n=350), Xuan Wei (n=550), benzene (n=450), corn farming (n=200) and rubber (n=150).  Normal somatic cells have a limited capacity to proliferate and a finite number of divisions.  The end of chromosomes in all eukaryotic cells are capped by telomeres, which consist of tandem repeats TTAGGG.  The overall length in human cells is 5-15kb.  Telomeres are considered a molecular clock marker and they prevent the chromosome ends from being recognized as free DNA double stranded breaks.  Recent studies have demonstrated associations between telomere length and various cancers among which carcinomas of the head and neck, kidney, bladder, lung and NHL.  Association has been found between mean telomere length due to exposure to antineoplastic drugs suggesting that telomere length might be influenced by certain genotoxic exposures.  Recently a valid and reliable PCR method has been developed that has a high throughput and requires only small amounts of DNA.  This development has opened the way to evaluate the possible relation between telomere length and future cancer risk and its possible relation with genotoxic exposures in several NCI studies to confirm the previous observations and to explore in more detail the relations between exposure, telomere shortening and future cancer risk.  The University of Utah is the only source known to the NCI that has an operating telomere assay that is capable of measuring average telomere length in DNA using very limited amounts of DNA and with high-throughput to analyze the needed number of samples within a relatively short time period.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT (local Washington, DC time) on August 23, 2004. If you have any questions please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on 301-402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considred solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please reference RFQ-NCI-40127-NQ on any and all correspondance.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   	The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in Cincinnati, OH, with Dr. Rao Govindraju of Purdue University for a study on Watershed-Scale Evaluation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) and their role in Total Maximum Daily Loading (TMDL) development with respect to sediments and nutrients in the Black Creek watershed in Indiana. Specifically, Dr. Govindraju shall integrate BMPs with a calibrated Solid and Assessment (SWAT) model and develop a cost-effective selection and evaluation of the  BMPs in the Black Creek watershed. This objective will be achieved through: 1) representation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) in SWAT model; 2) conducting uncertainty analysis to define TMDLs margin of safety; and 3) development of an optimization model to identify and evaluate the most  cost-effective combination of BMPs to alleviate sediment and nutrients in the watershed.  This notice is not a request for quotations. EPA market research indicates that Dr. Rao Govindraju of Purdue University is the only known contractor with the appropriate level of technical knowledge necessary  to complete this project. Dr. Govindaraju has spent over a year's time and effort in collecting and assimilating the data for BMPs to be used for modeling studies. In an independent study, Dr. Govindaraju has developed, calibrated, and verified a SWAT model for the Black Creek watershed. Further,  the period spent by Dr. Govindaraju to develop the BMPs modeling platform gained unique insights into methods to apply and improve BMPs modeling capabilities. These qualifications make Dr. Govindaraju uniquely qualified to perform the requirements of this project in a time-efficient and cost  effective manner. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such a project. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before Monday  August  23, 2004 at 10:00 AM EST).  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   	The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in Research Triangle Park, NC with Dr. Wayne Robarge of North Carolina State University for a study entitled "Determination of Atmospheric Ammonia Concentrations in Agricultural Regions Using Passive Filter Technology." The purpose of this project is to quantify the operational characteristics of passive collectors for the routine determination of ambient ammonia concentrations, using annular denuders as a standard ammonia measurement  technique, and to initiate a multi-site ammonia network in eastern North Carolina using passive measurement technology. Dr. Robarge shall: 1) analyze annular denuder samples for ambient ammonia, ammonium aerosol, hydrochloric acid, chloride aerosol, nitric acid, nitrate aerosol, nitrous acid,  sulfur dioxide, sulfate aerosol, collected at 4 sites in eastern North Carolina, and 2) analyze passive samples for ambient ammonia also collected at these sites. It is anticipated that this study will require analysis of about 17,714 samples including anions and cations.  This notice is not a  request for quotations. Due to the fact that shipping samples out of state could require excessive shipping charges and cause skewed results if samples are not quickly tested, the nature of this acquisition requires the contractor to be in the near proximity to eastern North Carolina in order to  quickly retrieve and test the samples. EPA market research indicates that Dr. Wayne Robarge of North Carolina State University is the only known local contractor with the appropriate level of technical knowledge and laboratory equipment necessary to complete this project. Specifically, the NCSU  laboratory contains equipment designed specifically for analysis of annular denuder and passive samples. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such a project.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Maryland under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a Single Source, for NIST personnel to develop with the University of Maryland, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS)-based Thermo-pneumatic Valve at the University of Maryland.  The University of Maryland worked with NIST on a previous attempt to develop a MEMS-based thermo-pneumatic valve, which involved Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) fabrication process.  Continuing this project with the University of Maryland will save time.  In addition, this project involves micromachining using novel nickel electroplating within SU8 molds.  Currently, the University of Maryland has several projects involving the nickel plating using SU8 molds.  The novelty of the NIST project, the nature of the microfabrication experimentation, and the expected need to explore several microfabrication paths requires that the microfabrication experimentation for this project is carried out in facilities where expert advice is available in real time.  This will be possible at the University of Maryland and will result in time saving costs for NIST personnel.  Therefore, the University of Maryland is uniquely qualified to work with NIST to complete this requirement.  A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about August 17, 2004.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement, in writing, no later than the response date.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotation nor is it a request for competition.  See Numbered Note 26.

2.	Enhancing Training Capabilities of AGEXPRONT: this component will examine and evaluate the training program presently run by AGEXPRONT and will assist this institution in providing increasingly sophisticated market information and information on Central America Free Trade Agreement to members and students at their Foreign Trade School for exporters.

3.	Advancing the Digital Certificates Program for the Single Export Window: this component involves working with AGEXPRONT to advance the Digital Certificates Project—a key missing piece of the Single Export Window—aimed at making certificates of origin and sanitary-phytosanitary certificates available to exporters electronically. The project will provide Technical Assistance to improve the network infrastructure related to the processing and handling of information related to Guatemalan exports. The project will also assist Guatemalan officials to develop a system for the exchange of certificates with the U.S. and the other CAFTA partners.

<DESC>Purpose
The purpose of this RFI is to seek information from industry on applicable COTS Software Development Collaboration tools and their ability to meet the requirements stated herein.  

Introduction  
Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) provides the foundation for DoD network-centric operations by creating a set of nine core services for joint and service systems to use. NCES is part of the larger Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Services (ES).  The GIG ES supports the entire Department of Defense’s Information Technology (IT) requirements, including the Business and Warfighting domains, as well as interfaces with the National Intelligence Community (IC) domain.  

As the core enterprise services component of the Global Information Grid, NCES is the infrastructure on which Department of Defense (DoD) computer applications (e.g., C2, Combat Support, and Medical) rely.  This new environment must (1) support posting data to common storage spaces as early as possible; (2) alert edge users to changes in relevant DoD information or time-critical events affecting their survival or threatening their mission; (3) provide users, down to the last tactical mile, with the capability to pull whatever they want, whenever they want, from wherever they are and limited only by the commander’s information management policy; (4) ensure information assurance (IA)/security; and (5) support interoperability among allies, coalition, and multinational partners.  NCES relies upon the GIG transport services and tactical communications systems for the exchange between the CESs and the Community of Interest (CoI) capabilities. The nine NCES Core Enterprise Services are defined below:

Enterprise Service Management
The set of services that enables life cycle management of the information environment and that supports all Network Operations (NetOps) activities necessary to operationally manage information flows.  Provides end-to-end GIG performance monitoring, configuration management, event correlation and mission impact assessment, and problem detection/resolution as well as enterprise resource accounting and addressing (e.g., for users, systems, devices).  Web Services Management (WSM) provides the end-to-end management of web services within the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA 

Messaging
Services that support synchronous and asynchronous information exchange. Selected capabilities used to exchange information among users or applications on the enterprise infrastructure  (e.g., Email, DMS, VMF, USMTF, TADIL, OTH, Message Oriented Middleware, AOL instant messenger, Wireless Services, Alert Services).

Discovery
The set of services that enables the formulation and execution of processes to locate data assets (e.g., files, databases, services, directories, web pages, streams) by exploiting metadata descriptions stored in and or generated by IT repositories (e.g., directories, registries, catalogs, repositories, other shared metadata storage).

Mediation
Services that help broker, translate, aggregate, fuse or integrate data, providing capabilities that enable transformation processing (translation, aggregation, integration), situational awareness support (correlation and fusion), negotiation (brokering, trading, and auctioning services) and publishing.

Collaboration
The set of services that allows users to work together and jointly using selected capabilities on the network (i.e., chat, online meetings, work group software etc.).  Collaboration services include synchronous and asynchronous modes enabling ad hoc interaction between disparate participants.  Synchronous services are characterized by real-time point-to-point or peer-to-peer interaction between users and systems (i.e. chat, online meetings, etc.).  Asynchronous services provide collaborative or shared workspaces that facilitate the interaction between disparate persons or groups.  Please note this is a separate product space than Next Generation Collaboration Services (NGCS).

User Assistant
Automated capabilities that learn and apply user preferences and patterns to assist users to efficiently and effectively utilize GIG resources in the performance of tasks.

Security
Capabilities that include addressing vulnerabilities in networks, computing infrastructure, core services, and/or discreet systems. The set of services that provides Defense in Depth to ensure the integrity and continuity of the information environment and the information it stores, processes, maintains, uses, shares, disseminates, disposes, displays, or transmits.

Storage
The set of physical and virtual places available on the network to host data with varying degrees of persistence (e.g., archiving, COOP, content staging)

Application
The set of services necessary to provision, host, operate and manage the assured computing environment.

The nature of GIG Enterprise Services requires a development effort with geographically disparate service providers and software developers leveraging a variety of software and hardware platforms. Collaboration among developers is crucial for the successful development and integration of enterprise services.  This creates the need for a DOD-wide online collaborative development environment that will enable the developer community to effectively communicate and share project resources during the software development life cycle.

DISA is considering the procurement of a COTS Online Software Development Collaboration environment with configuration management, knowledge management, project communication, project management, and architecture development capabilities.  The service must have adequate security and administrative facilities as well as a user-friendly interface.  Additionally, DISA seeks a service that may be fully integrated with the architecture of the NCES Core Enterprise Services.

DISA’s objective is to provide software development collaboration as a service to DOD developers.  The service may need to operate on as many as three networks: the Internet, the DOD Non-Classified IP Router Network (NIPRNET), and the DOD SECRET IP Router Network (SIPRNET). Although NIPRNET and Internet are connected via gateways, access to certain NIPRNET assets is restricted to DOD users, and this may be the case for the software development collaboration services.

Given these environments, DISA is open to various business models:

The vendor sells software to DISA, and DISA integrates the software and operates the service in its facilities.

The vendor sells a turnkey hardware/software system to DISA, and DISA operates the service in its facilities.

The vendor integrates and operates the service in DISA facilities, for a flat or by-subscription fee.

The vendor operates the service in its own facilities, for a flat or by-subscription fee.


Requirements/Capabilities:

Software Configuration Management (SCM)
Maintain version control and iteration history of project artifacts
Track and record changes made to artifacts including who made changes, when the changes were made, and any comments entered about the changes

Allow users to perform “diff” analysis on text files between different versions
Allow users to upload and download multiple files at once
Service shall enable the versioning of files and directories/folders.  This versioning shall allow users to move, copy, and rename files and folders within version control
The version control service shall support atomic commits that will check if all objects are successfully committed into the DB.  If all of the commits are not successful, or updates shall be automatically rolled back and user shall be given status information about the commit
The version control service needs to allow for concurrent versioning.  This will allow multiple users to check out a single file or a set of files at once.  During an update or a check-in, the service shall inform users if a merge needs to take place between the latest version in the server and the user’s working copy.  The service shall allow for automatic merging of documents and give indications on conflicts that prevent merges from taking place. 
The service shall operate over standard protocols (http(s), webdav, etc)
The version control service shall support and complement common development processes (i.e. CMM, AGILE, RUP, Rational).  The service shall be able to work within and enhance these processes in a software development environment.

<DESC>The Economic Research Service (ERS) of the United States Department of Agriculture seeks data on retail food purchases to support analytical intelligence for the Office of the Secretary on current issues, concerns, and trends in the retail food market.  This data is needed to identify the changing trends for broad categories of food products including both fixed- (e.g., frozen orange juice) and random-weight (e.g., ground beef) items.   Data needs consist of quarterly updates containing aggregate summaries of the most recent measures (available with a 4 to 6 week lag) along with two years of historical data on prices, quantities purchased, and total sales volume for various food products (see attached list) on a national, regional, and market (where available) basis across the U.S.  In addition, ERS seeks to purchase custom analyses on an ad-hoc basis.  These analyses would focus on specific issues and the influence they may be having on specific food products, market conditions, demographic groups, or any combination of the above-mentioned items.  (For example, what is the influence of low-carb diets on sales of bakery products and new product introductions?)The data and custom analyses will be used to prepare a quarterly report for the Office of the Secretary and data and analysis will also, when relevant, be used in research leading to publications in academic journals, applied economic journals, ERS technical bulletins, ERS reports, etc.  (ERS does not disseminate or publish proprietary, firm, or establishment level data.)  In addition, ERS conducts staff analyses for internal use.  Internal staff analyses are conducted for the Administration, the Congress, or the Department of Agriculture. 
Specific ERS research goals and objectives include:  1.Produce timely analysis on trends in the retail food market. 2.Identify differences in food prices across markets in the U.S.3.Measure the impact of food purchasing behavior on food prices, accessibility, services, and assortment.4.Compare measures of food purchase behavior to measures of food purchase behavior in the Consumer Expenditure Survey. 5.Determine the types of foods that U.S. households purchase by demographic segment with specific focus on low-income households and how they differ from other demographic groups.6.Identify the prices that households pay for foods purchased and how household demographics, including income, affect prices paid and quantities purchased.7.Assess how low-income households differ in the food choices they make and the prices that they pay for food. ERS occasionally enters into cooperative agreements and memorandums of understanding with academics at Universities to assist us with research priorities and the implementation of economic analyses.  The work may require that we grant access to the data.  However, these agreements require that the data not be released to any other party and that the data be returned to ERS upon completion of the work.  Cooperators are restricted by the provisions of the contract and may not publish or report any portion of the raw data, and may only publish results from the economic analyses. 
Tasks:	1. The contractor shall provide a geographically representative sample of U.S. food purchase data.  It will include quarterly data starting with the third quarter of 2004 and continuing through the first three quarters of 2005 as well as historical quarterly data for the years 2002, 2003, and 2004.  This data will be aggregated quarterly data that is representative of food purchases on a national, regional, and market level (where available) for all stores where food is commonly purchased.  The data must include measures for average price paid per unit, total quantities purchased, total dollar sales, and percent changes from previous quarter, and year ago quarter for each of these three measures. The data must include estimates for these measures both for all stores, as well as for specific store types or retail channels.  Data must include all major food categories specified in the attached list which include meats, poultry, fish, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and dry grocery products (see attached list).2.  The contractor shall provide analytical support for 5 to 10 special requests based on the most recent data on prices and quantities purchased.  For example, information on unanticipated, high-profile issues, such as BSE, or the effects of the low-carbohydrate diets on food purchase behavior.  These analyses will provide ERS with the ability to quickly obtain attitude, health, and knowledge information from household panel participants through both current existing data and customized survey questions used to collect new data.  Acceptance standards will be clarified for each request for analysis at the time of the request. To undertake planned research, we require a complete description of sample design. In addition to sample weights, other relevant data (such as strata and clusters) should be included as well as a data description dictionary that provides a full explanation of any abbreviated terms in the data.Period of Performance will be one year, which will begin from the date of the award.  There will be periodic data and analysis requests throughout the year as requested by the office.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/INDUSTRY DAYS FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III) ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought/Industry Days Parts and  Repair Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program functions much the same as an Air Logistics Center.  The  contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance  services and the management of task orders.  The contract is managed by a  dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s performance  and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However, the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.

The  contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance  services and the management of task orders.  The contract is managed by a  dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s performance  and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS II are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However, the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. Note: See chart one for how the PROS II program process works.  SAMIS stands  for Security Assistance Management Information System. Developmental Phase PROS III the Follow-on to PROS II  We are entering the developmental phase of the follow-on to PROS II.   Chart Two Explanation Chart shows PR (purchase request) being offered up to contractors A and B (1)  for competitive supply/maintenance fill action.  Contractors A and B in competition with each other go to their OEM partners or  competitive vendors (2) for quotes. Price and Lead Time (LT) are provided to the USAF by contractors A and B (3)  and the USAF then selects the best offer (4). The contractor (A or B) with the best offer receives the order (5) and they  issue a contract (6) with the appropriate vendor. Shipment is made as quoted (7) and services charges are paid (8). Winner takes all.  The loosing contractor receives no recompense for their  efforts unless they win an award to fill an order. Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Possible options include, but would not be limited to, multiple award and other  Governmental agencies receiving orders with respect to contractor B. Goal Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.  We are  soliciting comments from industry on the attached approach (chart two) with  regard to feasibility, suggested incentives and interest in PROS III  participation. 3.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/INDUSTRY DAYS FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III) ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought/Industry Days Parts and  Repair Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program functions much the same as an Air Logistics Center.  The  contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance  services and the management of task orders.  The contract is managed by a  dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s performance  and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not  a National Stock Number (NSN).

However, the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.

Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.   NOTE: The Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the  previous and current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution.

<RESPDATE>012104
<CONTACT>Stephen Cannon, Contract Specialist, Phone 843-820-7037, Fax null, Email stephen.l.cannon@navy.mil
<DESC>CORRECTION: THE SOLICITATION TITLE IS MODIFIED TO READ IDIQ DESIGN-BUILD/BID-BUILD CATHODIC PROTECTION CONTRACTS FOR ACTIVITIES IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS WORLD-WIDE. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. It is the Governments intention to award a Multiple Award Construction Contract-MACC. This procurement is for one solicitation resulting in the award of up to four Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity Design-Build and-or Bid-Build Contracts. The Two Phase Design-Build Request for Proposal procedures will be utilized for this procurement. The work will primarily consist of general cathodic protection installation projects, new construction and repair of existing cathodic protection systems, including but not limited to impressed current cathodic protection systems and galvanic cathodic protection systems for activities worldwide. Work may also include corrosion control through the application of coatings, however this is only a minor portion of the anticipated work. This solicitation intends to award of up to four Indefinite Quantity Design-Build and-or Bid-Build Contracts with potential for firm fixed price task orders. The base period shall consist of 365 calendar days with up to four one-year option periods. The option years may be exercised by the Government during which separate Task Orders for projects may be issued. The estimated value for all four contracts is $15 million with a total maximum not-to-exceed amount of $25 million. Each contract will consist of a one base year with up to four option years. The anticipated range for each task order is between $50,000 and $500,000 with most task orders falling in the range of $150,000 to $300,000. The Government reserves the right to award up to four contracts under this solicitation or to award only one contract covering only the seed project identified under the solicitation. The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-04-R-0448. There is no set maximum amount under each of the up to four contracts that may be awarded as a result of this solicitation other than that the total amount for all task orders issued during the five year term, regardless of the number of contracts awarded, will not exceed the total amount of $25 million. After award of the initial contracts, only the successful offerors will compete for future task orders based on either Best Value to the Government or Lowest Price Technically Acceptable. The successful offerors will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. The Government intends for all MACC contractors to actively participate and submit proposals on each task order. Failure to participate may result in the Government exercising its right NOT to award an option period. Participation in the pre-proposal conference and site visits for future task orders will be the responsibility of the offerors and are not directly reimbursable by the Government. Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services. Projects will also require incorporation of sustainable features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of projects to be awarded during the term of this contract. Professional registration or certification is required in the state where the projects are located as needed to obtain construction environmental permits and to comply with agency regulations. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to 3 to 7 offerors Design-Build and-or Bid-Build teams based on Design-Build and-or Bid-Build factors that Qualifications, including proposed subcontractors, Management include: Past Performance, Technical Approach, and Small Business Subcontracting Effort. Phase I Design-Build and-or Bid-Build factors relate to the FIVE year IDIQ contract requirements for general cathodic protection type projects including, new construction and renovations, but not limited to particular facilities such as petroleum, oil and lubricant-POL-facilities; waterfront structures; utility systems-water, natural gas, steam, etc.; or other areas where cathodic protection and corrosion control is applied. Work may also include minor construction or repair of government facilities and utilities such as POL piping systems, fuel storage tanks and utility systems. Work may also include performing cathodic protection surveys-structure to electrolyte potential surveys-close interval surveys, etcor American Petroleum Institute-API-inspections-API 570, API 610, etc.; or general preventative maintenance work-painting, grading, etc.-on projects other than the seed project identified in Part 4 of Section 00150 of the RFP for activities located world-wide. Although the work will not be primarily in one location, locations of task orders in the first contract year will likely be: Fleet Industrial Support Center (FISC) Pearl Harbor (HA), NAS Oceana (VA), Air Reserve Station Willow Grove (PA), various locations in Japan including Misawa Air Base in Northern Japan, Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan, Yokota Air Base near Tokyo, and various locations in South Korea.  The Korean Air Bases may include Osan, Kunsan, Taegu, Suwon, and Kwang-ju.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I may participate in the Phase II process. Also, the Government may not release the names of the Phase II firms selected to compete. In Phase II, the Government will require the competitive field to submit a technical and price proposal for a SEED project. The Phase II technical proposal will evaluate the Past Performance; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; Technical Qualifications; and Technical Solution which will require preparation of a limited design solution, and other elements  that define the maintainability of the CP system and schedule adherence. Cost and Price proposal may include total cost or evaluation of scope-design options within the Government’s published budget for award. The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed project-s. It is anticipated the offeror-s awarded the seed project-s will meet the minimum guarantee amount. A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract-s. The minimum guarantee may be payable only if the offeror-s are awarded no task orders over the term of their contract. Per the Debt Collections Improvement Act of 1996, The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement-DFAR requires all contractors to register in the Department of Defense-DOD Central Contract Registration-CCR- Database. Be advised, failure to register in the CCR makes an offeror ineligible for award of DOD contracts. Information regarding this registration may be obtained by accessing the web site at http://www.ccr.gov. FOR SPECIFICATIONS: The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only. Phase I will be issued on or about 18 December 2003. Phase I proposals will be due around 21 January 2004. PHASE II WILL BE ISSUED AT A LATER DATE. Both Phase I and Phase II, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil. Prospective Offerors MUST register on the web site.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Human & Robotic Technology which was posted on Jun 29, 2004. You are notified that the following changes are made: Posting of additional Question and Answer and a revision to the BAA, Section II.3, "Guidelines for Foreign Participation" The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/HQ Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=04  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). A link to briefing charts and further details on the Broad Agency Announcement is located at: https://naccsli1.msfc.nasa.gov/ExplorationPortal 1. Question/Answer Q39.  Will any system design tools that support these technology activities be measured on a similar TRL schedule, and is there an expectation of discussing the commercialization potential of these tools in these proposals similar to the way SBIRs technology solicitations are crafted? A39.  We are coordinating with our requirements office the details of developing a very strong systems design simulation base model that they have in mind. The development of this model is not part of this BAA.  We are also in the process of developing a simulation based acquisition approach, which will be outlined in our system-engineering plan. The details are also not part of this BAA.   The detailed goals and objectives that are applicable to SBIR are somewhat different than the overall H&RT portfolio. You should refer back to the formulation plan and take a careful look at the overarching goals and objectives and we are interested in assuring that the technology investments that we make in the pursuit of the exploration vision have good value to the U.S. economy.  This BAA is not geared towards developing any commercial technology. 2.  Revision to Foreign Participation. “At NASA's pre-solicitation conference on July 29, 2004, and in the days following this event, NASA received questions concerning the procedures for considering foreign funded proposals. To avoid misinterpretation of our intent, NASA has clarified this language in response to these questions. This clarification can be found at section II.3, Guidelines for Foreign Participation." The text of this change is as follows: II. Eligibility Information 3.	Guidelines for Foreign Participation A key challenge for NASA is to develop new capabilities in a manner that is flexible in order to incorporate new technologies, as well as agile in order to respond to scientific discoveries.  Based upon the complexity of the enabling research and technology necessary to support affordable and sustainable Moon and Mars exploration, NASA seeks the broadest possible industry participation and competition in response to this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for research and technology.  This is in order to meet the needs of Exploration System’s stated strategy and objectives for incremental (spiral) development, and to address technology gaps in a timely manner as described herein.	In order to obtain the most innovative and potentially most effective research and technology from the broadest array of sources, NASA has approved a deviation to the NASA FAR Supplement 1835.016-70 entitled, “Foreign participation under broad agency announcements.”  This deviation, which applies to this BAA only, allows NASA to provide direct funding to foreign entities without requiring a waiver by the Office of External Relations (OER).	 In keeping with NASA’s goal to seek the broadest participation and competition possible, NASA will continue to consider proposals with foreign sponsorship as outlined in subsection (3) below.  The deviation referenced in the paragraph above does not change the process that proposals with foreign sponsorship should follow.   Specific requirements for OER approval, are still required, and are outlined below. OER will review for eligibility for selection, all foreign proposals and U.S. proposals with foreign participation, to ensure consistency with all applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders and policies governing export control, non-proliferation, and trade.  Trade policy review will include trade policies of the foreign participant’s Government concerning U.S. firms and intellectual property rights.   The following requirements apply to foreign proposals and U.S. proposals that include foreign participation: (1) All foreign proposals must be typewritten in English and comply with all other submission requirements stated in this BAA.  All foreign proposals will undergo the same evaluation and selection process as those originating in the U.S., except as noted herein. (2) The Office of Exploration Systems will contact successful and unsuccessful foreign entities.  Copies of these letters will be sent to the foreign sponsor in the case of foreign government endorsed proposals and foreign sponsored U.S. proposals that include foreign participation.	 (3) Should a foreign government sponsored proposal or a joint U.S.-foreign proposal with foreign sponsored participation, be selected, NASA's Office of External Relations will arrange with the foreign sponsor for the proposed participation on a no-exchange-of-funds basis, in which NASA and the foreign sponsoring agency will each bear the cost of discharging their respective responsibilities.	Depending on the nature and extent of the proposed cooperation, these arrangements may entail: ·	An exchange of letters between NASA and the foreign sponsor; or ·	A formal Agency-to-Agency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). As previously noted, a deviation from the NASA FAR supplement will allow NASA to fund foreign proposals that do not have foreign government sponsorship. The revised BAA is located at the website referenced above. In addition a typographical error revising the Project Type in the NOI form is corrected on the revised BAA (Revises the type from ASSP to ASPS).

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina has a requirement Phoenix dialysis system. Sources are being sought for a Phoenix system that meets the requirements of the medical center. The unit must have a dialysate delivery system that uses disposable sodium bicarbonate cartridges and bicarbonate concentrate. The membrane must be heat disinfected by the machine with an on-line production of ultrapure dialysate. The system must also have a low consumption mode that reduces the use of O water, acid, and bicarbonate concentrate. Any firm that believes it can provide a system that meets the above requirements may give written notification to Barbara Simmons, Contracting Officer, VA Medical Center, Hampton, Virginia within seven days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the VA Medical Center will proceed with a sole source negotiation with GAMBRO, the only known source that has a Phoenix system.

<DESC>A high resolution computed tomography (CT) system with fast data acquisition and fast image reconstruction is required at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (NASA/KSC).  In order to obtain the optimum system, NASA/KSC intends to embark on a two step approach.  The first step is to request information from potential vendors (RFI) and the second step is a procurement via a request for quotation (RFQ).  NASA is currently seeking information for industry.  The new system will either be an upgrade to an extant CT system or, alternately, a disparate, stand-alone system.	The best way to achieve the desired end goal will be primarily left to the vendors with input from NASA/KSC personnel.  NASA/KSC currently has an industrial CT system that was built by Scientific Measurements Systems (SMS) in 1985.  It is a model 201, recently upgraded via addition of new computing capability, motion control stages and corresponding software, and is in active service.  In addition, NASA/KSC has a bay that contains an existing microfocus X-ray source with image intensifier detector.  This is also an active system.  Further, NASA/KSC has a bay that contains a 420KVp head and a cobalt 60 source.	These sources are used for conventional projection radiography and are also active.  It is the intent that the new CT system will be housed in one of these three bays, while maintaining current x-ray capabilities.    Requirements: 1.  Spatial resolution  The necessary spatial resolution, established via ASTM E1695-95, is to be 4lp/mm, or better, at 50% modulation.  This is 125 um.  2.   Density Range If the extant system is upgraded, the upgrade should be capable of handling work pieces with a material density range of 0 to 15 grams per cubic centimeter in order to maintain existing capabilities. 3.  Object Size If the extant system is upgraded, the upgrade should be capable of accommodating objects planed to fit within a cube approximately 5 feet on a side, in order to maintain existing capabilities.  However, the actual objects are NOT solids of this dimension.  Rather these are shell-like but of this general size. 4.  Speed It is desired that the data over such a volume, and resultant images, be acquired and displayed within a continuous 24 hour period.   5.  Special Reconstruction Considerations It is desired that the software for this system have the capability for localized reconstruction (Region Of Interest). 6.  Data considerations If the extant system is upgraded, the upgrade should ensure that planar, contiguous, CT data sets be obtainable in a scanning envelope of 1500mm by 1500mm. Pitch between slices must be obtainable in increments such that 100% sampling of data is achievable for subsequent 3-D reconstructions and/or secondary oblique planar CT views of selected sections.  Volumetric 3D reconstruction preferred (cone beam utilizing area array or repositioning of linear array).  Pseudo 3D slice-type reconstruction (fan beam utilizing liner array) required as a minimum. 7.   Scintillator  Optimum efficiency scintillator material(s) for x-ray and gamma ray conversion shall be described by vendor. 8.  Computing Platforms and Software  It will be left to the vendor to select the computing platform, operating system, algorithm for reconstruction and image generation.  However, the operating system selected, and the memory capability, must be adequate to meet the needs.  While it is recognized that use of shared memories of high capacity computers at remote sites is a possibility for handling large data sets, it is the intent of this system to have the computer on site.  Output image file formats and raw data files are to be accessible and transportable. Supplemental Information Provided Upon Request: Floor diagrams showing present wall thicknesses, with recent radiation safety data for each of the walls. Information on proposed solutions to the above requirements should be forwarded to Mr. Steve McDanels, Chief, YA-F1, Failure Analysis and Materials Evaluation Branch, NASA, KSC 32931.  Mr. McDanels phone number is (321) 861-8969.  Interested vendors are requested to provide the following information: 1)  Hardware and software performance verification and warranties 2)  Service support options 3)  Provisions for Government access to software source code 4)  Evidence of demonstrated capability to successfully complete project 5)  Milestone chart reflecting performance period and major events during system implementation at KSC 6)  Brief description of facilities, resources and project key personnel Electronic information and questions can be emailed to Steve.McDanels@nasa.gov.   Note that this is not a solicitation.  Responses are not considered binding and will not effect the Government's consideration of a firm for a future contract.	Do not send information that is proprietary or business sensitive.	Any questions related to procurement matters can be directed to Dave Reeves at 321-867-3999.     Responses need to be provided by September 4, 2004.

THIS IS A 3RD POSTING OF A NOTICE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY POSTED ON JULY 8, 2004.  IT CONTAINS THE SAME INFORMATION AS THE 2ND POSTING, BUT CORRECTS A TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR IN THE REFERENCE NUMBER BLOCK.

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland seeks to identify potential sources that currently can provide, or will soon be able to provide, commercially available, or soon-to-be commercially available, slap fingerprint segmentation software.  Such software may be selected by the Government to participate in the Slap Fingerprint Segmentation Evaluation 2004 (SlapSeg04), a government-sponsored technology evaluation of algorithms used to segment slap fingerprint images.

Note: Slap fingerprints (slaps) are also known as four-finger simultaneous plain impressions; slaps are taken by simultaneously pressing the four fingers of each hand onto a scanner or fingerprint card.  Slap segmentation is the process by which a single image containing four fingerprint images is divided into four images of the individual fingers.

Potential sources of such software will neither be funded by NIST, nor charged by NIST, to participate in SlapSeg04.  Rules for SlapSeg04 participants are outlined in the HOW TO PARTICIPATE page at http://fingerprint.nist.gov/slapseg04.  A deadline for submission is shown on the CALENDAR page of http://fingerprint.nist.gov/slapseg04.  INTERESTED PARTIES MUST SUBMIT INFORMATION TO slapseg04@nist.gov, AND CONTACT THAT SAME EMAIL ADDRESS WITH ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Division of Procurement Management (DPM) has a requirement to modify Contract Number 232-01-0059 with IQSolutions, Rockville, Maryland, to implement the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Application Processing for the Scholarship Program Information Center.  IQSolutions is the only responsible source determined to provide highly specialized services to meet the requirements of the NHSC Scholarship Program. IQSolutions: 1) has a proprietary interactive on-line interview scheduler/module which allows real-time scheduling of interviews and seamlessly propagates changes throughout the system, allows users to manage information in a single location, and ensures that efforts will not be lost or duplicated; 2) has a data system in place which interacts with the BHCDANET mainframe database currently being used by the Bureau, thus enabling  the update and edit of applicant information critical to award selection; 3) has developed and implemented an interview protocol that includes infrastructure building, quality control measures and direct oversight of the interview process; and 4) as a result of the existing database infrastructure, can more readily assist the NHSC Scholarship program with processing of online applications during the transition from BHCDANET to Primecare, which is being implemented in October 2004. IQSolutions has current skilled employees who have completed the interview training module protocol and have the backgrounds/expertise which would prevent learning curve inefficiencies and/or related interview delays. New staff would require training, resulting in unacceptable delays in the interview cycle. The modification will extend the period of performance to September 29, 2005.  Under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253©(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a), IQSolutions is deemed the only responsible source capable of performing the required services and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements without substantial duplication of cost to the Government and without unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  It is critical to the mission of HRSA that the services being provided by IQSolutions continue uninterrupted and without loss of functionality. Concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement which demonstrates the ability to provide the required services by the specified date. No solicitation document is available; therefore, requests for such document will be considered invalid responses. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no affirmative responses are received within 45 days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer will proceed with award of the modification to IQSolutions. NAICS code: 541990.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation RFQ 259-021-04 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  This solicitation is issued in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 512110 and Small Business Size Standard of $25.0 Million per annum.  The VISN 19 Rocky Mountain Consolidated Contracting Center, Glendale, Colorado intends to contract for services for production of a training video addressing Opportunities for Leadership Development of VISN 19 employees.  Period of performance shall be 90 days from date of award, based on schedule of deliverables provided herein.  Offerors shall provide pricing for the following line items – 01) “VISN 19 Employee Leadership Development” Video without the Government-Furnished Equipment listed under Section Specific Tasks, Paragraph (f)(2).  Line Item – 02) “VISN 19 Employee Leadership Development” Video including the Government-Furnished  Equipment listed under Section Specific Tasks, Paragraph (f)(2).  Contractor shall provide the following services.  Scope:  One firm fixed-price contract will be awarded to provide the concept and completion of a video program designed to provide information on “Opportunities for VISN 19 Employees” in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Rocky Mountain Veterans Integrated Service Network 19 (VISN 19).  Since the Human Resources committee in VISN 19 is addressing the growing need to develop new leaders to replace those who will be retiring in large numbers in the next few years, VISN 19 would like to produce a video for VISN-wide use that identifies available avenues for training and advancement in our system.  More specifically, a video could highlight advancement opportunities for VISN 19 employees through the Leadership Development Institute (LDI), Executive Career Field (ECF), Leadership VA (LVA) and other specific technical development programs such as finance and procurement.  The video could showcase individual VISN 19 employees who have utilized these programs and provide personal stories of how these programs have helped them develop leadership skills while advancing their career opportunities in the VA.  Individuals like Ralph Gigliotti, Associate Director at the Eastern Colorado Health Care System, could articulate how he has come up in the VA system to where he is now and what he aspires to in the future, thus motivating employees throughout the VISN.  There are others likewise who could be showcased to advance the objectives in the network by using real life examples of how available programs enhance VISN employees at any level and facility.  VISN 19 Description:  VISN 19 includes the states of Montana, Utah, most of Colorado and Wyoming and parts of Idaho and Nevada.  There are 31 Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC’s) that are smaller community-based health care facilities that are scattered throughout VISN 19.  The major VA Health Care facilities within VISN 19 are located in: Cheyenne, Wyoming; Denver, Colorado; Grand Junction, Colorado; Helena, Montana; Salt Lake City, Utah; Sheridan, Wyoming.  Background Information:  (a) Target Audience - All employees of VISN 19 will benefit from knowing about these upward-mobility programs, and one specific intention is to show the video to all new employees as part of their New Employee Orientation program.  However, the target audience most likely to benefit from viewing the video is those employees who have the greatest degree of potential to move up the employment ranks, such as those in the lower pay scale ranges and middle-management employees. (b) Objective and Desired Outcome - The objective of the video program is to inform VISN 19 employees of the opportunities for them to voluntarily attend training programs that are designed to help them move upward in the ranks of employment to positions of leadership.  The desired outcome is to demonstrate that the VISN is truly committed to giving employees opportunities for advancement, with the ultimate outcome being that employees take advantage of the opportunities and choose to become career leaders within the VA.  (c) Subject Source - The Government will provide the majority of the content information, to include documents and subject matter experts.  The project shall require research on the part of the Contractor to complete the development of the script.  The research may include, but is not limited to: contacting people such as employees who are currently in, or graduates of the leadership programs to be featured; reading background material that is either provided or discovered by the Contractor; performing library or internet searches for additional information.  (d) Program Functionality - The video will be duplicated and made available for use throughout VISN 19 for the VA Medical Centers, Community-Based Outpatient Clinics, and New Employee Orientation programs.  It is expected to have an enduring value of at least two years.

The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) shall approve each phase of the project.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to award a firm-fixed price Purchase Order (PO) for regular aviation industry-specific data updates for our Regal Decision Systems’ staffing modeling system.  Original award is for three months, with two one-year option periods.  This requirement is set-aside for small businesses.

The TSA anticipates award by Wednesday, June 30, 2004 with an anticipated start date of July 1, 2004.  Award will be made to the offeror whose quote is considered to be of best value to the Government. 

BACKGROUND:  During 2002, all passenger and property screening was taken over by Federal screeners and related personnel as mandated by Congress under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act.  Significant effort resulted in the planning, staffing and training of over 50,000 positions.  During 2003/2004 a significant effort was initiated with REGAL Decision Systems to develop a comprehensive staffing modeling system to be used as a tool for the TSA in planning capacity, establishing staffing budgets, and scheduling staff at the TSA airports. With the completion of this effort scheduled mid 2004, we now require a Data Sustainability Phase which will provide updated aviation industry specific data on a regular and ongoing basis.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  All commercial USA airline data that is required to operate the REGAL staffing model system must be provided monthly in a specific format for updating the system.  This information must include data for scheduled and unscheduled airline service such as:
Airport, Terminal, Airline, Operator, Flight Number, Destination, Equipment Type, Departure Time, Days of Operation, Effective Date, Discontinue Date, Sector, Seats, Stage Length, Number of Available Seats per Aircraft, Terminal or Concourse location of each Flight, Load Factors, Connecting %, Passenger Arrival Curves, Passengers Per Group, Bags Per Passenger, Seasonality Impact on Bags Per Passenger, Percent Oversize, Bags, Seasonality Impact on Arrivals, Contact Ratio/Check-In Split.

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>Please note that the anticipated award date has been moved to mid-July, but the due date for responses remains the same.  Offerors with a reasonable chance for award will be invited to give an oral presentation of their response to the Government.  

Questions and Answers are as follows:
Q.	Can you provide a list of the data sources that Regal Decision Systems has used for their model, since using the same sources (assuming alternate sources are not superior in quality) would be beneficial from consistency and compatibility standpoint?
A.	 No, this could be a potential conflict of interest in some cases, and are not relevant in others.	

Q.	Has Regal Decision Systems been allowed to participate in this bidding? If not, would you be able to recommend a point of contact at Regal Decision Systems to discuss model related issues?
A.	No, Regal is not bidding on this contract, and we can provide a contact but need to know who is asking what type of question in order to provide an appropriate point of contact.  

Q.	Considering that some of the data needed might be considered proprietary to
the data owners (airlines, airports, etc.) would TSA provide a “mandate” for the contractor to facilitate sharing of such data?
A.	No. Initially the successful contractor will need to provide the data from their own sources or from what is in the public domain.  Our intent is to improve the quality of the data by working with the airlines, airports and industry organizations in coordination with the contractor.

Q.	Would TSA allow the contractor to be reimbursed for the possible costs of acquiring not-published data and to exclude such costs estimate from the quote due June 25th?
A.	TSA will not separately reimburse the contractor candidate for acquiring non-public data for the purpose of bidding on this contract.  Any costs incurred by the contractor candidate must be recovered through the successful bidding for this contract.  
	If you wish to exclude the costs of acquiring not-published data in your response, please do so, and note as much in the response.  This may be negotiable.  

Q.	Can TSA supply a complete list of the airports and terminals that shall be considered to be within the scope of this contract?
A.	There are in excess of 450 airports currently serviced by TSA and in the scope of the contract.  However, additions and deletions to this list occur frequently and TSA will provide the list of airports that require data at any point in time.  The important realization is that this is not a static list, and the contractor must be able to add and subtract to the list as required. The contractor should expect the list to change by +/- 5% annually.

Q.	Is there any additional directions related to the scope of this project not included in the RFQ?
A.	The contractor must be willing to work with TSA in using data that may become available to TSA from other sources, and in working with TSA to acquire additional and/or better quality data.	

Q.	Can you confirm when the first batch of data must be provided? The Statement of Work (paragraph 3.4 on the last page) seems to indicate that it is only one day after the anticipated award date of June 30, 2004. 
A.	Approximately August 16, 2004.  (Please note that the anticipated award date has been moved out to mid-July.)

Q.	What does "NSP" in attachment B mean?
A.	Not Separately Priced

Q. 	 Some data items such as load factors and originating percentages can only be obtained after the FY2004 cycle (after 9/30/2004), but they are listed as part of deliverables for July 1, 2004.  
A. 	TSA is requesting that the most current, highest quality information is supplied.  Please note any circumstances such as this in your response.  

Q.	The scope of work does not address the FIS re-check/ re-screening. Is International-to-Domestic transfer passenger screening part of the scope? Does TSA request any data related to that?
A. 	This work is not excluded in the RFQ, but should be in the scope of the contract

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to award a firm-fixed price Purchase Order (PO) for regular aviation industry-specific data updates for our Regal Decision Systems’ staffing modeling system.  Original award is for three months, with two one-year option periods.  This requirement is set-aside for small businesses.

The TSA anticipates award by Wednesday, June 30, 2004 with an anticipated start date of July 1, 2004.  Award will be made to the offeror whose quote is considered to be of best value to the Government. 

BACKGROUND:  During 2002, all passenger and property screening was taken over by Federal screeners and related personnel as mandated by Congress under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act.  Significant effort resulted in the planning, staffing and training of over 50,000 positions.  During 2003/2004 a significant effort was initiated with REGAL Decision Systems to develop a comprehensive staffing modeling system to be used as a tool for the TSA in planning capacity, establishing staffing budgets, and scheduling staff at the TSA airports. With the completion of this effort scheduled mid 2004, we now require a Data Sustainability Phase which will provide updated aviation industry specific data on a regular and ongoing basis.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  All commercial USA airline data that is required to operate the REGAL staffing model system must be provided monthly in a specific format for updating the system.  This information must include data for scheduled and unscheduled airline service such as:
Airport, Terminal, Airline, Operator, Flight Number, Destination, Equipment Type, Departure Time, Days of Operation, Effective Date, Discontinue Date, Sector, Seats, Stage Length, Number of Available Seats per Aircraft, Terminal or Concourse location of each Flight, Load Factors, Connecting %, Passenger Arrival Curves, Passengers Per Group, Bags Per Passenger, Seasonality Impact on Bags Per Passenger, Percent Oversize, Bags, Seasonality Impact on Arrivals, Contact Ratio/Check-In Split. 

A comprehensive list of data is provided in the RFQ documents.

Please contact Heather Morvant at:  Heather.Morvant@dhs.gov to have all documents transmitted.  These include:  Instructions, Attachment A - Company Information, Attachment B - Pricing, Attachment C - Statement of Work.

All attachments must be received in order to submit an offer.

<DESC>IRAQ COUNTRY ORIENTATION COURSE - Questions and Answers below: Question:   On page 3 for the cost summary under CLIN 002 lectures, there is a statement that per lecture cost will not exceed $300.00. Although we would be delivering many lectures, we would anticipate bringing in guest lectures from academia and industry and it would be difficult to meet the $300.00 per lecture limit. Are we understanding this requirement properly and the $300.00 is the limit for each lecture? Answer: Yes, $300.00 is the limit for each lecture. Under the contract, the $300.00 pays for the lecture ONLY not including other expenses (airfare, per diem, meals, taxi, and private own vehicle, etc.). If the service includes paying for the lecture, travel expenses, and other fees, a separate contract (non-competitive) will be written (BUT REQUIRES FSI PRIOR APPROVAL).

6 Project Descriptions and Profile

Established in 1994, the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union, l’Union Economique et Monetaire Ouest-Africaine (UEMOA) member countries includes: Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Senegal, Togo, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger.  The organization is headquartered in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.  

UEMOA’s Transport Infrastructure Program focuses on road infrastructure, railway development, and transport facilitation.  Key components of the program include developing information systems for network monitoring and regulation, facilitating interstate road transport and transit, and facilitating port procedures.  The program is designed to reflect the regional objectives of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).  Many of the Program’s short- and medium-term projects are a part of NEPAD’s list of priority regional infrastructure projects.  More specifically, the program includes the following:

Road Infrastructure:  
Road infrastructure in the region suffers from a lack of coordination of road development projects between member states, weaknesses in the management of road networks, and inadequate information and performance indicator systems.  Although the interstate road network has surfaced roads connecting major cities, the roads are in need of rehabilitation and modernization.  Two major corridors are the Bamako (Mali)-Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso)-Accra (Ghana) Corridor and the Niamey (Niger)-Ouagadougou-Accra Corridor.  

Railway Infrastructure:
The railway infrastructure throughout the UEMOA member states is in a poor state and is in need of modernization and development.  The lack of a reliable railway network greatly inhibits the region’s inter-community and international trade.  The major regional interconnection projects underway are the interconnection of the existing railways of Benin, Burkina Faso, and Togo, involving 2000 km of railway, and the extension of the rail line of Mali-Senegal-Côte d’Ivoire-Togo, involving 560 km of railway.  There are other important lines in need of restoration and conversion to standard gauge rail spacing, covering a total of 3308 km of railways including Dakar (Senegal)-Bamako line, the Cotonou (Benin)-Parakou (Benin) line, the Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire)-Ouagadougou line, and the Lome (Togo)-Blitta (Togo) line.

Transport Facilitation:
Interstate transport is limited in the region.  The application of agreements, regional regulations, and national practices have proven ineffective in the past.  UEMOA is now trying a new approach of identifying tariff and non-tariff barriers; analyzing key trade corridors; and addressing issues associated with port transit procedures, checkpoints, etc.  The program is designed to reduce transport costs and increase regional competitiveness.  The program has identified three key corridors to begin the program in: the Abidjan-Ouagadougou Corridor with continuation to Niamey, the Lome-Ouagadougou Corridor with continuation to Niamey, and the Tema (Ghana)-Ouagadougou Corridor with continuation to Niamey.  

Aviation:
The UEMOA member states have proposed an aviation sector development plan for the region that would be similar to Cooperative Development of Operational Safety and Continuing Airworthiness Programme (COSCAP) projects that are being implemented in other regions such as South America, the Asia-Pacific, and the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).  The objectives of the program include developing and integrating an efficient regional air transport system that is compliant with international standards, as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); promoting efficient civil aviation management; converging national safety and security policies, and facilitating commercial exchanges through air transport.

6 Project Descriptions and Profile

Established in 1994, the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union, l’Union Economique et Monetaire Ouest-Africaine (UEMOA) member countries includes: Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Senegal, Togo, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger.  The organization is headquartered in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.  

UEMOA’s Transport Infrastructure Program focuses on road infrastructure, railway development, and transport facilitation.  Key components of the program include developing information systems for network monitoring and regulation, facilitating interstate road transport and transit, and facilitating port procedures.  The program is designed to reflect the regional objectives of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).  Many of the Program’s short- and medium-term projects are a part of NEPAD’s list of priority regional infrastructure projects.  More specifically, the program includes the following:

Road Infrastructure:  
Road infrastructure in the region suffers from a lack of coordination of road development projects between member states, weaknesses in the management of road networks, and inadequate information and performance indicator systems.  Although the interstate road network has surfaced roads connecting major cities, the roads are in need of rehabilitation and modernization.  Two major corridors are the Bamako (Mali)-Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso)-Accra (Ghana) Corridor and the Niamey (Niger)-Ouagadougou-Accra Corridor.  

Railway Infrastructure:
The railway infrastructure throughout the UEMOA member states is in a poor state and is in need of modernization and development.  The lack of a reliable railway network greatly inhibits the region’s inter-community and international trade.  The major regional interconnection projects underway are the interconnection of the existing railways of Benin, Burkina Faso, and Togo, involving 2000 km of railway, and the extension of the rail line of Mali-Senegal-Côte d’Ivoire-Togo, involving 560 km of railway.  There are other important lines in need of restoration and conversion to standard gauge rail spacing, covering a total of 3308 km of railways including Dakar (Senegal)-Bamako line, the Cotonou (Benin)-Parakou (Benin) line, the Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire)-Ouagadougou line, and the Lome (Togo)-Blitta (Togo) line.

Transport Facilitation:
Interstate transport is limited in the region.  The application of agreements, regional regulations, and national practices have proven ineffective in the past.  UEMOA is now trying a new approach of identifying tariff and non-tariff barriers; analyzing key trade corridors; and addressing issues associated with port transit procedures, checkpoints, etc.  The program is designed to reduce transport costs and increase regional competitiveness.  The program has identified three key corridors to begin the program in: the Abidjan-Ouagadougou Corridor with continuation to Niamey, the Lome-Ouagadougou Corridor with continuation to Niamey, and the Tema (Ghana)-Ouagadougou Corridor with continuation to Niamey.  

Aviation:
The UEMOA member states have proposed an aviation sector development plan for the region that would be similar to Cooperative Development of Operational Safety and Continuing Airworthiness Programme (COSCAP) projects that are being implemented in other regions such as South America, the Asia-Pacific, and the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).  The objectives of the program include developing and integrating an efficient regional air transport system that is compliant with international standards, as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); promoting efficient civil aviation management; converging national safety and security policies, and facilitating commercial exchanges through air transport.
