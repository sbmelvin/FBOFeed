<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs New Mexico VA Health Care System intends to solicit proposal from contractors within the Albuquerque and Santa Fe city limits to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about August 9, 2010, with a closing date for proposals on or about August 31, 2010.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation an any amendments.

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of the solicitation will be to obtain proposals from contractors who can provide care, treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans suffering from serious mental illness, including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals.  The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.  Due to the urgent nature of this requirement, contractors will be required to demonstrate their ability to provide services within a 2-week period after contract award.  Initial contract awards are expected to be on or about October 1,  2010.  Contracts will have a base term of one year, with options for four additional one-year terms exercisable in the discretion of the VA.   

The government will use a best value source selection method under Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and anticipates making multiple awards (two) of fixed price, indefinite delivery, requirements contracts for this requirement.

NAICS Code is 624229 and the solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Agency.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration data base at www.ccr.gov.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit that CCR website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award. Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist using the e-mail link provided.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) intends to acquire TAM-4510, TAM-4410 and TAM-2639 Argos Satellite Transmitters.
<p>The salient characteristics for brand name or equal:</p>
<p>The TAM-26xx series provides a small, light weight package for smaller species or juveniles. Data such as last dive time, dive count, maximum and average dive time, percentage of time spent under water and temperature can be transmitted. Model TAM-2639 <br />Dimensions (in, cm): 1.3 x 2.6 x 1.2;3.2 x 6.6 x 3.0 <br />Unit Weight (g): 90<br />Onboard Memory for Data Logging: No <br />Low power (mW): 150 <br />Number of Transmissions Low power: 205920 <br />Low power temp (&deg;C): -20 to +60 <br />High power (mW): 250 (Typ) <br />Number of Transmissions High power: 158400 <br />High power temp (&deg;C): -20 to +60</p>
<p>The TAM-4xxx series utilizes a new hydrodynamic housing design. Data such as last dive time, dive count, maximum and average dive time, percentage of time spent under water and temperature can be transmitted. The TAM-4xxx series can also be configured with a pressure transducer. Depth of a dive, profile of a single dive and percentage of time in user defined depth layers are available. In addition to transmitting the data, they are also stored on board the unit in non-volatile memory. The TAM-4xxx series supports a highly compressed data transmission called page data. This series of units also support a VHF Tracking Beacon incorportated inside the housing. The VHF transmitter shares the transmitting antenna with the Argos transmitter. <br />Model TAM- 4410<br />Dimensions (in, cm): 4.65 X 2.56 X 1.26<br />11.8 x 6.5 x 3.2 <br />Unit Weight (g): 248<br />Onboard Memory for Data Logging: yes<br />Low power (mW): 400 (typ)<br />Number of Transmissions Low power: 155520 <br />Low power temp (&deg;C): -30 to +60 <br />High power (mW): 500 (Typ) <br />Number of Transmissions High power: 125280<br />High power temp (&deg;C): -30 to +60<br />Model TAM- 4510<br />Dimensions (in, cm): 5.91 x 2.87 x 1.54<br />15.0 x 7.3 x 3.9 <br />Unit Weight (g): 436<br />Onboard Memory for Data Logging: yes<br />Low power (mW): 400 (typ)<br />Number of Transmissions Low power: 377280<br />Low power temp (&deg;C): -30 to +60 <br />High power (mW): 500 (Typ) <br />Number of Transmissions High power: 308160<br />High power temp (&deg;C): -30 to +60<br />A micro-power saltwater switch (SWS) saves additional power and further extends the operational life of the unit. [ More information about saltwater switch: Show ] <br />Real-time clock calendar (RTC) controls all timing functions. <br />All products can be programmed by Telonics Product Programmer (TPP) which uses a GUI interface. TPP makes it possible for users to program their own systems and simulate performance of the system prior to deployment. On-board sensors can be activated or deactivated in the field. Data collection regimes and schedules can be altered as required. Sensor data can be enhanced or deleted from Argos uplink transmissions. Transmission schedules can be modified. Argos ID codes can be changed. Argos uplink transmission power levels can be modified to extend operational life or increase the probability of signal reception at the satellite. Argos uplink frequencies can be changed to frequencies in low noise channels to increase the chances of a successful uplink. <br />Powerful data collection and transfer capabilities allow the units to acquire, queue, and transmit temperatures and dive information. <br />Data Decoding - Data are processed using the Telonics Data Converter (TDC), which provides complete data decoding of Argos DS files and supports complete memory downloading. TDC provides a comma separated value (csv) output file with time stamps for all data collected. TDC can also be run in the "batch mode" for hands off operation. <br />TDC allows you to plot Argos locations with Google Earth. <br />Shutdown with a small magnet allows users to turn each of these configurations "on" or "off". When turned "off", TAM-26xx series based units consume less than 5 &micro;A, and TAM-4xxx series based units consume less than 12 &micro;A. Given these low current levels, users can store their units for extended periods with minimal impact on operational life. <br />Units can be refurbished to their original condition at the factory. <br />The number of transmissions is based on a continuous series of transmissions of a 4-byte Argos message at a 60-second repetition rate at 25&deg;C<br />Timing Accuracy: Timing is synchronized to GPS time when available. If the GPS time is not then internal timing accuracy is: 6 min/year at 25&deg; C; 30 min/yr -20 to +40&deg; C; 47 min/yr -40 to +70&deg; C<br />User programmable that allow for changes in duty cycle and data collected to be changed depending on species and area of deployment</p>
<p>The government knows of only one source Telonics Inc. who is capable of providing the TAM Argos Tags that would meet the government requirement. To be considered, firms must furnish detailed specifications of the TAM Argos Tags being offered and their capability to provide the product and satisfy or exceed the Government's needs. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for whom you have furnished this type of product previously, and detailed narrative that described your facility and ability to provide this product, along with the individual work knowledge and experience. Interested parties must respond within (5) days after publication of this notice. The government knows of only one source. The government invites firms that believe they have the capability to meet the requirement to response, providing specific information that will enable the government to determine whether or not to compete the requirement. Faxed information can be sent to 808-983-2900 or emailed to Bonnie.Oshiro@noaa.gov.</p>

<CONTACT>Pamela Franzel, Contracting Officer, Phone (703) 292-5398, Fax (703) 292-9140, Email pfranzel@nsf.gov
<DESC>Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC, Polar Services, (RPSC) is soliciting proposals towards securing a charter for a Research Vessel with Ice Breaking capability (RVIB) to operate in the Southern Oceans around Antarctica and other locations in support of the United States Antarctic Program (USAP).
<p>RPSC presently charters and provides science support staffing on the ARSV LAURENCE M. GOULD and the RVIB NATHANIEL B. PALMER for the National Science Foundation (NSF), an agency of the United States Government. On behalf of the NSF, RPSC is pursuing the charter of a vessel to meet the oceanographic and logistics support requirements of the USAP. The vessel is to be chartered for a period of five (5) years with options for up to another five (5) years. The purpose of this announcement is to seek interested parties in industry capable of supplying a vessel to continue to provide services currently supported by the RVIB NATHANIEL B. PALMER. RPSC will be seeking proposals that include the building of a new ship or the reconditioning and/or overhaul of an existing similar classed vessel.</p>
<p>The vessel will be required to operate frequently in the often extremely stormy waters south of Cape Horn in the Drake Passage with regular operations south of 60 degrees South Latitude and in sea ice to support oceanographic research and USAP logistics for Palmer Station and other field locations. The vessel must be seaworthy, fully found, appropriately classed, be able to provide a stable platform from which to conduct scientific research and comfortable enough to safely support personnel at sea for extended periods. Such remote operations necessarily require a reliable and well fitted vessel. Operations in support of scientific research will be the key evaluation criteria within the technical requirements of the Request for proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>To receive a full RFP package, please contact Jim Weber at RPSC below. Proposals are due to RPSC by 1 October, 2010 and should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC<br />Polar Services<br />7400 S. Tucson Way<br />Centennial, CO 80112-3938<br />Attn: Mr. Jim Weber<br />720-568-2343 Office<br />303-790-9129 Fax<br />James.weber.contractor@usap.gov</p>

<p><br />ENGINE OVERHAULS FOR NOAA DHC-6 TWIN OTTER AIRCRAFT</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>A.1 Background: The two PT6A-27 engines on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) DeHavilland Twin Otter, FAA registration N46RF will require overhaul due to approaching Time Between Overhaul (3600 Hours). The aircraft's primary mission, as an observation platform for marine mammals, requires low level operation over salt water. The average flight lasts for duration of five hours: hence the low engine cycles. The engine has been on the Trend Group/Dallas Airmotive, Turbine Engine Monitoring Program (TEMP) since the new engines were installed at aircraft total time 6,013.8. Oil samples were taken conditionally. The engines will be delivered to the overhaul facility in serviceable condition, or as removed from an airworthy aircraft. This work for the base period will be performed in the fall of 2010 timeframe. Pertinent information applicable to the engines as of March 22, 2010 is below. The aircraft is expected to arrive at the vendor's facility with not more than 3960 hours and 2000 cycles since the engines were installed. NOAA is looking at the overhaul of the two engines for aircraft N46RF as Task Order 1 to be issued under the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract.</p>

<p>All engine components were new at install.</p>
<p>SCOPE:</p>
<p>A. 2 The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, special tools and facilities to overhaul the Government's engines to a zero time since overhaul status. The overhauls shall be in accordance with the Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A-27overhaul manual. The contractor shall replace all parts recommended by the manufacturer to be replaced at each overhaul regardless of their apparent condition; this includes but is not limited to gaskets, packing rubber parts, lock washers, tab locks, etc. Only FAA approved parts are to be used. Parts Manufacturer Approved (PMA) parts are preferred. The Government and/or the contractor will remove the engines from the aircraft at a mutually agreed upon location. The Government may elect to have the contractor remove and re-install the engines at the contractor's overhaul facility or remove them at the Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Tampa, FL. The contractor overhauling the engine will be responsible for providing all shipping containers and payment of freight for the PT6A-27 engines and containers to and from the AOC if required. Once the engines have been shipped to the overhaul facility the contractor will provide within fifteen working days a cost estimate with timeline of repairs, and tear down inspection report that includes the extent of the inspections, condition of all major components, remaining routable life limits, outstanding service bulletins and airworthiness directives that must be complied with, and any recommendations for maintenance actions for the prevention of further expenses to the Government fleet. Once the overhaul is complete the contractor will run the engines on a test cell prior to re-installing on the aircraft. It is expected that the engines will be ready to reinstall on aircraft within ninety days. The Contractor shall be responsible for all FAA and AOC required documentation. Offerors must provide a firm fixed price for tear down inspection, overhaul with known replacement parts, and run on a test cell after the overhaul and prior to installation on the aircraft. The Government also needs to know the cost and availability of overhauled exchange engines and a factory new engine. A loaner engine may be needed for an estimated 200 hours during the overhaul period and should be quoted at an hourly rate and/or daily rate.</p>
<p>Any life limited part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an over and above. Since the government cannot determine which parts or components if any meet this criteria offerors are asked to provide what Labor rate they will charge the government per hour for over and above discrepancies. Secondly, offerors are asked to provide what percent discount off list price for replacement parts, both new and overhauled, will be charged. Parts Manufactured Approved (PMA) parts are acceptable.</p>
<p>Discrepancies (over and above repair items) on the aircraft may be identified during inspection. The Contractor will be responsible for documenting and reporting all over and above discrepancies to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR). The documentation must include:<br />&bull; Description of each discrepancy found<br />&bull; Number of man-hours per discipline required to complete each discrepancy<br />&bull; Hourly rate for personnel performing the work<br />&bull; Parts costs (Show list price minus appropriate discount percentage)<br />&bull; Total Dollar Amount for each discrepancy<br />&bull; Total Dollar Amount for complete list of discrepancies<br />The COR will be responsible for reviewing the list of discrepancies and making a recommendation to either accept or decline the Contractor's proposal. Additional work should not be performed on the aircraft without prior approval from the Contracting Officer (CO).<br />If the aircraft is to be repositioned for engine removal/exchange, the Contractor shall provide a full service, Fixed Base of Operations (FBO), which can support the DeHavilland Twin Otter PT6A-27 aircraft. Labor, materials, equipment, special tools and facilities shall be located at the FBO to provide the Government with the most cost effective support package. The Contract FBO shall provide flight crew amenities, scheduled and un-scheduled maintenance, inspection, and repair on an as-needed basis. The Contract FBO is a technical evaluation criteria listed in A.8. <br />The Government shall be responsible for scheduling all work against this Contract. Once work has been approved and the aircraft and/or engine arrives at the Contractor's facility, no work shall begin until the COR, or their designee, has given the approval for such work to begin. Only the work that is being requested shall be done. Any additional work or discrepancies must have prior approval from the CO.</p>
<p>During the term of this Contract, the Contractor may be required to subcontract portions of the inspection, maintenance, overhaul or repair work. In the event, such subcontracting becomes necessary, the Contractor shall notify the Government in advance of such subcontracting and provide the Government with the name, and any other requested information, of the proposed subcontractor. The Government reserves the right to initiate, and approve or disapprove, any subcontractor.<br />During the term of this Contract vendor will also be required to supply over the counter parts and labor support for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance events at various locations, this also includes vibration sweep, borescope inspections, trend monitoring analysis and engine rigging. Provide a point of contact to help in troubleshooting. These actions will be treated as over and above repair items.<br />The Contractor will be responsible for all FAA and AOC required documentation to include, but not limited to, approval for return to service.</p>
<p>A.3 Delivery Requirements: The engine to be overhauled may be delivered in two different ways. Either a Government flight crew will fly the aircraft to the Contractor's facility or an agreed upon location, as stipulated in A.2, for the engine removal/exchange or the engine will be removed at the AOC in Tampa, FL and shipped to the contractor's facility. The contractor overhauling the engine will be responsible for all shipping and payment of freight for the PT6A-27 engines to and from the AOC if required. A Task Order will be issued to the Contractor as soon as the need for service, inspection, and repair has been identified. The down time for this work should not exceed the pre-arranged timeframe for such repair. If requested, all scheduled events and required services will be brought to the Contractor's attention before award of the Task Order. Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government. The cost of shipping the returnables shall be the responsibility of the Government.</p>
<p>A.4 Quality Assurance: NOAA/AOC may desire to have a representative witness any part of the work performed under this Contract. The Contractor shall keep the COR apprised of the progress and schedule. Any repairs outside the scope of this Contract must be approved by the CO before repairs are started. NOAA shall have access to the aircraft throughout the term of this Contract. NOAA will provide an authorized AOC representative to be present for test flight and final acceptance. AOC pilots shall conduct the test flight.</p>
<p>A.5 Insurance Against Loss or Damage to Government Property: The contractor must provide, at its own expense, and maintain Hull &amp; Liability insurance in the amount of at least $3,000,000 if engines are to be changed at contractor's facilities or $250,000 coverage for engines during transit and the overhaul process. Before contract award the Contractor shall provide documentation to the Contracting Officer in writing that the required insurance has been obtained. The policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective:<br />&bull; For such a period as the laws of the State in which this work is to be performed prescribe; or <br />&bull; Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever is longer.</p>
<p><br />A.6 Parts, Discounts, and Warranties: The Contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables. However, the Government reserves the right to provide the same, if advantageous at any time during the Contract. The Government will make the final determination on whether new, new surplus, overhauled, repaired, or serviceable parts will be installed on the aircraft. Parts and components in an "as removed" status will not be installed on the aircraft. Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an over and above. The Contractor shall provide the industry standard implied warranty on all products and service.</p>
<p>A.7 FAA, OEM Certification and Minimum Contractor Requirements: The Contractor shall provide all special tools, facilities, equipment, and certified factory trained technical staffing to perform work under this Contract. Minimum requirements for consideration under this contract are listed below: <br />Minimum Contractor Requirements<br />&bull; Must provide evidence of having the ability to perform an overhaul of engines for a PT6A-27 engine, in accordance with the manufacturer's manual. <br />&bull; Must hold, maintain and submit a copy of FAA Repair Station Certificate covering the PT6A engines for the length of contract.<br />&bull; Must have Pratt &amp; Whitney factory trained technicians on staff.<br />&bull; Must be able to provide references of having performed work on the same model aircraft. Work performed within the past six months will receive more consideration than work performed longer than six months ago. (Reference to include: Company name, address, contact person's name and phone number, "N" number of the aircraft on which work was/is performed, nature of work completed, date of completion or status)<br />&bull; Must provide the number of non-overtime work shifts and total number of service hours available in a 24 hour period as well as the number of days of the week they are worked.<br />&bull; Must submit proof of insurance in accordance with requirements contained in paragraph A.5.<br />&bull; Must provide location of maintenance facility.</p>
<p>A.8. Technical Evaluation<br />Contractors must first meet the above minimum criteria and will be evaluated on the following</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Factors:<br />1. Past performance.<br />2. Demonstrated experience in performing an overhaul of engines for a PT6A-27 engine, in accordance with the manufacturer's manual.<br />3. Number of factory Pratt and Whiney trained technicians on staff.<br />4. Experience of Key Personnel (i.e. Service Manager, Lead Technician, Contract Administrator) and their ability to work with the COR and CO.<br />5. Discounted percentage off of list price of parts.<br />6. Location of Contractor's facility.<br />7. Location of FBO.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important than price. As the technical ratings become more equal, price becomes more important. Conversely, as price proposals become more equal to one another, technical proposals will become a more important determining factor.</p>
<p>This is a best value, competitive RFQ. Award will be made to the offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation requirements, which is determined responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) by possessing the financial and other capabilities to fulfill the requirements of the Contract; and whose proposal is judged, by an integrated assessment of price and other evaluation factors listed above, to be the most advantageous to the Government. The Government intends to award a single contract from this solicitation. The Government reserves the right not to award a contract depending on the quality of the proposal(s) submitted and the availability of funds. The Government reserves the right to award without discussion based solely upon the initial proposals.</p>
<p>A.8 Submittal of Invoices: (EAD-KC OFFICE ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-4(g))<br />The Contractor shall prepare and submit invoices to the Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) using the address shown in Block 15 of the Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items-Standard Form 1449. All invoices shall be based on work completed as of the end of the Contractor's most recent billing period and shall be submitted to AOC by the 10th day of the subsequent month.</p>
<p>For each Task Order, the Contractor shall be required to fax a bi-weekly financial progress report/partial invoice on all expenditures that will be invoiced to the Government. This report may not be the final invoice. However, the format may be the same. Partial invoices will only be processed after COR and CO acceptance.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation number is HSCG85-10-Q-P45UH1 is issued as a Request for Quotations. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Quotation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-42. This solicitation is a total small business set-aside.&nbsp;The NAICS Code is 488310The small business size standard is $25.5 million. The contract will be awarded on a firm-fixed-price basis using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.
<p>The requirement is for tug and fender services for CGC SHERMAN.</p>
<p>Current Condition: 3 Coast Guard High Endurance Cutters are moored abreast at Coast Guard Island Pier, Alameda, CA. The current fenders separating the cutters are too small for the Navy dive team to properly inspect the hull of CGC SHERMAN, which is the middle of the 3 cutters.</p>
<p>Cutter Specifications: Each cutter is 378ft long, has a beam of 42ft, approximate displacement of 3,200LT, and max draft of 16ft.</p>
<p>Scope of work: Provide four (4) large fenders, approximately 4ft in diameter, to be used for a period of 10 days. Sufficient tug services would be needed to maneuver CGC SHERMAN and CGC BOUTWELL (cutter furthest outboard) so that the 4 larger fenders could be placed to replace the existing smaller fenders, 2 on SHERMAN's port side and 2 on the starboard side, and then to remove them after the 10 day period. There is a whisper wave barrier that separates the cutters from the channel that needs to be de-attached and re-attached in order to get to the cutters. The cutters will provide sufficient line handlers to help in the evolution. None of the cutters will have propulsion equipment running.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: 11 - 21 AUGUST 2010</p>
<p>Place of Performance: Coast Guard Island, Alameda, CA</p>

<p>Notice for Filing Agency Protests - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>
