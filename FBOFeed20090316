<DESC><p>The 6th Contracting Squadron will be soliciting a 100% small business set-aside, competitive Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build construction efforts to support the 6th CES mission at MacDill AFB and Avon Park, Florida. This acquisition will encompass requirements that have, in the past, been acquired utilizing the Base Engineering Support contractor. Individual task order work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task order limits will be $2,000 to $5,000,000. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed $150M over a seven-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and six 12-month option periods.<br />.<br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $31M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $31M. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement and removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, painting, roofing and paving. Locations of work will be at MacDill AFB, and Avon Park Range, FL. Offers are solicited only from business concerns who are current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan.
<p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3, and AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, targeted toward competitive offerors with a 45-day response time (offers due 45 days after issuing). In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to six (6) contracts to small businesses, who give the Air Force the greatest confidence that they can meet our requirements for up to 100% design and construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, and/or airfield work. The solicitation will include a design/build seed project that will be used to evaluate these capabilities. The seed project is to Repair Hangar 2 Sanitary Sewer System and Bathrooms. The seed project magnitude is between $500,000 to $1,000,000.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. MacDill AFB plans to include the following factors and sub-factors: 1) Mission Capability, 2) Proposal risk; 3) Past Performance; and 4) Pricing. Within the Mission Capability Factor the following 4 sub-factors will be used: a) Organizational Structure b) Technical Capability/Execution and Completeness of the Seed Project c) Change and Cost Control Management, and d) Quality Control Procedures. Mission Capability, Proposal Risk, and Past Performance Factors are considered equal in importance. The sub-factors within Mission Capability are also considered equal in importance. Combined, all three factors are significantly more important than cost or price. Cost/Price, however, will contribute substantially to the selection decision and will be assessed for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Up to six (6) highest rated offerors from the source selection will receive basic contract award. The highest rated offeror will be awarded the seed project.<br />All future task orders will be competed among all the contract awardees. All contractors receiving award will receive a not-to-exceed $2,000 task order for the MACC Orientation Seminar to satisfy the contract minimum requirement.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 27 Feb 2009 and close on or about 45 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the CCR database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>

<DESC>EXPRESSION OF INTEREST

Requirement: 

The United States Government Farm Service Agency currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Ottawa, Ohio located at 240 Lake Street, Oak Harbor, Ohio, that will be expiring October 30, 2009. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 2,988 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 2,864 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy by October 31, 2009. The delineated area is North bounded by: SR 2; East bounded by: SR 19; South bounded by: Portage River; West bounded by: SR 590. 

Other applicable requirements include: 

 Parking: 25 on site paved parking spaces. 

 Others. 

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

Changing to another product of similar hardware specifications will put the Department at risk due to documentation, integration, configuration and installation process change requirements.  GITM Procurement requests that the equipment listed be procured on a brand name only basis.  A Brand Name (Limited Source) only acquisition is permitted when justified as essential to meeting the Government Requirements by FAR 11.105.  As this is a Brand Name (Limited Source) only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as teh basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system.  Although the requirement is restricted to brand name only, AQM will post the requirement on FedBid and will include the brand name justification with the posting.  The requirement will be competed on FedBid amongst Federal Supply Schedule Holders in compliance with FAR 8.405-6.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a market survey for Contract Tower and Weather Observation Group (CTWG).  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  Vendors who responded to posting ID 7328 and 7405, need not respond to this market survey.
The FAA has a five-year requirement for the continuation of Air Traffic Control (ATC) services at Visual Flight Rules Airports throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and Saipan.  Attachment A is the draft Statement of Work for this requirement.  As of October 1, 2008, ATC services are being provided at 241 air traffic control towers by four vendors: Robinson Aviation Inc., Midwest Air Traffic Control Service, Inc., Serco Management Services, Inc, and Air Services Pacific.  Attachments B and C are a list of those locations presently covered by the FCT program.  The FAA plans to release a SIR/RFP to industry during the second quarter of Calendar Year 2009.  It is planned that the FCT contracts be awarded in time for contract performance to begin Oct. 1, 2009.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.  At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing ATC Services at Visual Flight Rules Airports.  This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 4881111, Air Traffic Control, with a size standard of $7.0M.  Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form, Attachment D, and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:
a. A minimum of three years experience as an operating business entity.
b. A minimum of three years experience in providing administrative and operational support to personnel working at geographically separated locations.
c. Ability to cover payroll and other operating and administrative expenses to accommodate Government "in arrears" payments for work performed for periods up to ninety days.  The amount of money required to cover expenses needs to be sufficient enough to cover the top two areas (i.e. the highest proposed total dollar amount for the Part I CLINS) that the offeror is bidding on.
d. Must have a minimum of three years experience providing air traffic control services.
e. Resident experience with safety risk management processes contained within the company.
f. Must have adequate financial resources to perform the contract or the ability to obtain them.
g. Must demonstrate by example experience in delivering quality technical air traffic control services as provided in the SOW.
2.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
All responses to this market survey must be received no later than noon (ET) March 24, 2009.   All submittals should be submitted to:

<CONTACT>Tonya R Rymer, Phone 907-228-6244, Email trymer@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to make notice that the Forest Service contemplates releasing a solicitation numbered AG-0116-S-09-0029 on or about March 30, 2009, for the ISO Helicopter Use project.  If the solicitation is released, it will be released through this FedBizOpps website, and prospective bidders should visit this FedBizOpps website from time to time on or after March 30, 2009, to obtain a copy of the solicitation.  This notice meets the requirements of FAR 5.201.  However, the Forest Service reserves the right not to release a solicitation.
 
NOTE REGARDING FEDBIZOPPS LISTINGS. The FedBizOpps website has three separate listings for the Forest Service in Alaska. These are (1) R-10 Alaska Region, Juneau, AK; (2) R-10 Chugach National Forest, Anchorage, AK; and (3) R-10 Tongass National Forest, Ketchikan, AK.  Prospective bidders are advised that these three listings are not purely geographic and that a requirement on either the Chugach (Anchorage) or Tongass (Ketchikan) National Forest may be posted under the Regional Office (Juneau) listing.  Thus, prospective bidders seeking Forest Service opportunities in Alaska should visit both the appropriate Forest listing (Anchorage or Ketchikan) as well as the Regional listing (Juneau).  The solicitation contemplated by this notice will appear under the Ketchikan listing. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION. This project consists of furnishing flight services, fully contractor operated and maintained, under the direction and control of the Forest Service.  The need consists of one Type III, singe engine, 4-7 passenger, pop-out float equipped helicopter.  The Forest Service anticipates locating the base in Juneau, Alaska.  Temporary alternate bases throughout Southeast and Southcentral Alaska may be assigned.  The mandatory availability period of performance is June 15 through September 15.

The helicopter will be used in the maintenance of mountain-top radio repeater sites on the Tongass and Chugach National Forests in Southeast and South-central Alaska.  Typical repeater site would require a pinnacle approach to a peak as high as 5,500 feet MSL.  It may also be used occasionally for the administration and protection of Public Lands.

<DESC>Background

The Archival Research Catalog (ARC) is NARA's centralized system for describing materials held throughout the agency's nationwide system of archival repositories.  ARC is composed of two subsystems: ARC Client/Server (C/S), which is the data entry system accessible only to NARA staff and approved contractors, and ARC Web, which is the public read-only version of the data entered and maintained in ARC C/S.  

As an integrated system, ARC enables NARA staff to intellectually describe and control archival holdings at appropriate descriptive levels for all media.  As NARAs primary, centralized data discovery tool, ARC ensures internal and external users are able to discover information about NARA's holdings through keyword searching, as well as by provenance and other access points that are controlled by the ARC authority files.  Through the implementation and quality control of uniform data standards, NARA staff are able to efficiently describe holdings in ARC, and public users are ensured consistent, relevant data retrieval and are able to determine the scope and location of NARA's holdings.  The number of links to online digital copies of NARA holdings in ARC, as well as electronic records maintained in the Access to Archival Databases (AAD) system, are increasing at a greater and greater rate.  With the number of electronically available records growing at an exponential rate, ARC no longer simply provides information about holdings, but increasingly provides direct access to the holdings themselves.

ARC C/S was developed by customizing a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product known as OLIB to meet NARAs requirements.  The system was customized by Fretwell Downing Informatics (FDI), which is now part of OCLC.  ARC C/S was launched in production in 2003 and has received several software application upgrades to correct system deficiencies and provide enhancements to meet the continuing descriptive needs of NARA staff.  ARC C/S now supports more than 500 end users.  The production architecture consists of a primary, standby and training server, all SUN V-440s, running Oracle 10g Enterprise Edition and Solaris 10.  Failover between the primary and standby servers is configured using Oracles DataGuard.  Remote user access to the ARC C/S servers is accomplished by load balancing users among five Windows 2003 Terminal Servers.

ARC Web was initially launched in 2002 and was re-engineered in 2008.  The production architecture consists of three load balanced SUN V20Z web servers which connect to an Oracle RAC instance running on three Sun V-440 database servers.  The data transfer process, which transfers new and updated descriptions from ARC C/S to ARC Web, and can run in full and update transfer mode, is accomplished using a Sun V-440 indexing server running a Sunopsis ETL tool.

In addition to the two major components of ARC (C/S and Web), there are two standalone tools to allow for the bulk import and approval of archival descriptions:

ARC Import Tool: allows ARC staff to upload item and file unit descriptions from non-standard, legacy finding aids and from NARAs digitizing partners.  This tool requires that ARC staff first format the data into a standard XML format.  Currently, the descriptions are imported as draft descriptions that must be approved prior to publication in ARC Web.

ARC Synchronization Tool: allows ARC staff to approve/synchronize the imported archival descriptions so that they can be transferred to ARC Web.  This tool was developed so that staff no longer needed to manually approve individual or small batches of uploaded archival descriptions.  However, it still takes about 1 system hour to approve/synchronize 10,000 descriptions for ARC Web publication.

The ARC C/S physical data model and source code, as well as the data transfer code, are proprietary to and remain the property of OCLC.  NARA owns the ARC Web searching and display source code.

As mentioned above, ARC maintains information about and links to digitized holdings that are maintained either on NARA media servers or are maintained by NARA's digitizing partners.  There are currently 147,433 digital copies available in ARC.  ARC also supports linking to several object data types, including:

Statement of Need

The existing ARC C/S system has enabled NARA to add more than 2.5 million archival descriptions and to make those descriptions available to the public via the ARC Web system.  However, the existing system lacks the scalability necessary to support the millions of archival descriptions that are resulting from NARAs digitizing partnerships.  Due to the rapid processing pace of NARAs digitizing partners, theres already a backlog of several million descriptions that will be associated with 11 million digital copies, and 30 million more digital copies expected to be delivered this year.  NARA is unable to import the corresponding archival descriptions into ARC C/S because of the impact it will have on the following:

1.	The amount of time it takes to complete a full data transfer from ARC C/S to ARC Web will increase substantially.  A full transfer of 2,478,259 archival descriptions currently takes 72 hours to complete.  It is predicted that the full transfer will take 240 hours to complete against a dataset of 11,000,000 records.
2.	The time window for copying data from the C/S system to the Intermediate Web database will increase. Currently this is taking 2 hours and its possible it would take up to 10 hours with a dataset of 11,000,000 records.  This will affect both the full and update data transfer processes and will impact the amount of off-hour system processing time available to run backups, conduct a nightly re-indexing job and to accommodate update and full data transfers.
3.	The addition of 11,000,000 archival descriptions could impact C/S system performance (i.e., searches, moving between data entry tabs in data entry layouts, etc.)

NARA has outgrown the existing ARC system and requires a more robust solution thats capable of scaling to support at least 250 million archival descriptions and links to upwards of 500 million digital copies over the next 4-7 years. 

Description:

NARA is exploring approaches to developing descriptive and authority services to replace the existing ARC C/S system and data transfer processes.  Services are pieces of business software that are constructed and interoperate in a specific manner.  They are collections of software components that have industry-standard Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and perform a discrete business function.  At execution time, services are accessed and operate across application boundaries (or even across organizations) in the context of an SOA, preferably leveraging Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) infrastructure to assure the quality and reliability of the software.  

Because services are potentially used across a wide range of applications and environments, they must assure semantically consistent business identity and completeness for the functionality they encapsulate.  A service is not intended to be a complete business application or business transaction, but rather a piece of business functionality that is designed to be reused in multiple business contexts and participate with other services and applications to support business functional requirements.  NARA will provide all pertinent business process descriptions to vendors, but will hold vendors architects responsible for understanding service requirements and making service granularity decisions based on a set of well understood design criteria (vendor defined and NARA approved).

Service development is predicated upon the concept of a multi-tier software architecture that separates business logic from presentation and data management logic, and then packages the business logic such that it is externally accessible via a well-defined interface.  This approach allows for loose coupling of application functionality that can be synchronously or asynchronously invoked based upon the needs of the application and the capabilities of the supporting software infrastructure. Figure 1 below provides a conceptual overview of the Description and Authority Services concept.  See NARAs Technical Reference Model (Appendix A) for detailed descriptions of the concepts of software modularity, coupling, cohesion, and interface invocation. 

VENDOR DAY APRIL 6, 2009

NARA will hold a Vendor Day on April 6, 2009 from 9:30 am to 3:00 pm at Archives II (8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD  20740).  The Vendor Day is for the purposes of demonstrating the system and answering vendor questions prior to firms submitting their RFI responses.  Firms that would like to attend Vendor Day should RSVP no later than COB March 30, 2009 to the Contracting Officer Anne Hasselbrack at anne.hasselbrack@nara.gov with the subject: VENDOR DAY.  

	Please provide the Business Name, Business Size per NAICS 541512, Persons Name, email and phone number for no more than TWO ATTENDEES per firm.   

NARA will email all firms by April 3, 2009 with logistics information concerning their attendance.  

Response Instructions

This RFI is for NARAs planning purposes only, and implies no commitment on NARAs part to acquire any products or services, or to adhere to a particular acquisition strategy should we in fact go forth with an acquisition.  NARA does not intend to technically evaluate responses for purposes of later excluding interested parties (such as a downselect), except in the case of a decision to restrict participation to only certain socio-economic classes; no formal evaluation will occur.  NARA will not reimburse any costs associated with vendors responses.  
   
Any firm (including those that were unable to attend Vendor Day) that wishes to submit a response may do so by 5:00 PM April 24, 2009 to the Contracting Officer Anne Hasselbrack, at anne.hasselbrack@nara.gov with a subject of:  "NARA Descriptive and Authority Services Response". 

NARA is seeking responses from vendors capable of providing a total solution.  Responses shall be no more than 25 pages, and include:

	Full contact information including business size for NAICS 541512 and socio-economic status
	Approach or solution to developing discrete descriptive and authority services designed to be reused in multiple business contexts and participate with other services and applications to support business functional requirements.  The descriptive and authority services will need to participate with the following NARA applications:
a.	Electronic Records Archives system (ERA)
b.	Holdings Management System (HMS)
c.	Online Public Access (OPA)
d.	ARC Web
ARC Web is online at http://arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/BasicSearchForm

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Johns Hopkins University. The Pediatrics and Developmental Neurosciences (PDN) Branch is involved in a large phenomenological study focusing on the interrelationship between regression in autism and immune dysfunction. NIMH propose to conduct a longitudinal natural history study of 50 children with autism and strictly defined regression, 50 children with autism and no history of regression, 50 typically developing children, and 25 children who meet criteria for Retts Disorder (a genetic disorder in which children have autistic features with clear regression). Subjects will be 12 to 48 months of age at study entry in order to capture regression as close to its onset as possible. Systematic prospective evaluations will be utilized in order to provide validation to the phenomenon of regression in autism, determine diagnostic and functional outcomes, and evaluate behavioral, medical and immunologic functioning. The period of performance: June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010 with one option year.

1. To characterize and validate the regressive phenotype in children with autism. 

2. To characterize the immune response in children with autism.
a. Distinct immunologic responses and cytokines abnormalities will be evident in children in the regressive autism sample, but not in the non-regressive autism, Retts Disorder, or typically developing samples.

3. To identify neurobiologic markers for autism through the techniques of metabolomics, proteomics and genomics (e.g. gene expression profiles). 

In addition, based on evidence of a pro-inflammatory profile seen in autism from the lab of Dr. Carlos Pardo. NIMH have designed a treatment trial using the anti-inflammatory properties of minocycline. Efficacy will be tested by examining the cytokine and chemokine profiles of serum and cerebrospinal fliud (CSF) before and after treatment.

Dr. Pardo and the Neuriommunology Laboratory at Johns Hopkins have pioneered this line of investigation in autism. No other laboratory is doing these types of analysis on CSF in autism. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI976308 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892-2080, and Attention: Kathleen Gregory, Contract Specialist.

I)   SUMMARY
The Critical Ecosystem Studies Initiative (CESI) is a science program managed by Everglades National Park.  CESI was established in 1997 to fund science activities and projects that help Department of Interior managers, including National Park Services, make decisions about how to move forward with Everglades restoration. Since 1997, more than 250 separate projects have been selected and funded by CESI.  
Information about the CESI program can be found on http://www.nps.gov/ever/naturescience/cesi.htm.  Important guidelines for applicants related to permitting and compliance can be found on the South Florida Natural Resources Center website, http://www.nps.gov/ever/naturescience/sfnrc.htm.
This BAA is administered following the limitations and requirements of the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR), Part 35 -Research and Development Contracting.  For detailed information, please see http://www.arnet.gov/far/.
Successful proposals will:"	Be complementary to ongoing work"	address overall priority science DOI need"	define deliverables that include"	progress reports"	a technical final report, and "	summary fact sheet prepared for presentation of the project on the SFNRC/CESI website.
II. PRIORITY SCIENCE NEEDS 
Proposals are requested that are oriented toward addressing the science needs listed in this section.  Please note that some of these science needs are fairly specific, and others are more general.  By use of a BAA, CESI anticipates the submission of meaningful proposals with varying technical/scientific approaches.    
For background on DOI science needs listed in this BAA, the following reference information is provided:"	The DOI Science Plan in Support of Ecosystem Restoration, Preservation, and Protection in South Florida, May 2005 (DOI Science Plan).   is available online and can be downloaded athttp://www.sofia.usgs.gov/publications/reports/doi-science-plan/.  It is recommended that the "What is needed" sections in each chapter are reviewed before submitting to this BAA.  Please send all questions and comments to the contact person listed in this BAA, who will forward your inquiries to the CESI Project Management Specialist.
"	An overview of Everglades restoration issues, including the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), Acceler-8 (8 CERP projects on an accelerated schedule), CERP Interim Goals and RECOVER, may be viewed at   http://www.evergladesplan.org/ .  RECOVER and the Monitoring and Assessment Plan can be found at http://www.evergladesplan.org/pm/recover/recover.cfm.  Interagency science priorities can be reviewed at http://www.sfrestore.org.  Information about the hydrologic models developed by the South Florida Water Management District can be found at http://www.sfwmd.gov/org/pld/hsm/hsm.html/ .  

A. Hydrologic and Ecological Modeling:  Tool DevelopmentWork is needed on modeling of surface water and ground water dynamics to simulate the impact of projects on water patterns, water quality, and ecology in the following areas:  Biscayne National Park and associated basins and upstream systems; the eastern border of the Water Conservation Areas and Everglades National Park; Northeast and Central Florida Bay; Picayune Strand and Ten-Thousand Islands area of SW coastal areas; and A.R.M. Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge.  Refinement of existing models will, in general, be given priority over new model development.  Models and project effects simulated may be of the scale of planned pre-CERP and CERP hydrologic restoration projects, or may be of a more local scale so as to capture effects of, for example, localized operational deviations, quarries, or species with localized ranges. 
We expect fund 2-3 projects in this area for 3 years.

B. Water Management Operations and Climatic Variability:  ApplicationsResearch is needed that assists in determining the effects of water management operations (e.g. structure discharge, canal stages, and operating plans such as Regulation Schedule[s], Rainfall Plans, Marsh Operations, and Minimum Deliveries)  and climate variability (inter-annual variability in rainfall, hurricane frequency, drought frequency), on biological resources including community composition and function in the following areas: "	Ridge and slough"	Tree islands"	Florida Bay and Biscayne Bay"	Picayune Strand restoration project watershedThis research may utilize existing or new field information, and/or modeling tools.  CERP and pre-CERP projects that are of most interest in the context of this science need are the Modified Water Deliveries project and the C111 South Dade project, the WCA3A Decompartmentalization project, the C111 Spreader Canal project, and the ENP seepage management project.
We expect to fund 2-4 projects in this area for 3 years.

C. Climate Change and Sea Level RiseWe require studies that address the impacts of climate change and sea level rise on DOI trust resources in the South Florida ecosystem, in the context of Everglades restoration.  Some questions that are pertinent to management decision-making, and that should be considered in the development of proposals are: "	What are the predicted effects of sea-level rise on coastal ecosystems in South Florida (including the natural and built system), and how do these effects relate to restoration activities?  We are looking for refinement and applications of tools (including existing models, and remote imagery) that provide quantitative landscape-scale assessments of surface water distribution, vegetation type, critical habitat status, and estuarine conditions. "	Can increased freshwater flow ameliorate the effects of sea level rise in South Florida built and natural systems, and to what extent?  "	What is the status of coastal ecosystems/coastal communities/coastal species within the DOI trust resources of South Florida?  The focus should be on ecosystems that are affected both by sea level rise/climate change and by Everglades restoration activities. "	What are the best (i.e. the most parsimonious suite of) physical or ecological indicators to monitor that track the effects of climate change and sea level rise on DOI trust resources in South Florida?  Indicators that are tracked by other State and Federal agencies should be distinguished from those that should be tracked by DOI.
We expect to fund 1-5 projects in this area for 3 years.

D. Invasive Exotic Organisms (both Plant and Animal)  We require studies that provide information on the impact, prevention, management and control of invasive exotic organisms within federally managed areas.  Management questions that should be addressed in proposals are the following:"	What are the best systems for early detection of and rapid response to incipient populations of non-native invasive animals and plants in the South Florida Ecosystem, particularly those that pose a threat to DOI resources?"	How can managers predict which non-native invasive animals (particularly fish and reptiles) currently in the South Florida system pose the greatest risk of invasion and/or impact to communities of native species? (predictive risk-assessment studies)"	What are the best alternative structural designs to use in pre-CERP or CERP projects that would prevent or limit the spread of non-native species?"	What are the impacts to and responses of native animals to introduction and persistence of exotic organisms in terrestrial and aquatic environments in federally managed areas?
We expect to fund 2-5 projects in this area for 3 years.

E. Avian Ecology and Multi-species ManagementSnail Kites:  Work is needed to integrate research on habitat quality, apple snail reproduction and availability, and population parameters of the snail kite in South Florida.  The outcome of this work should be an "integrated suite of recommendations that identifies the range of acceptable water management strategies and expected outcomes [for the Snail Kite], with respect to their short term and long term effects on the status of the vegetation communities, Apple Snails and Snail Kites, and their interactions." (SEI report, 2007, www.sei.org .)  
We expect to fund 1-2 projects in this area for 3 years.

F. A Synthesis of Freshwater Everglades Research  A synthesis of field data, historical information and modeling results of the last 1-2 decades of intensive Everglades freshwater research is needed.  This synthesis should review the literature for emerging scientific results that are pertinent to the refinement of long-term restoration goals and targets in South Florida, and to the design of restoration projects to move toward those goals.  Identification of gaps in scientific knowledge should also result from this work.  The synthesis should focus on the Everglades freshwater ecosystem from Lake Okeechobee southward, and include such topics as hydrology and water flow patterns, water quality, sediment transport, vegetative habitats (tree islands, ridge and slough, marsh, wet prairie), and ecological communities.  
A book or a dedicated journal issue is envisioned as the result of this work.  The resulting work should provide resource managers with information for decision-making.  For example, a synthesis of water quality research might include a review of how nutrients in the water column as compared to the effects of local or regional dry downs affect the trajectory and timeframe of ecosystem restoration upon re-hydration.  
We expect to fund 1 project in this area for 3 years.

III)     BAA OBJECTIVES
A)	The long-term objective of the DOI science initiative is to provide support to initiate and accelerate research for critical science in support of the Greater Everglades ecosystem restoration initiative.
B)	The program is designed to complement the research endeavors of other DOI agencies and stakeholder institutions involved in Everglades restoration by filling in the gaps in our current understanding of restoration science and is coordinated with those entities to avoid duplication of efforts.
IV) PROGRAM AUTHORITY AND FUNDING AVAILABILITY

The analyzer must display a constant LED display monitor to keep the users continually informed of minute changes and provides the operator the opportunity to make adjustments.  5.The unit must be equipped with a re-circulating atmospheric HEPA filtration system that filters the chamber atmosphere and controls contamination by particles 0.3 micron and larger.  It must be capable of drawing internal atmosphere out of the chamber, through the external filter and back into the chamber.  6.The unit must have automatic airlocks that are equipped with an advanced electronic program that allows adjustments in number of cycles (a multiple vacuum/purge procedure), calibration of pressure sensors, and programmable profiles, depending on the type of work done in the chamber.  7.The unit must be equipped with a gas injection system that injects the hydrogen gas mix into the chamber on a fixed time schedule for a fixed time period, allowing users to leave the chamber unattended for days at a time. 
8.The chamber must be equipped with large capacity automatic dehumidifier to condense moisture and drain the excess moisture to outside from the chamber without using a desiccant.  	Specifically, a quote is requested for an anaerobic chamber.  The response shall be delivered within 30 days of award of a purchase order in an electronic format.  The electronic documents shall be Section 508 Compliant (http://www.access-board.gov).

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), 500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001 for a "Report on the Effect of Climate Change on Indoor Air Quality." 
The circumstances permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements."  
The EPA requires the services of the NAS Institute of Medicine to conduct an analysis, and develop and publish an authoritative, comprehensive report that investigates and examines the scientific issues related to indoor environments and climate change.  The report: (1) will summarize the state of scientific understanding of the significance of climate change on Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), indoor environments, and public health; (2) will be accepted as credible and unbiased by the scientific community, the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government, state and local governments, private industry, and the public and that can serve as a foundation for the development of U.S. domestic and foreign policies and priorities; (3) can be cited and used by IAQ and building science communities, etc.; and (4) will analyze and document the connections in the scientific literature on IAQ and climate change.  
Upon completion of the expert panel's report, the report undergoes a management review, to ensure that the charge questions have been addressed, and a scientific peer review, to ensure that the conclusions are supported and represent the state of the scientific understanding, all within the NAS.  The final independent report is then presented to the sponsors, Congress, and the public simultaneously.  
NAS was congressionally chartered in 1863 to provide advice to the federal government on scientific and technical matters. The NAS is the definitive, unbiased voice of the scientific community in the United States.  It?s uniqueness in this role stems not only from its congressional charter, but also from its reputation and from the manner in which it carries out its studies.   Executive Order 12832 recognizes the unique qualifications of the NAS and explicitly authorizes sole-source procurement when the Government determines that NAS is the only source that can provide the necessary expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance.  Based on the above, the EPA believes that the NAS is the only vendor capable of satisfying the Agency's requirements.  
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Any response(s) failing to provide a capability statement but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will not be honored.  Interested parties may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement within 15 days of the date of this announcement to Lanelle T. Shands, at shands.lanelle@epa.gov.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  
Interested vendors shall:  1) include information on the proposed services/equipment which clearly supports the requirements outlined above; 2) fully explain your capabilities and qualifications and; 3) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  Response to this synopsis must be made in writing.  No telephone or fax requests will be honored.

<DESC>SSA intends to establish a Firm Fixed price contract for the purchase of  upgrading and procuring two Social Security Number (SSN) card printers with the option of two additional printers.  SSA issues these SSN cards, including a unique 9-digit number and the full name, to citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents, as codified in the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.  405(c)(2).  SSA is currently utilizing two IBM 6262 impact printers to produce 80,000 SSN cards per day across multiple shifts.  These printers are dated technology with high maintenance cost, hard to find replacement parts and pose an increased risk of disruption to SSAs card production workload.  With the number of printed cards expected to increase, the need to develop an alternative commercially available solution is imperative to ensure stability, security and high availability of SSAs SSN card print technology.  The contract will encompass a base year with four option years to provide for maintenance after the warranty expires.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Currently, the Active Transmit Subsystem isinstalled on the USNS IMPECCABLE (T-23) Surveillance Towed Array SensorSystem (SURTASS) Low Frequency Active (LFA) platform.  In addition, theCompact Low Frequency Active Transmit Subsystem (CLFA) is aboard the USNSABLE (T-20) SURTASS platform.  These systems were procured from BAESystems of Nashua, NH who is the single source of expertise for this uniquetechnology.
Once integrated with the platform, system verification testing of CLFA revealedthe need for some minor design revisions and additional testing.  The effort tobe contracted includes these design revisions and an extended testing effort.The proposed contract action would not exceed 6,000 staff hours ofengineering services in the years FY09 and FY10.
The Government believes that BAE Systems of Nashua, NH with their previousrequisite knowledge, technical expertise, and existing extensive facilitieswithCLFA is the only contractor that can accomplish these requirements to provideat-ship support, engineering studies, maintenance support, drawing support,maintenance manual support, training support, and program managementsupport for the operational LFA and CLFA in the fleet for PMS 485.  BAESystems of Nashua, NH is the only contractor that can accomplish theserequirements without substantial duplication of cost that would not be expectedto be recovered thru competition and without unacceptable delays.  Authorityfor other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services willsatisfy agency requirements.
It is anticipated this Task Order on contract number N66001-06-D-0037 will beimplemented in April 2009.

<DESC>The US Army Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition Systems (OPM-MAS), intends to solicit under full and open competition a requirement for the development and production of the Cartridge, 120mm, Advanced Kinetic Energy (M829E4) Armor Piercing, Fin Stabilized, Discarding Sabot with Tracer (AKE (M829E4) APFSDS-T) for FY10-FY14.  This cartridge is a kinetic energy (KE) round with a depleted uranium (DU) penetrator. The AKE (M829E4) is the next generation Line of Sight (LOS) KE round being developed for the Future Combat System Mounted Combat System (FCS MCS) and the Abrams Main Battle Tank (MBT).  The manufacture of the DU penetrator is restricted to the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB) under authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(3), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3.  
The anticipated procurement will be for a CPFF base contract for the Engineering, Manufacture and Development (EMD) Phase I, a CPIF Option 1 for EMD Phase II, FFP Option 2 with NTE prices for Low Rate Initial Production of 800 +/- 20% cartridges, and FFP Option 3 and Option 4 with NTE prices for 2 years of Full Rate Production of approximately 4,200 +/- 20% cartridges per production year with deliveries beginning in FY14.  
The Government anticipates initial contract award of Phase I to two separate, competing offerors.  Contract award of EMD Phase I will follow a formal source selection process.  Following a timeframe of approximately 10-13 months from award of EMD Phase I, Phase I awardees will provide the Government updated proposals for consideration in a downselect to a single EMD contract basedupon a best value decision for the Government.  Results of a ballistic demonstration test and shoot-off, to be performed at around 14 months after contract award, will also be used in consideration of downselect.  This strategy is planned but not guaranteed.

A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued within two (2) weeks of this notice allowing bidders to review and submit questions/concerns to be addressed at Industry Day.  Approximately 45 days after Industry Day, the official RFP will be released.  Contractors will then be given approximately 45 days to respond to the final RFP.
Also, the US Army Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ will be hosting an Industry Day on 16 April 2009 between the hours of 0900 and 1100.  The Industry Day will be held at a location TBD at Picatinny Arsenal.  This event is being held to discuss the AKE (M829E4)cartridge draft solicitation.  In addition to the Open Session, prospectiveofferors may request a one-on-one session, lasting no more than 1.5 hours and starting at 1300 hours.  This will be scheduled on a first come, first served basis.  There will be two sessions on 16 April and as necessary, 17 April. Please contact the Contract Specialist by April 7.  Each contractor shouldidentify who will be attending both/either sessions to allow for security tobe notified and sufficient seating arrangements to be arranged.

<DESC>THIS IS AN INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT PURSUANT TO FAR 6.302-1.  NOOTHER NOTICE OR SOLICITATION SHALL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE.

The comprehensive information about individual and household income and program participation collected by the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is used by federal agencies to evaluate programs and assess need.  A major use of the SIPP has been to evaluate the effectiveness of government programs and to analyze the impact of options for modifying them. The SIPPs longitudinal design has many advantages, but imposes considerable burden on data users to efficiently exploit its potential.  Reducing SIPP data users burden, and overcoming obstacles inherent in the SIPPs design is a key component in improving customer service.  Data from the multiple panels and waves of SIPP are documented in more than 200 data dictionaries, many similar to one another, and some identical.  The user of these files does not have any way of knowing which elements are common to different waves within a panel or to different panels.  Even elements that are common have been coded historically with different variable names.  Changes in the survey design and structure over time have added further obstacles to full use of data from all SIPP Panels.  Public access to and use of SIPP data are vital to meet the customer service objectives of the SIPP program.  The SIPP data user community is critical to the overall success of the SIPP program. The SIPP Utilities development was initiated under grants from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (HICHD) and currently contain core data from the 1984 through the 2001 Panels of SIPP; 14 of 27 topical modules in the 1984 through 2001 Panels of SIPP; and, the necessary internal tools to identify variables in any of the data files and extract data regardless of the format of the original SIPP files.  The purpose of this contract is to have the contractor complete the SIPP Utilities data access and harmonization tool that was initiated under the HICHD grants by incorporating data from the 13 remaining topical modules from the 1984  2001 Panels of the SIPP as well as both the core and topical module data from the 2004 Panel of the SIPP.   Promoting the completion of the SIPP Utilities data access and harmonization tool is one clear step in meeting the long-term needs of current and potential SIPP data users.  The contractor will complete documentation pages describing each remaining SIPP variable from the 1984 - 2001 SIPP panels, and add documentation pages describing each variable from the 2004 SIPP panel.  All information about the variable, from all waves, panels, and source files in which it exists will be consolidated into a single document.  Pages will include both human-readable and machine-readable sections.  The human-readable sections will show the description of the variable, its questionnaire context, its coding, links to related variables and appendices, applicable notes and advice on its use, and summary statistics.  Any variations among waves, panels, or source files will be explained.  The machine-readable section will specify its location and length in each of the data files in which it exists, its data type, and variable and value labels as applicable.  The contractor will complete the addition of the topical module data from the 1984-2001 Panel SIPP data to the current version of SIPP Utilities, updating 2001 files which were revised by the Census Bureau, adding the 13 topical modules from the 1984-2001 Panel data not yet included in the current iteration of the 1984-2001 version of the SIPP Utilities.  The contractor will also incorporate data from the 2004 Panel of SIPP into the 1984-2001 version of the SIPP Utilities.  This requires evaluating the 2004 Panel SIPP data to make sure the public use files are successfully compressed into the SIPP Utilities format, match and review all 2004 variables that were continued from 2001, add all 2004 variables that are new to SIPP, creating necessary new documentation files, and update the software, tables, and spreadsheets to 2004 Panel SIPP data.  The contractor will verify and debug a new 1984-2004 Panel version of SIPP Utilities.  The addition of these data will render obstacles invisible to the user, by assigning a single variable name to each variable, and allowing the user to specify extractions across panels by variable name alone.  The completion of SIPP Utilities will benefit the SIPP user community significantly, and provide data access where technical obstacles may have in the past prevented it for some users.  Other tasks include; 1. Planning Meetings and Progress Reports, 2.  Review current version of SIPP Utilities, 3.  Incorporate 1984-2001 SIPP Panel Data into the SIPP Utilities, 4. Incorporate 2004 SIPP Panel data into the SIPP Utilities, and 5.  Completed SIPP Utilities Software.  The period of performance will be 1 May 2009 through 30 April 2010 plus a twelve (12) month option period and a six (6) month option period.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District, intends to award on a sole source basis to Yank Marine, Inc., Mosquito Landing Road, Tuckahoe, NJ  08250.  The procurement is using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement is to provide various upgrades and repairs to the Workboat EVANS for a conversion from a workboat to a surveyboat. The repairs include relocation of a davit, fabrication of a side scan transducer cradle, modifications to the antennae mast, fabrication and installation of a multi-beam transducer mount, installation of cabinetry to mount the ancillary electrical components, and hull painting. The multi-beam transducer mount will incorporate a modified seachest design that will allow the transducer to swivel and be retracted out of the water for maintenance, cleaning, and safety. Yank Marine Incorporated located in Tuckahoe, New Jersey has previously designed, fabricated, and installed an identical transducer mount on the Philadelphia District owned SeaArk DAUNTLESS, a similar vessel to the Workboat EVANS.  Yank Marine is the only repair yard that has designed and installed this unique type of transducer mount and is capable of performing this same task on the EVANS.  Their knowledge of, and experience with this installation, is paramount in minimizing re-design time and costs, and installation by another repair yard and will allow the Surveyboat EVANS to return and complete its new surveying assignments with minimal impact and be ready to perform other surveying assignments that may arise in the Charleston District.  No RFQ will be issued based on this notice.  However, all information received within five (5) calendar days after date of publication of this notice will be considered SOLELY for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information received.  All contractors are required to be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Register before award as required by DFARS 204-7300.  Information on obtaining registration may be obtained by phoning 1-888-227-2423 or by accessing the following internet website:  http://www.ccr.gov.  The NAICS code is 336611 with a Size Standard of 1000 employees.

<DESC><p>The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is seeking to improve the services it provides to its Federal agency customers in the area of sustainable paper products including xerographic paper, coated and uncoated offset papers and newsprint. This RFI seeks information regarding the paper manufacturers' and their distributors' opinion, research and conclusions on the most sustainable paper products available in today's market for review by GPO and any other Federal agencies.
<p>GPO annually purchases paper for its own use and for the use of other Federal agencies. Pursuant to Section 1121, Title 44, United States Code, the GPO is a mandatory source of supply for printing and copier paper used by Federal agencies in the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area. The total amount of office paper purchased by GPO for its own use and for the use of Federal agencies is approximately $19 million per year. Of this total, approximately $6 million is copy paper.</p>
<p>The objective of this request for information is to inquire from industry leaders what sustainable attributes are available and which combination of features produces the most environmentally sustainable paper products. Currently the GPO provides a full catalog of paper products to various Federal agencies. This catalog includes a wide variety of paper and GPO would like to include additional information regarding environmental performance of all of its paper products to ensure customer education and satisfaction.</p>
<p>GPO is looking for information outlining the total Life Cycle Assessment of individual grade lines. This includes the sourcing of the raw materials, manufacturing, energy consumption, transportation and the recyclability of the end product. The vendor shall also provide information documenting third party certifications, self certifications, matrixes and formulas that are used to justify any claims. All paper products must meet testing requirements outlined by GPO's qualified products list.</p>
<p>Keeping GPO's goals in mind please submit the evaluation of no more than three grade lines of paper products per manufacturer. Please focus on the primary environmental attributes. Manufacturers and their distributors are hereby requested to submit a statement detailing and justifying the environmental attributes for any papers that meet the requirements on GPO's qualified products list. Please focus on these key attributes when describing the sustainable paper products:</p>
<p>1. Sourcing of raw materials <br />2. Use of renewable resources<br />3. Use of bio-generation<br />4. Chain of custody<br />5. Unique packaging<br />6. Chemicals and fillers<br />7. Carbon footprint<br />8. Minimizing waste generation<br />9. Recyclability<br />10. Water consumption<br />11. Transportation<br />12. Energy Consumption<br />13. Price</p>
<p>This announcement is a request for information only and does not obligate the GPO in any way. This is not a request for proposal and the GPO will not pay for any information submitted or for any expenses associated with providing information.</p>

<DESC><p>The 45th Space Wing issues this sources sought synopsis for information and planning purposes in support of the Metis project. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the government pay for information solicited. The anticipated contract will provide expert technical services to the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) on the Metis project with Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funding. The Metis project consists of document conversion to digital format and the development and maintenance of software tools and applications for file display. The conversion portion includes converting paper, fiche, and film products into an electronic format including performing automated and human optical character recognition and the addition of metadata to each digitized file to allow for rapid and thorough retrieval of relevant information. The software tools and applications portion includes integration of the electronic archive into current analyst tools and databases and developing robust web-based interfaces for customers to interrogate and visualize the information using a Mark Logic XML server and Net Owl entity extraction software. Additionally, the contractor will be required to develop and monitor a quality assurance program to ensure information is accurately digitized, indexed, and integrated. The conversion process requires 100 percent human review of scanned documents to ensure mission-related information and terms are properly identified in the metadata for later retrieval and use by analysts. Some original documents are of very poor quality and require review by knowledgeable personnel in order to recognize and flag key terms. Personnel performing the conversion and optical character recognition must have significant experience with and knowledge of the AFTAC organization, its history, and its nuclear monitoring mission with emphasis on nuclear materials collection and analysis. Conversion will be performed at AFTAC using government furnished equipment including six high-speed scanners, one microfiche scanner, and computers. Software tools and application development may be performed at AFTAC and at the contractor facility. Personnel working on the contract must have Top Secret/SSBI/SSPR dates and a current DCID 6/4 date at start of contract. Facility clearance requirement is Top Secret and protection level requirement is Secret. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541512/$25 million. A firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract is contemplated with a one-year basic contract period and four 1-year options. No technical or solicitation document exists at this time. All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services. The contractor will be required to establish Associate Contractor Agreements (ACA) with contractors supporting other AFTAC efforts. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. The response must not exceed 10 pages. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Firms responding must state whether they are a Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), an 8(a) firm, a Native American Firm, a HUBZone firm, a Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a participant in the Very Small Business Pilot Program, or a large business based on the size standard above. Point of contact is Ms. Kim Pattan, Contracting Officer, 45 CONS/LGCCB, 1030 South Highway A1A, MS1000, Patrick AFB FL 32925, e-mail: kim.pattan@patrick.af.mil.

Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Air Force Space Command ombudsmen, A7K, 150 Vandenberg St., Ste 1105, Peterson AFB CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, FAX: 719-554-5299, e-mail: a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil.

Provides detailed documentation of the contractor's methodology in arriving at the proposed cost of each element and recommends agreement or disagreement with the proposed amount.

4.  COMPLEXITY

Assignments involve substantial depth of analysis of many different and unrelated factors and processes for reaching a price recommendation on contractor's proposed cost elements.  Decisions involve interpretation, analysis, and negotiations regarding modification of contract terms and conditions, evaluation of contractual progress, and identification and solution of problems involving contracts assigned.  Factors vary for each situation because of variations in the terms of the contracts, products and services involved, and contractor capability and characteristics, i.e., the relationship with corporate headquarters, previous experiences, and degree of cooperation.  The work requires making final decisions on a variety of issues, such as cost and price allowability, negotiating settlements, resolving legal and technical problems, approving or disapproving expenditures incurred, estimating the percentage of completion for payment of fixed-fee, and fairness of salaries paid to Contractors employees.   

5.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is primarily conducted in an office or aircraft hangar with some travel to the field for meetings, conferences, activity reviews, and field inspections.

<SUBJECT>DUAL-BEAM SYSTEM INCLUDING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE AND FOCUSED ION BEAM
<SOLNBR>AMD-09-SS17
<RESPDATE>033109
<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a two-beam system including a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a high-resolution focused-ion-beam (FIB), both with advanced direct-write capabilities. The system will be used primarily for maskless fabrication of three-dimensional micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS), nano-photonic devices, nano-plasmonic device, and nano-optomechanical devices. This will be achieved by two-beam-enabled methods such as FIB milling, ion- or electron-induced gas-assisted etching, and ion- or electron-induced gas-assisted deposition. System will also be used for cross-sectional imaging, construction analysis, top-down and cross-sectional metrology, nano-wiring, and preparation of lamellas for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It will also serve as a platform for in-situ experiments involving real-time electrical and optical sample probing under simultaneous imaging or writing by SEM or FIB.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a dual-beam system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize Recovery Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.

NIST has a need for a dual-beam system that would meet the following requirements:

1.	Ion beam accelerating voltage should cover at least the range 500V to 30kV.  Ion-beam current should cover (in discrete values) at least the range 1.5 pA to 20nA.  Best achievable ion-beam resolution at the FIB-SEM coincident working distance should be no less than 5nm (at 30kV and at an ion current no less than 1.5pA). 
2.	Electron beam accelerating voltage should cover at least the range 350V to 30kV.  Electron beam resolution at the FIB-SEM coincident working distance should be equal to or better than 1.0nm at 15kV, equal to or better than 1.6nm at 5kV, and equal to or better than 2.5nm at 1kV.  
3.	To enable adequate management of the ion or electron dose delivered to the sample, it must be possible to switch from SEM imaging mode to FIB imaging mode (or FIB imaging mode to SEM imaging mode) without initiating a beam scan. 
4.	Stage should provide motion in at least 5 axes (x, y, z, tilt and rotation). Range of motion in x and y directions, respectively, should be at least 150mm, with a landing repeatability of at least 1 micron. For maximum processing flexibility, possible tilt angles should cover at least the range -10 degrees to 60 degrees.
5.	In order to facilitate setup of in-situ electrical and optical probing experiments, routine method for sample loading and unloading must not involve a load-lock, but must take place via a large, single door providing access to the vacuum chamber.  
6.	System should include a gas delivery system for beam-induced gas-assisted deposition. Deposition gases must include a gas for deposition of platinum, a gas for deposition of gold, and a gas for deposition of an insulator. 
7.	System should include a gas delivery system for beam-induced gas-assisted etching. Etch gases must include xenon difluoride (for selective etching of silicon), and a gas for selective etching of carbon-based materials (such as polymers, photoresists, or diamond). 
8.	System must be furnished with an in-situ mechanical probe allowing extraction of FIB-prepared samples such as lamellas for TEM microscopy.
9.	System must provide a built-in library of shapes which define useful or routine geometries and scanning strategies for FIB milling, ion- or electron- induced gas-assisted deposition, and ion- or electron-induced gas-assisted etching.
10.	Provided shape geometries must include square, rectangle, circle, ellipse, circular ring, elliptical ring and polygon. 
11.	To maximize process latitude, writing of FIB and SEM shapes should be achieved via an integrated digital pattern generator of resolution no less than 16 bit. Minimum dwell time must be no more than 25 nanoseconds.
12.	Shape properties should allow for specification of which beam (ion or electron) is to be used during shape execution. When shape is executed, system must automatically switch to specified beam. 
13.	During shape execution with a given beam (FIB or SEM), the system must be able to collect and display, as a live image, the secondary or back-scattered electron signal generated by that same beam. This live image should preferably be displayed within the graphical boundaries of the shape. In particular, this live-imaging feature is necessary for endpoint control during FIB milling of features not in the line of sight of the SEM (such as the bottom of a high-aspect-ratio hole).
14.	Live imaging with the SEM should be possible during shape execution with the FIB. Live imaging with the FIB should be possible during shape execution with the SEM.
15.	To maximize ease of use and process repeatability, shape size must be expressed in absolute (micron) dimensions, and not nominally depend on system magnification setting at time of execution.   
16.	To minimize hidden side-effects, shape position must be referenced only to center of the field of view, not to a stage position. 
17.	To avoid offsets, shape rotation must be achieved via the digital pattern generator, not via temporary rotation of the scan field. 
18.	To maximize ease of use and process latitude, shape properties must allow for independent specification of horizontal and vertical pixel spacing, in absolute dimensions.  
19.	For precise management of dose-rate effects during milling, it must be possible to explicitly specify the slow scan direction used during execution of a rectangular shape, including at least left-to-right, right-to-left, bottom-to-top, and top-to-bottom directions.  
20.	In order to enable milling, etching or deposition of shapes with complex topography, it must be possible, within a given shape, to specify a dwell time which varies from pixel to pixel. Such a specification must be achievable via use of a grayscale image bitmap.
21.	Shape properties should allow for specification of which gas is to be used (if any) during shape execution.  System must automatically insert relevant gas delivery nozzle upon launching of shape execution, automatically deliver specified gas during shape execution, and automatically retract nozzle upon completion of shape execution. 
22.	System must allow automatic execution of a group of shapes within a same field of view, where individual shapes may have, respectively, different values of dose, dwell time, scan direction, specified beam and specified gas.  It must be possible to explicitly specify the order of execution of the shapes. The full list of shapes ready for execution must be apparent, explicit and editable at all times. 
23.	System must allow for routine scripting and fully automatic execution of arbitrary, user-defined process sequences involving, but not limited to, FIB milling, ion- or electron- induced gas-assisted deposition, ion- or electron-induced gas-assisted etching, stage motion, SEM image acquisition, and FIB image acquisition.    
24.	It must be possible to store a group of shapes under a single name, as well as recall the group at a later time for immediate execution, including via a script.

Special Tasking Sampling and AnalysisSpecial Tasking may consist of pond and/or estuary investigations, agriculture plot sampling, unique one-time only sampling, and special sampling related to non-routine projects.  
Sampling and Analysis Timelines:A turnaround time for the laboratory analysis is a critical component for performance under this contract.  Tasks not completed and submitted within prescribed time constraints could result in the issuance of financial or other penalties against the Government.  Any resulting financial or other penalties incurred against the Government, under this contract, shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.  Some circumstances require turnaround of analytical results sooner than the standard turnaround times agreed upon by the Government.   Required emergency turnaround times will be coordinated between the Government Representative and the Contractor on a case-by-case basis. The Contractor must contact the Customer immediately when laboratory results are in violation of regulations, exhibit abnormal conditions, or are exceptions to NPDES permit conditions.

<DESC><p>WPAFB to host contractor information exchange at Wright State University
<p>By Derek Kaufman, 88th Air Base Wing Public Affairs</p>
<p>WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Ohio - The 88th Air Base Wing Operational Contracting Squadron here will host an Acquisition Information Session for contractors and vendors at the Ervin J. Nutter Center on the campus of Wright State University. This no cost event will take place April 27, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the Nutter Center's Berry Room.</p>
<p>"This event is focused on informing contractors how they can do business with us," said. Lt Col. Matthew Stevens, 88th CONS commander. The squadron's mission is to deliver products, services, and minor construction projects which support base customers across the installation.</p>
<p>The informational session will address contracted supplies and services to operate and maintain the base. Three 88th ABW organizations -- including the 88th CONS, 88th Civil Engineer Directorate, and 88th Communications Group -- will brief their current contracting emphasis, projected contracting actions forecasted up to the next two years, and basic concepts of conducting business with the government, specifically with Air Force activities performing missions at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Air Force procurement experts will also address questions from vendors, said Carol Young, a procurement analyst with the 88th CONS.</p>
<p>In addition, representatives from Small Business Administration (SBA) and General Services Administration (GSA) will be on hand with information on their respective organizations that vendors may find useful.</p>
<p>"Vendors wanting to better understand how to navigate the Air Force's procurement system may find this session valuable," Ms. Young said. "Beyond learning about what operational contracting projects are currently being awarded during Fiscal Year 2009, I think contractors will find our preview of the kinds of projects coming down the pike for FY 10 and FY 11 to be interesting and informative."</p>
<p>On-line registration is required. Seating is limited and event organizers ask companies to limit participation to two attendees per company. Registration for the event can be accomplished at http://wwwpublic.wpafb.af.mil/88abwcons/index.php. Deadline to register is April 17.</p>
<p>Mr. Randy Parker, 88th Air Base Wing Vice Director, will welcome Acquisition Information Session participants. The session agenda and presentation slides will be available for viewing on line at the registration website address beginning April 8 to enable potential registrants the opportunity to see what kinds of information will be presented. Attendees are encouraged to print the agenda and briefing slides as hard copies of the presentations will not be available at the event. Those who still have questions can contact Ms. Young at (937) 522-4648.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region 7 Alaska intends to award a Sole Source contract in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5, Section 5.203 and is supplemented with additional information contained within.  This announcement is not a formal request for proposals and the Government does not intend to evaluate or consider offers received.
Negotiations are estimated to occur approximately 15 days following the posting of this notice, with the estimated contract award approximately April 6, 2009.  The Government is contemplating award of a firm fixed price contract.
This announcement is for information purposes only.  No solicitation is available.  This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to compete this requirement.  A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice and currently available information about the intended recipient, is solely within the discretion of the Government. 
Background/History: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software is a visual as well as analytical tool that allows the user to communicate complex, spatially referenced data, in the form of layered images.  These images, when combined with written descriptions, provide a powerful means to disseminate biological data and processes.  The Region 7 FWS Conservation Genetics Laboratory (CGL) has recently incorporated GIS (ArcGIS version 9.2, ESRI) software into it's analysis of genetic data.  The purpose of this application is to better understand the processes and factors that influence genetic diversity within and among fish populations in Alaska.  We are now completing the first project incorporating GIS (Landscape Genetics of AYK salmon populations).  As part of this project. we plan to disseminate the data (layered images of the environmental and population-specific genetic data) to the general public via the internet.  The technical aspects of preparing a GIS-based multilayered graphical system that is suitable for internet access is beyond the skills of FWS personnel.
Scope: The contractor will develop a GIS-based multilayer interactive graphical system for the Landscape Genetics project that is suitable for disseminating spatially referenced landscape genetic data on the internet.  The landscape genetic data will include, but will not be limited to, the physical location of each population and estimates of genetic diversity (e.g., synthetic map from principle component data, Fst, heterozygosity) as well as the environmental and ecological data used in analysis.  This multilayered graphical system will be generated from ArcGIS data layers but will not require the viewer to have ArcGIS software.  The system will be operable through freely available on-line programs such as Adobe Acrobat and Google Earth.  In addition, the system will include layers of text that describe the images and provide instruction to the viewer on navigating through the layers.  The actual ArcGIS version 9.2 (ESRI) data layers will also be made available as links associated with the system.  These data layers will be made available in .SHP and .KML format that can be downloaded and used in ArcGis and Google Earth software, respectively.  The contractor will also provide FGDC compliant metadata describing the GIS data.  All data layers will be provided to the contractor by CGL staff.  The contractor and CGL staff will test the system prior to placement on the CGL web page.  Placement of this system on the CGL web page (accessed through the FWS Region 7 web site) will be the responsibility of CGL staff and FWS Region 7 IT personnel.Deliverables: A GIS-based multilayer interactive graphical system that is suitable for disseminating, via the internet, spatially referenced genetic, environmental, and ecological data from the Landscape Genetics project.Schedule:  This project will start April 6 and end May 30.

Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30 are incorporated. This is Full and Open Competition requirement under NAICS 721110, with a Size Standard of $7.0 Million for reporting actions purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/FEMA has a requirement for hotel/motel rooms for up to a total of 128 "room nights" for participants attending the FY 2009 Homeland Security Preparedness Technical Assistance Program (HSPTAP)/Enhancing Grants Management Technical Assistance Program Workshop in Chicago, IL. DHS/FEMA has scheduled the conference for May 27-28, 2009. The Government procures lodging to insure the availability of rooms for a large number of people at the same location in order to receive at a minimum, the Government rate in accordance with the GSA Federal Travel Regulations. The hotel/motel shall be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. The hotel/motel must be capable of offering facilities accommodating up to approximately 60 attendees considering guest rooms and all other business associated conference facilities (See Attached SOW/Details).

Conference attendees will make their reservations by individual call in; rooms will be reserved on each caller's personal credit card. If the hotel/motel is contacted by a Federal Government employee, the caller will be required to pay for their lodging using their personal Federal Government Travel Card. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

The "Grand Total" is a Not-To-Exceed price - whereby the hotel/motel shall only invoice the Government for, and the Government shall only pay for, conference facilities/space and audio-visual costs if separately quoted cost items, and the actual number of guest rooms not occupied and paid for by anticipated conference attendees during the period of the conference in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. The quote for blocking the number of guests rooms shall be structured in a format that indicates if the break/snack costs are included as part of the quoted room costs, whether or not the conference facilities/space are included as part of the package covering the cost of the guest rooms to be blocked, or if this will be a separate charge in accordance with the offeror's standard contract terms and conditions. Additionally, offerors must clearly indicate the cost of the audio-visual requirements if not included as part of the conference facilities/space. If the break/snack cost, the conference facilities/space and the cost of the audio-visual are not provided as an integral part of the cost of guest rooms to be blocked in accordance with the hotels standard contract, the price of the conference facilities and audio-visual requirements must be clearly listed as separate cost items. If the break/snack costs are not or cannot be included in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations guest room cost, please clearly indicate this cannot be done as the break/snack requirement and cost will then be deleted in its' entirety from the resulting order. Offerors shall also provide a copy of their standard contract listing all terms and conditions upon which the quote is based. A purchase order in the amount sufficient to cover all quoted costs will be issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror representing the best value to the Government.

Upon final determination and payment of all pending charges payable by the Government in order to satisfy the terms of the hotel's accepted contract, all remaining funding on the purchase order will be de-obligated. The per-night lodging cost shall not exceed the cost listed in the Federal Travel Regulations. Additionally, in order to insure competitiveness, additional discounts are encouraged. It is requested that the Federal Government be granted a general tax exemption for all rooms to be paid for by the Federal Government. Quotes shall be inclusive of the per-night cost per room, a sub-total cost indicating the cost for each of the night periods separately, and a Grand Total for the entire period. In order to be considered for award, the offer must be determined to be technically acceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The technical evaluation factors for this procurement are Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).

Submit quotations to the office specified in this solicitation on or before the date specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation.

The vendor agrees to establish a firm timeframe in which the proposed price is good for.<br />(d) Reserved<br />(e) Multiple quotations. Vendors are encouraged to submit multiple quotations presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) Reserved<br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in FAR 13.106-2. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received. <br />(h) Reserved<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(l) Reserved<br />(End of Provision)<br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

(End of addendum)


BASIS FOR AWARD:  In accordance with FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1)  PRODUCT DEMONSTRATION MODELS (PDMs) - will be evaluated for the following:

Conformance with the purchase descriptions for Table I - Physical Requirements for Basic Material and Material Requirements, Table II - Finished Measurements and visual examination.

2)  PRODUCTION/MANAGEMENT PLAN  will be evaluated for the following.  All subfactors are equal in importance:

Sub-factor 2.1 Proposed Management Approach:  
The offerors personnel/labor pool to determine if they possess the requisite human resources to perform the requirements of the solicitation;

The offerors infrastructure to determine if they possess the production facilities and resources (suppliers) necessary to meet solicitation requirements in compliance with the Buy American Act, the H.R.1/Berry Amendment and Small Business Set-Aside Restrictions;

The offerors program/production schedule to assess their ability to produce the required unit quantities on time (estimated @ 20,000 annually with surge capability of 50,000 annually) and to keep the program on schedule (capable of producing/delivering 10,000 within 60 days);  

Sub-factor 2.2  Proposed Quality Plan:
The offerors plan to monitor, measure, and ensure product quality in all phases of contract performance and in accordance with Purchase Description T-Shirt, Physical Fitness Uniform, US Coast Guard, Revised 24 November 2008; Purchase Description Trunks, Physical Fitness Uniform, US Coast Guard, dtd October 20, 2008;

3) EXPERIENCE  will be evaluated for the following:

The offerors proposal demonstrates the vendors ability to manufacture the items under this solicitation or items similar in nature in accordance with Government specifications and delivery requirements.

4) PAST PEFORMANCE  will be evaluated for the following:

Relevance and extent of previous contracts, quality and conformance of supplies/services to contract requirements, timely delivery/performance, customer satisfaction, and cost control.  Past performance information (PPI) utilized in the evaluation will be obtained from contractor references, as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  Contractor references that cannot be contacted will not be considered.  Greater weight (both positive and/or negative) will be given for performance under previous contracts that are more similar in scope, size and complexity to this procurement.  Those offerors with no relevant past performance information will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably, however, an offer with no relevant past performance history may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.

(4) Price:  For evaluation purposes, all offerors should submit pricing for maximum ordering quantities of 50,000 (for each trunk and shirt) for each of the five (5) years.  The offerors proposed price will be evaluated but not rated.

Award under this procurement will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  All (4) factors mentioned above are of equal importance and all (4) factors are more important than price.  As technical scores converge, the price grows more important in making the award selection.  The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:

Department of Homeland Security
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

<DESC>The following are answers to questions received prior to the 1:00pm Eastern on March 12, 2009 deadline for questions:

Question 14:  Given the very short response time and the need for Q&A turnaround, can the SEC offer an extension to the submission deadline?  
Answer 14:  The SEC is looking for an available commercial product/service that will meet the requirement.  Therefore, the submission date will not be extended.

Question 15:  Please elaborate on whether and to what extent industry-specific accounting experts would be necessary to accomplish the Governments accounting fraud risk-rating standard.
Answer 15:  The SEC is looking for an available commercial product/service that will meet the requirement.  It is up to the Contractor to determine how to fulfill the requirement.

Question 16:  The requirements call for a web-based service interface with initial access for 80 users.  Please describe the tracking application requirements to the extent possible.  
Beyond searching and filtering by company name, date, and industry sector to view comparative risk ratings, for example, what capabilities would users require?  
Answer 16:  The minimum requirements were stated in the RFQ.

Question 17:  Would certain roles have the need to attach comments, add private notes, research, etc.?  
Answer 17:  The minimum requirements were stated in the RFQ.

Question 18:  Would the service need certain security and encryption standards?  Could the service be hosted externally?  If not, please describe the acceptable technology standards. 
Answer 18:  The SEC expects the service to be hosted externally.

Question 19:  Would the database/service optimally exchange data with other data sources such as EDGAR and/or the IDEA system (via XBLR) for analysis?  With what latency standard (e.g. real-time, daily, or weekly)?  
Answer 19:  The exchange of data with other data sources is not a requirement.

Question 20:  Is the analysis scope limited to public SEC filing information?  Will the envisioned service authorize/require the contractor to utilize any supplemental financial or accounting information requested by the SEC from the company as it relates to public filings already made? 
Answer 20:  It is up to the Contractor to determine what data sources will fulfill the requirement.  There is no requirement for the Contractor to incorporate any supplemental information requested by the SEC from the company. 

Question 21:  What is the Governments envisioned timeline for risk-rating service delivery (e.g. production implementation) for the described web-interface?  Please confirm our assumption that any contractor currently or prospectively engaged with firms in the target segment (more than $200 million market capitalization) as an auditor would be conflicted out of this initiative.
Answer 21:  This is a request for a quote for a product that is commercially available now.

If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(l) Reserved<br />(End of Provision)<br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<DESC>Q3: Is it possible to receive a list of attendees for the Industry Day?

A3:  List attached.  Also there is a tab in FBO identifying those interested in the project, some of whom may not have attended the Industry Day.

Q4: When was the last time the T-700 air dynamometer was serviced?  

A4: The last Overhaul date is unknown. The current Air Dynamometer is being serviced every 50 hours according to the maintenance manual. With the extended maintenance schedule the Dyno is capable of operating for 1000 hours. The Dyno was installed at 2035 hours; currently there is 2570 hours. This leaves an operational life of 465 hours before it will require overhaul.

Q5: Who is the manufacturer of the air dynamometer and what is the serial number? 

A5: The manufacturer is Northern Research and Engineering, NREC. The Dyno is a T58/T700 Turboshaft Engine Air Dynamometer; part number 1314AS100-1; serial number 077.

Q6. Do you have any reason to replace the dynamometer?

A6: Yes, it is identified in Section 5.0 entitled Requirements as one of the systems to be upgraded.

Q7. Are you pleased with your existing fuel metering system for the two cells?  Do you want this upgraded to improve accuracy?

A7: No. Yes, it is identified in Section 5.0 entitled Requirements as one of the systems to be upgraded. 
 
Q8. There are 5 instrumentation cabinets in the ATF3 control room.  We were told the middle of these 5 cabinets contains wiring coming from both the ATF3 cell and the LTS101 cell.  Is the wiring form the ATF3 cell thrust stand and the LTS101 cell test stand intermixed or separate.  How about the facility wiring from each cell?  Is this intermixed or separate?  

A8: Yes, the center cabinet of the 5 contains wiring for both the ATF3 and LTS-101cells. There is also wiring with the T-700 cell that is interconnected with the LTS-101 cell. The ATF3, LTS-101, and T-700 test cells have some intermixed functions.  The ATF3 Thrust Stand and LTS-101 Test Stand wiring enter through the overhead in the center cabinet but connect to the separate ADAS systems. The interconnectivity of the ATF3 and LTS-101 systems, deals mostly with Facility Control Monitors and power distributions.  The facility wiring for the three test cells are intermixed. Some of the mixed functions include:  Power from the UPS; AC and DC power; Fuel Pump Control and monitoring; Preservation Pump Control; Fire System; 28vdc Starter Power Control; Nitrogen Pressure Monitoring; Internal Communications; Emergency 28vdc power to the fuel control valves; Emergency 28vdc power to the fuel meters.

Q9: What is the annual throughput for the jet and Turboshaft cells?  How many engines do you test per month or per year in each cell?

A9: The facility is to test 36 ATF3 engines and 69 T700 engines this fiscal year. These numbers vary slightly each year depending on demand.

Q10: Section 5 of the SOO indicates that the items #2 Load or Dynamometer System, #17 FOD Screens, #18 Bypass Ducting, #19 Hot Shrouds, and #20 Test Bed (T-700 & CT7 use same test bed interchangeably) are required to be included in the upgrade.  Is it the Coast Guards intent to have these systems completely replaced with new?

A10: It is the CG intent to have all systems identified in Section 5.0, as a minimum, upgraded to allow reliable engine testing in accordance with OEM specifications for the engines being tested.

Q11: Are there any known issues with the existing Air Dynamometer?

A11: Yes. The air Dyno is outdated and spare parts are not available. The CG has not called for a specific type of replacement to allow the vendor to be able to recommend a type of replacement. The water-cooling tower and pump room for the middle Cell can be modified by the vendor to allow for two operational cells.

Q12: Will FAA certification be required?

A12: FAA certification is not required; however meeting FAA standards is desired wherever possible.

Q13: Are CT7-9C3 engines being tested by the USCG at this time?  If so, can sample run data sheets be made available?

A13: ALC is not currently testing the CT7 engine.  It is anticipated that this testing will begin at the end of 2009 and into 2010. There are no sample run data sheets. The Data sheets used are produced by the data acquisition software. 

Q14: What is the expected product output from ALC Elizabeth City in terms of the CT7-9C3 engine  tested engines with run data sheets OR tested engine-gearbox units with run data sheets?

A14: Next year in a worst case ALC will have six engines to test. The numbers will increase over the next 4 to 6 years as the Coast Guard obtains new aircraft. Eventually ALC will have a full fleet to support. 

Q15: Statement of Objectives, 2.0 Scope states repositioning of the control consoles for both the ATF3 and T700 systems.  What drives the need for repositioning the ATF-3 console?

A15: Repositioning of the consoles was put in to allow the vendor the option based on the design of his console. The current location of the ATF3 console is fine.

Q16: Similarly, what drives the need for the T700 console?  If its present location in the cleaning room is not acceptable, what other areas are?

A16: The current location for the T700 console is fine. It is there to allow the vendor some freedom based on the design and layout of his console.

There are several more questions/answers to be provided later this week.

<DESC><p>The 6th Contracting Squadron will be soliciting a 100% small business set-aside, competitive Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build construction efforts to support the 6th CES mission at MacDill AFB and Avon Park, Florida. This acquisition will encompass requirements that have, in the past, been acquired utilizing the Base Engineering Support contractor. Individual task order work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task order limits will be $2,000 to $5,000,000. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed $150M over a five-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.<br /><br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $31M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $31M. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement and removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, painting, roofing and paving. Locations of work will be at MacDill AFB, and Avon Park Range, FL. Offers are solicited only from business concerns who are current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan.
<p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3, and AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, targeted toward competitive offerors with a 45-day response time (offers due 45 days after issuing). In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to six (6) contracts to small businesses, who give the Air Force the greatest confidence that they can meet our requirements for up to 100% design and construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, and/or airfield work. The solicitation will include a design/build seed project that will be used to evaluate these capabilities. The seed project is to Repair Hangar 2 Sanitary Sewer System and Bathrooms. The seed project magnitude is between $500,000 to $1,000,000.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. MacDill AFB plans to include the following factors and sub-factors: 1) Mission Capability, 2) Proposal risk; 3) Past Performance; and 4) Pricing. Within the Mission Capability Factor the following 4 sub-factors will be used: a) Organizational Structure b) Technical Capability/Execution and Completeness of the Seed Project c) Change and Cost Control Management, and d) Quality Control Procedures. Mission Capability, Proposal Risk, and Past Performance Factors are considered equal in importance. The sub-factors within Mission Capability are also considered equal in importance. Combined, all three factors are significantly more important than cost or price. Cost/Price, however, will contribute substantially to the selection decision and will be assessed for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Up to six (6) highest rated offerors from the source selection will receive basic contract award. The highest rated offeror will be awarded the seed project.<br />All future task orders will be competed among all the contract awardees. All contractors receiving award will receive a not-to-exceed $2,000 task order for the MACC Orientation Seminar to satisfy the contract minimum requirement.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 9&nbsp;Mar 2009 and close on or about 45 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the CCR database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Affymetrix, Inc., 3420 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051.  National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland requires 100K arrays, Mendel arrays, and assay kits which will be used for finding and studying genes related to drug abuse.Affymetrix is producing gene arrays that contain 1,000,000 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), the only arrays commercially available at that density.  Analysis of SNP's in the human genome is crucial to our studies of drug abuse vulnerability loci.  This gets close to reasonable power for detection of most of the addiction vulnerability loci in our samples, according to our modeling.  The addition of this approach to our ongoing studies will put us in the forefront of drug abuse related genetic research.  In accordance with FAR6.302-1, the supplies required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, Affymetrix, Inc. and no other supplier will satisfy the agency requirements.  There are no licensed systems or instruments offered by third party providers that are able to use any components of the Affymetrix, Gene Chip System, including arrays.  The highest SNP density commercially available is needed to identify drug abuse vulnerability loci and prove or disprove the idea of polygenic contributions of common allelic variants to drug abuse vulnerability.  

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NIHDA2009085 may be submitted to the NIDA, IRP, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 200, BRC Bldg., Rm 04A326, Baltimore, MD  21224, ATTN:  Carol Lindsay
