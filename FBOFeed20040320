<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture(USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New York officials, requires four (3) firm-fixed price requirements contracts for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Manhattan, Brooklyn, West Queens, East Queens and Long Island areas of the State of New York.  During the spring of 2004, APHIS anticipates applying control treatments to approximately 113,000 host trees with an estimated 1,400,000 diameter at breast height (dbh)via trunk injection, estimated 23,000 host trees with an estimated 292,000 dbh via soil injection and 1,300 host trees with an estimated 5,200 dbh via soil drench total in all contract areas.  Control treatment applications are intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza and London Plane.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture had declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  Requirements contracts will be awarded to ensure contractual coverage is in place in the event additional control treatment applications are required or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, or date of award, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period of each contract awarded.  The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about January 30, 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer 3 weeks thereafter.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average annual receipts.  Telephone requests for a copy of the RFP will not be honored.

<CONTACT>Ariful Chowdhury ariful.chowdhury@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>DCGS-AF Block 20 will be a modernized advanced technology upgrade to the AN/GSQ-272 weapon system.  The DCGS-AF provides worldwide Tasking, Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (TPED) of all Air Force air and ground Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) data and information, to include collaboration with all-source data from all other ISR sensors and systems. The current DCGS-AF (Block 10.2, in development) is an initial network-centric framework that will operate on the Global Information Grid (GIG), providing Tasking, Posting, Processing and Utilization (TPPU) capabilities.  Block 20 may be either an evolutionary or a revolutionary transformation from Block 10.2 The DCGS-AF weapon system will be fully compliant with all DoD C4ISR standards, including DOD Joint Technical Architecture (JTA), the Joint Airborne SIGINT Architecture (JASA), the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSGI), the Joint Airborne MASINT Architecture (JAMA), the DCGS Acquisition Standards Handbook – IMINT (DASH-I ) and related Office of the Secrteary of Defense (OSD) DCGS standards and applicable NATO STANAGs in the integration of multi-INT TPED capabilities and best commercial practices. Block 20 will reduce the need for human-in-the-loop, do IMINT, MASINT and SIGINT TPED and TPPU better and faster with advanced technology including multi-INT fusion of information and collaboration with other Service, National and coalition C4ISR capabilities.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture(USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with Illinois officials, requires three (3) firm-fixed price requirements contracts for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) within the State of Illinois.  The first contract will cover the Chicago area, the second and third contract will cover Park Ridge (for Ravenwood with Damen Avenue as the east/west dividing line).  The application is intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza and London Plane.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture had declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 86,301 (+- 20%) trees and an estimated total DBH of 968,879 (+/- 20%) inches, as follow:

Chicago, West Ravenswood:  23,240 trees at 329,824 total DBH by soil injection
				   5,292 trees at   42,345 total DBH by trunk injection
Chicago, East Ravenswood:   23,830 trees at 319,017 total DBH by soil injection
				  1,178 trees at   14,589 total DBH by trunk injection
Park Ridge, Forest Preserve:  31,780 trees at 246,626 total DBH by trunk injection
Park Ridge, Residential Area:     981 trees at   16,478 total DBH by trunk injection.  THE SOLICITATION IS EXPECTED TO BE POSTED BY COB FEBRUARY 2, 2004, WITH PROPOSALS DUE TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER FOUR WEEKS THEREAFTER.  The effective period of the contract will be from date of award through September 30, 2004, WITH FOUR UNILATERAL OPTION YEARS.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average annual receipts.  TELEPHONE REQUESTS FOR A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE HONORED.

TOP LOADING CONTAINER HANDLERS
Statement of Work:   

	1.   SCOPE.  This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required for the purchase and testing of four (4) Top Loading Container Handlers (TLCH), warranty, and preventative maintenance training. This purchase will include associated training and spare parts and tooling lists allowing for completion of routine maintenance for a period of 1 (one) year after delivery. Additionally, vendor must demonstrate through a Statement of Qualification that that it is an ongoing entity with past sales and service experience for the offered item for a ten (10) year period.

	1.1 Background.  The Supplemental Allocation provided in the 2207 Report and the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) Program Management Office (PMO) has been initiated to design, develop, produce, and deploy services, products, and construction to support rebuilding the infrastructure and economy of Iraq. The Port of Umm Qasar is an integral part of the infrastructure rebuilding and improvement efforts to move goods, people, and raw materials supporting inter-state and international commerce and exchange. To support this effort TLCHs are necessary to allow movement of Containers between the Ports Container Cranes, flatbed trailers and rail and truck staging areas. This capability is essential to the efficient movement of materials between sea ports, rail heads, and truck carriers. The TLCH specification is a commercial material handling equipment specification. The desired equipment must meet or exceed the specifications of the Taylor Machine Works THDC-955 MIT Loaded Container Handler. Due to degraded training and supply chain operations, a 1 (one) year on-site maintenance agreement covering parts and service is required for the interim rebuilding operations. Due to the poor state of trained personnel training covering routine maintenance for 25 personnel should be made, upon mutual agreement between the awardee and the Umm Qasar Port Manager, available at the Port facilities to occur no more than 30 days after delivery. Finally, while the industry is in an infant state of development it is important that capital equipment buys have long-term viability, therefore the customer seeks to reduce risk by elimination proposals from individuals without the financial stability and standard capacity to support after-sales service of the equipment.
