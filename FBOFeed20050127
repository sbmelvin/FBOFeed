<DESC>This is a synopsis being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 12.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the September 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 97-27.  



It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to purchase a renewal license agreement from EO Productions International, Inc DBA Collexis Solutions suite consisting of a set of components which together represent software for making large amounts of unstructured information easily accessible. Collexis® is based on the principle of fingerprinting. The system can create a fingerprint for each piece of text that contains relevant information, such as competence sheets, project descriptions or web pages. The fingerprinting process makes use of a structure of professional terminology of a particular field (essentially a thesaurus). By doing so it embodies the way humans understand those terms and concepts.

 

Collexis® fingerprints, like human ones, are very small but still unique representations of their source. A Collexis® catalog contains only fingerprints, not the original information. This makes the process of matching a catalog with a search fingerprint extremely fast.  The period of performance will be for one year with three (3) additional one years option.  This is a proprietary license agreement procurement. Based on Market Research, the Collexis software provides a unique capability that is not provided in any other software currently available.  

 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within 3 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM.  The quoter shall include all information which documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation. All proposals received within the time period stated above from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order.  Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR): http://www.arnet.gov/far/.

<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Columbia Area Office, Ephrata Field Office, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Okanogan Irrigation District (OID) to assist in the Ephrata Field Office, by providing technical and other services, in the administration of cabin site leases at Conconully Lake and Conconully Reservoir in Conconully Washington.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (B).  Reclamation, OID, and the State of Washington entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) dated February 29, 1952, governing the administrations of the recreational resources and facilities within the vicinity of Conconully reservoir and lake for a period of 50 years.  It was later amended to allow OID to issue summer home site leases, under general plans to be approved by Reclamation.  OID leased 83 cabin sites and 4 commercial sites located along the shoreline of Conconully Lake and Conconully Reservoir.  This agreement expired on February 28, 2002.  Upon expiration Reclamation was directed to administer the leases directly.  OID is the only entity that would have the required background information on administration of the cabin site leasing at Conconully.  They have provided oversight of the cabin leasing program at Conconully since 1952.  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed abouve that will satisfy the agency's needs.  Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the contracting officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  All responses received by close of business February 7, 2005. will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 754-0206, Attn.  Harmony Smith, or by electronic mail at hsmith@pn.usbr.gov.

<DESC>The US DOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Service Center intends to procure, on a sole item/sole source basis, the Knightâs Armament Company MK-11 MOD 0 (SR-25) (a sole item) from Knightâs Armament Company, 701 Columbia Blvd., Titusville, FL 32780 (a sole source) to satisfy the critical mission requirements of the NNSA Office of Secure Transportation (OST). NNSA OST has determined that the Knightâs Armament Company MK-11 MOD 0 (SR-25) is the only item capable of meeting NNSA OST mission requirements, and the Knightâ s Armament Company is the only firm capable of providing 150 each of the items within the required delivery schedule.  This procurement is a Small Business Set-Aside, and Knightâs Armament Company is a Small Business under North American Industrial Classification System Code 332994, with a size standard of 1000 employees. The NNSA decision to select the MK-11 MOD 0 (SR-25) is based on testing by two DOE facilities over a two-year period.  Multiple weapons systems were tested and Knightâs MK-11 MOD 0 was chosen based primarily on the following test results: (1) the kit is supplied with a sound suppressor that reduces the overall signature of the weapons report; (2) the sound suppressor acts as a flash suppressor reducing the muzzle blast, which decreases the likelihood of someone observing the shooterâs position, a feature unique to the SR-25; and, (3) the MK 11 MOD 0 was designed specifically for use with the M118LR sniper round, currently in production from Lake City Arsenal (testing conducted by NNSA OST demonstrated that the effectiveness, range and accuracy of the MK 11 was increased to approximately 1,200 yards when operated in conjunction with the M118R round). Accordingly, the NNSA Service Center intends to conduct this sole-item/sole-source procurement under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 and no other items or sources will be considered. A public solicitation will not be available.  This notice satisfies the requirements of FAR Part 5.  The estimated value of the procurement is $1.2 M. Any questions or comments pertaining to this action shall be faxed to (505) 284-7027, ATTN: David Gallegos, NNSA Contract Specialist, not later than Monday, February 7, 2005.

<DESC>Description: The scope of this project (WWCX 05-1035) requires the contractor to furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to correct deficient subgrade drainage and reconstruct subgrade depressions in airfield aprons and taxiways at Thule Air Base, Greenland.  The work includes but is not limited to leveling the base coarse and replaining deteriorated pavement, including lighting, painting and markings. The work is broken down into separate and distinct phases.  Phase I of the Taxiways and Aprons has been completed under separate contract. The remaining work will consist of Taxiways, Phase II (approx. 29,431 SY), Aprons, Phase II (approx. 59,270 SY), Taxiways, Phase III (approx. 47,600 SY), Aprons, Phase III (approx. 18,650 SY) and Aprons, Phase IV (approx. 10,235 SY), to include taxiway lighting (listed as a separate phase). The contractor shall be responsible for determining the amount of work needed to fulfill the requirements of the contract specifications and drawings.  All quantities listed in the contract documents are estimates only. The awardee will be responsible for determining actual needs.  Rock materials shall be mined and milled on-site at Thule Greenland utilizing the awardees equipment. The awardee will be responsible for obtaining the necessary shipping and use permits for explosives, etc. required to perform the work. The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October. Additionally, Thule Air Base's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift. Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally. The project is broken down into 5 separate and distinct phases of work. The project magnitude (totaling 5 phases) is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. Because of the size of this project and funds availability, the Government proposes to award a Firm, Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a 5-year ordering period and list each phase as a separate contract line item number (CLIN). Each CLIN would then have subCLINs for each Fiscal Year (FY) from FY05 through FY09 listing the price of work should it start in that respective FY (i.e, 0001AA would represent a price for award of a CLIN with performance starting in FY05, 0001AB would represent a price for award of the same CLIN with performance starting in FY06, etc). The performance period for each phase shall be approximately 2 years from issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP). The NTP will be issued simultaneously with the delivery order(s). Even though the phases performance period covered more than one year, the price to be paid would be that corresponding to the subCLIN representing the FY of award. More than one Phase may be ordered at a time (i.e., Phase II of Aprons and Phase II of Taxiways, etc). There will be no price adjustments allowed for inflation or changes in the economy. The IDIQ will have a minimum obligation of 1 (one) CLIN for performance starting this summer (FY05). Additional phases (CLINs) will be ordered via delivery order as needed, funded, and allowed by schedule. For example, if Phase II Aprons is completed in FY 06 and FY07 funding becomes available, the Government would award a delivery order for Phase III Aprons utilizing the subCLIN price corresponding to the price for performance starting in FY07. A NTP will be issued with the delivery order starting the 2-year performance period, requiring completion of the work of Phase III Aprons in FY09, 2 years later.  More than one phase may be ordered during the same FY, depending on schedule and funding (i.e., Phase II of Aprons and Phase II of Taxiways; Phase III of Taxiways and Phase IV of Aprons, etc), but each will be ordered under a separate delivery order.  Performance-Price Tradeoff (PPT) shall be used as the method of evaluation. Evaluation Price will be determined by adding all subCLINs for all CLINs. Price will be evaluated equally with Past Performance. A more favorable past performance rating may result in award to other than the lowest priced offeror, based on the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation.  It is anticipated the solicitation documents, including specifications and drawings, shall be posted electronically on or about 10 Feb 2005 with offers due 30 days thereafter.  Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted. This solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(4) International Agreement, to only US and Danish firms.  Although no hard-copies of the solicitation will be distributed, those firms interested in receiving a CD ROM version may request such by writing to: Detachment 1, 21 Contracting Squadron, PSC 73, APO AE 09716 or Detachment 1, 21 Contracting Squadron, U.S. Embassy, Dag Hammarskjolds Alle 24, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.

Telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted, but faxed or e-mailed requests are allowed. Our fax number is (country code 45) 3526-5108.

In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR.  The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.   Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.

Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.

Vendors should regularly access the specified websites to ensure they have downloaded any and all amendments. In accord with FAR 6.302-1, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to solicit Tom Sawyer Software Corporation located at 1625 Clay Street, Sixth Floor, Oakland CA 04612-1531, on a sole source basis, for delivery of (1) Quantity 2, Development licenses and (2) Quantity 22, Deployment licenses of Tom Sawyer Graph Editor Toolkit for ActiveX, V5.2, with rights and support for 3 years.  Delivery FOB-Destination to NSWCDD within 10 days of order award.  Standard commercial documentation/manuals and warranty shall convey.   This Graph Editor Toolkit software has the following minimum salient characteristics:  (a) It is a robust, scalable, and incremental graph management, visualization, layout, and analysis software tool that focuses on representing data in the relational format of graphs or diagrams.   (b) It renders graphs from relational information available from a Government-developed graph analysis software called SNAKE V2.2.   (c) The required software product has an open, flexible, and mature architecture or Application Programmers Interface (API) that enables it to integrate with the SNAKE V2.2 software using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET.   (d) Mature architecture, inherent to the required software, provides extensive documentation and code examples and allows the Government to produce graph products more quickly and easily than is possible with a simpler or less-mature architecture.   (e) In-memory architecture allows the Government to draw graphs from data stored within the memory of the host application, rather than requiring the user to import/export data (f) Extensive out-of-the-box graph layout library, inherent to the required software allows the Government to quickly and easily develop and customize graphs.  (There are other commercial graph visualization libraries but they are general visualization tools or flow chart tools without the degree of functionality, relative to graph visualization, associated with the required software.) (g) The required software renders graphs using Government-defined constraints and attributes and, while this capability is not out-of-the-box, it is achievable with minimal effort as compared with other software tools commercially available for this purpose. (h) In combination with the other features inherent to the software, the required software has graph display features and benefits which are either unique or superior in function:  multiple-level hierarchical nested graph drawing; drill-down capability; multiple shapes for nodes (makes efficient use of white space while zooming in and out while allowing multiple shapes for nodes); curved edges (so graphs may be drawn with curved connections between nodes); robust hidden nodes; edges, and sub-structures; and multiple level undo-redo; a superior compact display; cross-diagram linkages.  The Government will consider statements, from all responsible sources, which evidence capability to provide the required items within the required delivery schedule, submitted via email to XDS13@nswc.navy.mil:  please reference synopsis number N00178-05-Q-3022 when responding.   Capability statements which do not evidence ability to deliver licenses for software product with the required minimu! m salient characteristics within the required schedule will not be considered.   Offerors must submit capability statements within 7 days of synopsis publication. Closing date is 1 February 2005 at 2:00 pm EST.   Award will be subject to Simplified Acquisition Procedures, in accordance with FAR 13.5 for acquisition of commercial items.  Successful offeror will be required to complete and submit Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items at FAR 52.213-3 and DFAR 252.212-7000 and shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database.  Estimated award date is 4 February 2005.

<ARCHDATE>01272006
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>BLM Request for Proposals, NAR050028, FEEDING OF WILD HORSES AT THE BLM PALOMINO VALLEY WILD HORSE & BURRO CENTER IN NEVADA FOR A 12-MONTH PERIOD, WITH FOUR 12-MONTH OPTIONS. Solicitation number NAR050028 applies and is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the following requirement: The Bureau of Land Management's Palomino Valley Wild Horse & Burro Center has a requirement for feeding services 365 days per year, including holidays, from May 1, 2005 to April 30, 2005, with an option for up to 4 more 12-month periods. The Palomino Valley Wild Horse & Burro Center is located 20 miles north of Sparks, Nevada on State Route 445. The Palomino Valley Wild Horse and Burro Center receives horses and burros directly from the range after they have been gathered. The horses and burros are delivered by single deck trailers with up to 40 horses in one trailer. The horses and burros can be delivered from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm seven days a week. The Contractor will arrive between 7 AM and 8 AM daily and continue to feed for up to 7 hours per day during peak times. During the gathering season the facility will normally receive 400 to 500 animals per month, however, occasionally up to 1,000 head will arrive. The gathering season is approximately from July 1 through February 28. Therefore, the slowest times in terms of care and feeding of captured animals are from April through June. BLM does not gather horses during the foaling season (March 1 through June 30). Although the BLM does not gather horses during this time, the facility will still have horses and burros being prepared for disposition. The number of animals in the facility coincides with the gathering season. For the months of August through March, the facility averages between 1,200 and 1,500 head per day. The remaining months the facility averages between 200 and 500 head per day. The Contractor shall provide sufficient personnel to assure the daily feeding of up to 2,500 animals during the peak times (August through March) and as few as 50 animals during the slack times (April through June). The total facility is capable of holding up to 2,500 animals at one time. The facility consists of 10 outside pens and 36 smaller inside pens. The outside pens are used to maintain the majority of the animals and can hold an average of 200 animals per pen. These pens have large movable hay mangers. The inside pens are used to segregate horses that have just been unloaded from gathers, for loads being shipped out, sick and/or injured animals as well as horses with special needs (i.e. to separate studs, mares, mares with foals and young horses). These smaller pens have permanent hay mangers. It is anticipated that the feeding services for the wild horses and burros will require at least two contract personnel on a daily basis.  Since this facility does not have an automated feeding system, one of the Contractor's employees shall drive the BLM furnished truck and tractor, and the other Contractor employee shall break up the square bales of hay and place them by hand into the hay mangers. A site visit has been scheduled for February 24, 2005 at 10:00 A.M. Attendees will meet with John Neill (775) 475-2222 at the BLM Palomino Valley Wild Horse Center, 15780 SR 445, Reno, NV 89510.This is a 100% set-aside for small business. The standard NAICS classification is 115210. Size standard is $6 million. Solicitation NAR050028 will be available at http://www.fedbizopps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about February 2, 2005.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals shall be sent to (303) 236-9421. Electronic proposals shall be sent to steven_santoro@blm.gov. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered eligible for award.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Descriptiuon for the FMU-143B/B Fuze System: The FMU-143B/B Fuze System is an electromechanical fuze system that provides impact delay detonation for penetrating warheads. The fuze contains an explosive train, which is mechanically and electrically out-of-line until specific weapon launch cycle event s have occurred. Once a valid launch has occurred, the fuze will arm in the selected arm time. The B/B configuration has a selectable arm time of 5.5 and 12 seconds. It has a fixed detonation delay after impact of 60 milliseconds. The fuze is powered by an  air-driven turbine generator power supply called the FZU-32 fuze initiator. The initiator is non-explosive and has no specific safety requirements.      The FMU-143 fuze system is comprised of the following elements: (1)basic fuze with arming and safety pins attached (2)a fuze aft mounting retainer (3)a retractile cable assembly (4)a swivel and clip assembly (5)a FZU-32 initiator  Two each of these five elements are included in each shipping container. The fuze is housed in an aluminum cylinder (with chem film finish), 8 in. long and 3 in. in diameter. The fuze is equipped with a safety release assembly (housing and safety release s haft), and a connector to accept operating power. The fuze has a screwdriver adjustable selector feature to select arming delay times. The fuze is threaded into the fuze well located at the aft end of the penetrator warhead. The retractile cable electrical ly connects the fuze, via an internal warhead conduit, to the FZU-32 initiator installed in the charging well approximately in the middle the warhead. The initiator is secured by the aft fuze mounting retainer.      Prior to operational use the fuze may be stored, transported worldwide, installed in a weapon, loaded on an aircraft, and flown during captive carriage without release.

SIPC will now be known as SIGINT Engineering Support Services (SESS), and will  be listed in PIXS under Solicitation Number 04R2003.  NASIC/DEST has scheduled a meeting with industry on 25-26 May 04 at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, Area A, Building 856, in Conference Room E202.  The  purpose of this meeting is to update industry with information on the status  of  the SIGINT Engineering Support Services (SESS) contract: 1) acquisition  strategy,  2) program plan, 3) performance requirements, 4) system demonstration concept,  and  5) draft source selection evaluation criteria.   Those contractors interested in participating in the SESS contract should plan  to attend 0800-1430 briefings on 25 May 04.  Tours will be conducted through  our existing laboratory facilities during the afternoon of the 25th.  We are  limiting each company to three participants.  On the 26th of May a question  and  answer session will be held.  For purposes of confidentiality, these sessions  are planned as private, one-hour, one-on-one sessions with each interested  contractor.  If your company is interested in having a one-on-one session with  the government, please contact Mr. Steve Myles, (937) 522-2406, email:  stephen.myles@wpafb.af.mil.    One hour time slots will be allocated by  lottery  and will not be firm until 22 May 04.  At that time, the representative can  ask  questions pertaining to SESS as well as supply feedback on: 1.	Acquisition strategy (contract type, incentives, etc.) 2.	Program plan 3.	Performance requirements 4.	System demonstration concept 5.	Draft Source Selection evaluation criteria Request your company representative(s) wishing to attend this Industry Day  register online via the MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.

<DESC>THE SOLICITATION NUMBER FOR THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN CHANGED  FROM:  GS06P05GZC0007(N)   TO:  GS06P05GZC0007.     NOTICES IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS PROJECT ARE NOW IDENTIFIED WITH SOLICITATION NUMBER GS06P05GZC0007.     ALL POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE DIRECTED TO THE NOTICE POSTED UNDER SOLICITATION NUMBER GS06P05GZC0007.        The project is a continuation of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building.  Approximately 188,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated award range is $20,000,000 to $30,000,000.  Completion time is 715 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about August 29, 2005.  This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the four state region  consisting of Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska; (2) meeting the minimum requirement of having worked on a similar or partially similar project  defined as an interior office renovation or other renovation project with a high level of interior finishes and complexity (new construction projects will not be evaluated); (3) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (4) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 11 through 14 and miscellaneous lobby work on floors 15, 16 and 18; and stairway tower upgrades on floors 11 through 18.  The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 13 and 14 initially will be vacant; floors 11 and 12 will be vacated when the tenants from those floors move to 13 and 14.  Base Bid contract work includes demolition, asbestos and lead paint abatement; tenant improvements consisting of new drywall partitions; ceiling replacement; new doors, frames and hardware; paint, plaster, and vinyl base; casework; building signage/graphics; new above ceiling HVAC; new lighting; floor box connections for office furniture; new panel boards; new power distribution and telephone and data raceway and drops.  Option Bid work includes tenant improvements; meeting certification standards to qualify for LEED certification; stairway egress and pressurization infrastructure improvements from floors 11-18; and Building Automation System work.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the trade-off process in selecting the prime contractor.  The trade-off process is a method of evaluating both the technical factors specified in the solicitation, the price and an optional in-person interview.  For this solicitation, the goal is to select the proposal that offers the best combination of technical qualifications, price and an optional interview.  The Government intends to award the contract to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, with technical factors being considered more important than price. The object is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price. Proposals will be evaluated in three stages.  Stage One, the Request for Technical Proposals (RFTP) will be issued on or about 01-24-05.  The RFTP will consist of technical evaluations to establish those within a competitive range. The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel, (3) Management Plan, and (4) Sustainable Construction Materials and Methods.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  Offerors whose proposals fall within the competitive range will be invited by the Government to make Stage Two submissions, which shall consist of Pricing, a subcontracting plan and special competency requirements. Offerors whose technical evaluations do not meet minimum requirements will be notified by phone or letter that they will not be allowed to submit a price proposal. Offerors whose technical evaluations are not in the competitive range will also be so notified; however their price proposals will still be received and evaluated. Pricing Packages will be issued on or about April 11, 2005.  Initial Price proposals will be received in this office on or about May 20, 2005. Offerors should submit Stage Two price proposals that are acceptable without additional information, as the Government may make the final determination regarding a proposals acceptability based solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed with the award of the contract without discussion. However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors. A request for final price proposals will be issued on or about May  29, 2005.  The offeror with the highest technical rank and the lowest price will be considered the most advantageous.  If the ranks of two or more offerors are approximately equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous. As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  If the selection board deems it necessary or desirable, they may invite selected firms to an in-person interview, which shall constitute Stage Three. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications, price and the interview, if held, that is the most advantageous to the Government. The Government will evaluate all proposals that meet the minimum requirements.  

THIS IS THE PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY.

Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications and drawings) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  The drawings are being provided as .DWF file.  Drawings can be viewed from Autodesk.  Bidders are responsible for producing their own print sets for their use.

PART 2  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATED TO HSTS04-05-R-DEP976 PRESOLICITATION NOTICE:


The following questions and Government answers are provided to provide clarity of this requirement to interested parties:


Question 1:  Is the one-page Notice of Interest due COB October 29, 2004?

Response to Question 1:  The original Due Date for receipt of the one-page Notice of Interest was 30 October.  The receipt time and date for one-page Notice of Interest response(s) is hereby revised to 4 PM Eastern Standard Time, November 3rd, 2004.  Notice of Interest must be received by the Contracting Officer at 590 Herndon Parkway, Suite 120, Herndon, VA  20170


Question 2:  May the Notice of Interest be sent electronically (email) to your attention?

Response to Question 2:  No. A hard copy of the Notice of Interest must be received by TSA Contracting Officer.  Address is re-affirmed in the Response to Question 1.


Question 3:  What is the current anticipated date for release of the solicitation (SOW) to the QVL pool?  Accordingly, what is the anticipated due date for proposals and award date for the various sections?

Response to Question 3:  The Statement of Work (SOW) will be released with the Request for Proposals after the QVL is established. The TSA anticipates competitive award(s) in the 1st Quarter of FY 2005. 


Question 4:  Specifically, personnel and pricing appear to be requested based on the evaluation criteria and the requirement for a GSA Federal Supply Schedule, but how do we present this information within the limitations of the one-page Notice of Interest?  Are you expecting labor categories to be provided, as well as on-site and off-site rates?

Response to Question 4: The announcement does not request pricing and personnel data at this time.  The announcement requirement for relevant past performance qualifications requires interested parties submitting a notice of interest to identify the value of cited past performance contracts.  This value will be used to assist TSA with determining how cited past performance compares to the anticipated scope of PMO requirements. 


Question  5:  What is the estimated contract value for each section or current contract value of services provided by incumbents?
 
Response to Question 5:  The requirements addressed within FEDBIZOPs announcement have been provided over the past five years by the following companies (total contract value estimated):

JIL Information Systems (Program Management Support) -- $24 million over past 5 years;
NGMS (Data Collection & Analysis, and ILS Support) -- $18 million over the past 5 years;
Battelle Memorial Inst. (IV&V Support) -- $33 million over past 5 years;
Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (Security Equipment Integration)  less than $5 million over past 5 years for engineering services portion of contract. 


Question 6:  In the PreSolicitation Notice excerpt below, the first sentence discusses CTO requirements, but the rest of the notice refers (numerous times) to PMO requirements.  I can find no CTO organization described on the DHS website, and wonder if that CTO should actually be PMO?  If CTO is correct, could you please provide a brief description or link to a description of that part of DHS?
 
Response to Question 6:  CTO refers to the Transportation Security Administration Office of Security which is headed by the Chief Technology Officer.  This requirement is for the Program Management Office (PMO) support services required by the CTO to support the TSA mission.  Recommend looking at TSA website for data on CTO. 


Question 7:  In order to know how many past performance examples to submit, would you please quantify the anticipated scope (personnel and price) of the "(1) Management Services" requirements?

Response to Question 7:  Historical size of requirement is identified in answer to Question #5. 


Question 8:  What is the preferred method of submittal, postal mail, email, or fax?  If you don not have a preferred method, we will most likely email it to you.

Response to Question 8:  Please see responses to Questions #1 and #2.


Question 9:  How do we get our Firm added to the Federal Business Opportunities email list?
 
Response to Question 9: TSA does not manage, control or influence the FEDBIZOPs process.  Therefore, any request for incorporation on a Federal Business Opportunities e-mail list must be addressed with FEDBIZOPs management.


Question 10:  Please provide the following incumbent information for the STDO PMO requirement(s):  Contractor; Incumbent Contract; and Expiration Date. 
 
Response to Question 10:  The response to Question #5 identifies incumbent names and estimated contract value (over a 5 year period).  The expiration date for all contracts is 31 December 2004.  Contract numbers are:

JIL Information:  DTFA01-98-C-01003

Question 16:  Reference the Presolicitation Notice for STDO PMO Support (HSTS04-05-R-DEP976), you are planning for 3 of the 6 contracts to be awarded to small businesses.

Could you please tell me what the NAICS code size standards are for the proposed small business set-asides

Response to Question 16:  Please see responses to Questions #13, and #14.

Question 17:  If our company bids a team do you want past performance quals from the subs?

Response to Question 17:  Each interested party that submits a notice of interest should identify the qualifications of their company.  If the company is proposing to use a key subcontractor, their notice of interest can address this.  


Question 18:  Can the 100% set aside offerors bid a team?

Response to Question 18:  Yes.


Question 19:  Are you able to be on multiple teams?

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620 This Modification, in its entirety, replaces Presolicitation Notice, RFQ-OH-05-00043 that was posted on January 24, 2005. In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106-1(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeks to award professional services on a sole  source basis to Gunther F. Craun and Associates based on the following circumstances outlined below that only one source is reasonably available. This requirement is to provide professional services to revise the report titled, "Using the Waterborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System to Estimate  the Waterborne Disease Burden in the United States."  This report identifies and quantifies the waterborne microbial disease outbreaks attributable to drinking water exposures in the U.S. from 1971 to 2000.  This report was originally developed by Gunther Craun and Associates and was submitted for  internal review by EPA peer reviewers in June, 2004.  This project will require the Contractor to prepare a Quality Assurance Project Plan, respond to internal peer review comments, attend an external peer review meeting, respond to resulting comments, and to revise the existing draft.  In  addition, the Contractor will be required to submit two additional reports.  The first report will estimate the waterborne disease burden using adjusted case estimates from reported drinking water outbreaks and the second report will describe a method for estimating the size and number of  unreported US waterborne infectious disease outbreaks.  The U.S. EPA-National Center for Environmental Assessment office  in Cincinnati, Ohio is only aware of one source that is reasonably available for this project.  Due to the confidentiality of the locations of the waterborne disease outbreaks,  access to the EPA/CDC Waterborne Disease Outbreak database is limited.  Gunther Craun and Associates has access to the database and has co-authored numerous manuscripts summarizing some of the data in the database.  In addition, Gunther Craun and Associates has established and developed a detailed  set of ancillary data for many of these outbreaks; this ancillary information, which supplements the information in the EPA/CDC database, is critical to the development of the Waterborne Disease Burden project.  This project is due to be completed in July, FY'06.  The unique experience and  capabilities that Gunther Craun and Associates possess are essential to the timely completion of this project.   Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to perform the services described above, should provide a capabilities statement demonstrating how their qualifications,  experience, and ability to access the EPA/CDC database fulfill the Government's requirement.  A statement of work and any other applicable documents will be made available upon request.   The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining  whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.   Please send your documentation to Kimberli Irwin at the office identified above, by fax (513)487-2109 or by e-mail at (irwin.kimberli@epa.gov) which establishes that their specifications or qualifications meet the EPA's requirement.   Documentation must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the EPA.  A determination by the EPA not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>Engineers at the Idaho National Laboratory in the National Security Program have developed and successfully demonstrated the "Idaho Integrated Breaching Shotgun" for law enforcement agencies and the military.  The " Idaho Integrated Breaching Shotgun" combines into a single weapon a shotgun for destroying door hinges or locks during a rapid, forced entry, with the traditional automatic rifle for returning gunfire.  Engineers have designed the breaching shotgun to fit under the barrel of the rifle.  They made several modifications to the shotgun's operation so that officers can use either weapon without repositioning their hands to reach the triggers, thereby giving them split-second use of either weapon.  Also, they redesigned the shotgun to deliver more energy from the shell as it exits the barrel, making the shotgun more effective for forced entries.

For companies interested in commercializing the "Idaho Integrated Breaching Shotgun" please contact: Tom Harrison, Consulting Account Executive, Technology Outreach, at the Idaho National Laboratory.  Telephone: (208) 526-1710 E-mail: harrtm@inel.gov.

The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (Large Business, HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, and Small Disadvantage Business) relative to the NAICS Codes.

Project Title: Relating Mental Health Concerns to the Entertainment Industry:  Education, Resources and Recognition  The Art of Making a Difference 

Project Description:  The goal of this project is to utilize the massive communications potential of the entertainment industry to help the general public better understand what mental health and mental illness mean, and then to break down the related stigma.  The purpose of this project is to build on the 10 years of work that the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) has done with the entertainment industry in the creation, development and implementation of the annual PRISM awards, which recognize the accurate depiction of substance abuse and addiction through media and entertainment production.  The focus of this procurement will be to inform and engage the creative community on important mental health issues such as suicide prevention, the accurate and non stigmatizing depiction of mental illness, the possibilities of recovery and information about the prevention of mental and behavioral disorders and the promotion of mental health.  In order to inform the public about mental health through entertainment, it is necessary to first inform the creators of entertainment and those who make the decisions about what is produced and aired.

The contractor will work with the Center for Mental Health Services in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (CMHS/SAMHSA) and the National Institute of Mental Health at the National Institutes of Health (NIMH/NIH)  to develop the resources needed to inform writers, directors, producers, and other talented people about why it is so important to deal with mental health-related issues in their productions, and help them to find ways that this can be achieved in a compelling, entertaining way with accurate portrayals. 

Furthermore, your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 10 pages (font size 10 or larger).  In addition, a copy of the company capability statement will be accepted. Responses are due February 11, 2005. The anticipated period of performance is 5 years, 12 month per contract period. After review of the responses received a solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities around on before March 2005.

If not, please detail the time and resources that you would need to develop and establish such a resource within the entertainment industry, giving specific examples of how the website would become known to a large number of entertainment professionals.
10)Do you have the ability to procure and maintain a database of significant and up-to-date contacts from the entertainment industrys creative and executive professional fields?  If so, please detail what is currently available and how you will use this contact list to communicate information about mental health developed as a part of this project to the entertainment industry.
11)Do you have the ability and resources to design and implement a competitive program that recognizes entertainment industry professionals for accurately depicting health and social issues?  Included in this process are: Design and delivery of a Call for Entry form; a scientific judging process for evaluating the merit of all entries, holding them to the highest scientific standard; a proven process for selecting and bringing together judges from the science and research realm of the mental health field; a high-profile process by which entertainment professionals will be recognized for their outstanding efforts and accomplishments in regard to the projects goal of highlighting merit-worthy television, film and music productions that address mental health issues in an accurate manner, that will encourage their peers to create equally creditable productions out of a sense of professional competition and social responsibility.
12)Do you have the resources to develop (including the research, writing, review by scientific experts and publication and dissemination of) a comprehensive resource book on mental health-related issues?
13)Do you have the resources to orient non-entertainment science-based experts on your process including, importantly, various aspects of the entertainment industrys mechanism, in order to best accomplish the goals and objectives of this project?

<DESC>The USAF is conducting market research regarding transient alert services to determine whether or not the services can be classed as commercial in nature and if so, the contractual terms and conditions common to such commercial contracts.  You can help us with this research by answering the following questions.  Any information you provide will be kept entirely confidential and is not for the purpose of pre-qualifying contractors.



Market research questions:

1.  For what non-federal or non-DOD entities does (or has) your company provide(d) transient alert services?  Include state, municipal, or other local government entities, as well as non-government entities.  If possible, provide a copy of the terms and conditions of the contract, or provide contact information where we can obtain information regarding the terms and conditions.

2.  If you are considering competing for this contract, what types of information will facilitate your ability to develop a competitive, fixed-price offer (nature of information and degree/quantity)?  What risks would make it difficult for you to develop such an offer?

3.  If your company normally provides transient alert services and has decided not to compete for this contract, what constraints within USAF control contributed to the decision?

<DESC>Market Survey for Desktop, Laptop, Server, Printer Suppliers and their Subcomponent Suppliers Based on the Draft EPEAT Criteria NOTE: Vendors who are attending the Department of the Interior's IT Hardware Vendor's Day on 2/9 and 2/10, 2005 at the USGS facility in Reston, VA. Phone 703 648 6828. Vendorsare encouraged to bring their responses to this Market Survey to Vendor's Day.  All others may email your response to Catherine_Cesnik@ios.doi.gov with a cc: to John_Sherman@blm.gov by February 15, 2005. BACKGROUND In the initial Consolidated DOI IT Hardware procurement for desktops, laptops, and servers, DOI stated its intention to include greening requirements in the recompetition of these awards.  In November of 2004 the Department of the Interior (DOI) along with eleven other federal agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding to join the Federal Electronics Challenge (FEC) lead by EPA. FEC partner agencies try to reduce the environmental impacts and agency environmental liability by purchasing "green" electronic products, properly disposing electronics, etc. For more information, please visit http://www.federalelectronicschallenge.net/  The following Market Survey Questions are based on the Draft Electronic Procurement Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) criteria created by the FEC. This market survey will give the Department of the Interior (DOI) an indication of when manufacturers will be able to provide products consistent with the EPEAT criteria. DOI plans to have future DOI purchases be consistent with the final EPEAT criteria when they are available.  Please answer the following questions to the best of your ability for all product lines for which you may submit a bid to DOI. In particular, please focus on desktop computers, laptop computers, servers, printers and their subcomponent suppliers.  GENERAL 1.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command Aircraft Division (NAVAIR-AD), Special Communications Requirements (SCR) Division, St. Inigoes, MD is seeking to identify all responsible sources capable of providing a generator crossover and control unit.  The unit is intended for use with two, redundant 6-8 KVA generator sets supplying 120 VAC @ 60 Hz. They should be able to provide the capability to establish and maintain mobile fixed Command and Control (C2) communications from any level within a theater of operations and the capability to rapidly transmit data seamlessly between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters.  GENERATOR CROSSOVER AND CONTROL UNIT REQUIREMENTS  PARAMETER / SPECIFICATION: This power control unit will accept connections from the generator sets to allow for make-before-break crossover operation between the two attached generators and a third, commercial-source power input.  Therefore, the selected power control unit must be capable of externally controlling the throttle of the generator sets, to allow for generator output synchronization as part of the make-before-break crossover.  The selected power control unit must also provide current and voltage meters to show input and output power conditions.  Selection between the three input sources will be made manually.  This generator crossover and control unit must support a momentary load of 7800 VA (120V at 65A) with the ability to continuously support 6000 VA (50A).  The output load should be split between three 20A connections.  Outputs should be circuit breaker protected, high amperage panel-mounted socket connectors.  It should support three-wire connection (Hot, Neutral, and Ground for single-phase power) with a grounding lug provided on the generator chassis for a safety-ground connection. There should also be a master circuit breaker to protect the input.  The power control unit must be capable of continuous operation for at least 30 days.  Manufacturers are encouraged to review the Sources Sought Notice for the Generator Sets, which is N00421-05-TBD01.  Solutions combining the two capabilities/functions will be given preference.  MECHANICAL SPECIFICATIONS: The power control unit should be mounted within an equipment transit case, and weigh less than 174 pounds total, with power control unit and case included. Or capable of being mounted with a 19-inch wide, 24-inch deep IEEE equipment rack of not more than 10 rack-units in height (17.5 inches).  If the transit case is included and is larger than 7 rack units in height than it will have two sets of carry handles mounted in parallel on each side. If the prospective manufacture includes a wheeled dolly, it must be capable of operation over uneven and grassy ground as well as smooth, hard pavement/floors.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Proposed TRICARE Active Duty Dental Program (RFI)
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION TO GAIN INTEREST IN A POSSIBLE FUTURE TRICARE CONTRACT FROM OFFERORS WHO ALREADY HAVE A FULLY DEVELOPED NATIONAL DENTAL PROVIDER NETWORK.

The Department of Defense is interested in contracting for the processing and payment of dental claims for Active Duty Service Members (ADSMs) residing within the United States and its territories. A potential offeror must tender its current nation-wide dental network of credentialed providers to the Program and its proposed network fee schedule.  However, in remote locations, claims from non-network providers will be submitted for payment.  All claims will be preauthorized by Government personnel prior to payment. The dental benefit structure will include a full-spectrum of possible dental procedures; however, the contractor will pay claims based solely on the specified procedures in the authorizations and will make no benefit determinations. The contractor must be able to pay for a wide range of benefits, both routine and specialty care.  Authorizations may be received by fax or by other preferable electronic means to be determined.  The contractor must have the ability to accept claim forms via paper and electronic formats to include the dental ANSI X12N 837.  Extensive DoD IT security requirements (DITSCAP) may have to be met by the contractor.  Benefit payments will be drawn from an account established specifically for this program and the contractor will be given authority to draw funds from that bank account. The volume of dental claims paid for authorized civilian dental care in CY2004 was 158,866. 

If you are interested and wish to receive any further notices regarding the contracting of Active Duty Dental claims, submit the name of your company, address and a point of contact to include telephone number and e-mail address.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Multinational Experiment 4 Information Technology  Tools
<DESC>This synopsis is to announce a U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) request for information (RFI) on software and hardware tools which offer potential to support the execution of Multinational Experiment 4 (MNE4).  Combatant Commanders have repeatedly identified the need to conduct collaborative operational planning with coalition partners, and government and non-government agencies.  USJFCOM has been directed to explore options and formulate recommendations for military transformation.  USJFCOM Experimentation Directorate J9 is conducting concept development for the Effects Based Operations (EBO) capability by establishing an environment for multinational experimentation with EBO.

The emerging EBO process requires certain technical tools to assist operational planners, operators, and assessors to conduct business in the collaborative environment and with multiple levels of security.  To accomplish EBO, planners will be required to share a common knowledge base, collaborate during planning and execution, and share assessments of current operations.    

Software and hardware solutions to support MNE4, the current spiral within the overall multinational EBO concept development, will be required to support collaborative planning, commander/director visualization of the operation across spatial and temporal domains, effects-action-resource optimization, and modeling of the operational environment.  These tools will be required to be available to all participants in MNE4 which include:

·	Australia
·	Canada
·	Finland
·	France
·	Germany
·	Sweden
·	United Kingdom
·	United States
·	North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)

MNE4 is not in and of itself an end user product.  It is the concept of establishing an environment that facilitates the seamless flow of information between coalition partners within a common operational environment while reducing or eliminating obstacles that inhibit information flow. 

The USJFCOM is seeking technologies which will assist the EBO knowledge base development, planning, execution, and assessment process as described in the focus areas identified below.  The tools and technologies will operate on an isolated network certified to operate and process classified information among the multinational participants.  The required security guidelines, cryptographic devices, and architectures required for certification will be used. 

PROCESS FOCUS AREAS

KNOWLEDGE BASE DEVELOPMENT

The Knowledge Base Development (KBD) to enable EBO contains all the requisite knowledge and data to conduct the operation across the diplomatic, informational, military, and economic (DIME) capabilities.  It enables situational awareness and understanding (SA/SU).  It includes a collaboration capability, a system of systems analysis (SoSA), analysis by various Centers of Excellence (COE), the collaborative information environment (to include legacy CROP features), operational guidance from the nations, joint headquarters, relevant agencies, and their operational orders and directives.

EFFECTS BASED PLANNING

Effects Based Planning (EBP) to execute EBO begins with situation awareness/situational understanding (SA/SU) gained from the knowledge base.  Using the Commanders initial guidance, it examines the operational objectives, versus adversary and neutral organizations aims, to derive diplomatic, informational, military, and economic (DIME) effects to achieve the desired end state.  From the desired effects to achieve the endstate, action-resource matching occurs in order to develop the operational plan and draft synchronization matrix.  Adaptive planning is therefore enabled.  The draft synchronization matrix is wargamed and adjusted during synchronization and plan refinement.  An effects based assessment plan is developed and EBP concludes with the publishing of an Effects Tasking Order (ETO).

EFFECTS BASED EXECUTION

Effects-Based Execution (EBE) enables the coalition staff to execute and monitor the operation and integrate DIME actions.  A command and control capability is able to draw information from effects based assessment and adapt current operations and resources in real-time. Information push-pull capabilities enable the coalition to adapt in near-real-time to meet all operational conditions. 

EFFECTS BASED ASSESSMENT

Effects-Based Assessment (EBA) enables adaptive planning and execution by providing assessments of effectiveness of actions and resources.  It facilitates the coalitions use of measures of effectiveness (MOE) and measures of performance (MOP) of DIME actions to accomplish the operational objectives.  Additionally, risk assessment, traditional measures of damage assessment, and an independent assessment of progress toward achieving the end state will inform the knowledge base (KBD) and update the system of systems analyses (SoSA). 

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

General technical and format requirements:

·	Must be open standard
·	.JSP instead of .ASP
·	J2EE/Java instead of C# or .net
·	Standard SQL instead of MS SQL
·	Web enabled with server side execution to avoid client software installs
·	Single Sign On (SSO) specifically to support open LDAP user authentication  
·	Use by multiple operating systems and web browsers
·	XML or more capable standard format for knowledge base documentation and data exchange

General tool architectures to support the following requirements: 

·	The collaborative information environment (CIE) workspace
·	The knowledge base (KB) display, editing, search, & publishing capability.  
·	Collaborative Information Environment (CIE) and Common Relevant Operational Picture (CROP) visualization aid and data storage to support planning and operations. 
·	The system of systems analysis (SoSA) which models political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information system relationships. Visualization of KB architecture, effect-action-resource relationships, MOE, MOP, temporal, and spatial operations and assessment displays
·	A synchronization matrix planning tool to allow a broad visualization of the effects-based plan across the DIME.  The tool will be the experiment centerpiece planning aid to assist development and execution of an effects-based campaign.  It is desired to be a visual matrix display depicting the relationships and dependencies between desired effects, planned actions, and their associated resources as a function of time and space. The tool should also facilitate the planning and visualization of the Commanders Approved Effects List (CAEL) and relevant mission orders, resources, and communications relationships. A pull-down menu of common DIME effects is desired to facilitate operational planner efficiencies and also allow manual entry of new effects for future use. Version control will be required in order to compare several versions of the synchronization matrix to enable optimum course of action (COA) selection. 
·	Tools which support the assessment process, execution, and complement capabilities for the synchronization tool described in the bullet above.  The assessment tools may include pre-formatted MOE and MOP charts and graphs, use Bayesian statistics, decision trees, or other quantitative and qualitative methods.
·	GIS (geospatial information systems) data storage and associated raster maps, vector layers, and information overlays from the KB for proper geospatial representation. Open GIS data is expected to be stored on all coalition servers to minimize network bandwidth requirements.  

Additional tool concepts which JFCOM and MNE4 are eager to explore: 

·	DIME action-reaction modeling and simulation and analysis tools
·	Course of Action (COA) selection and decision aids
·	Deployment and sustainment tracking, analysis, and modeling
·	Visualization aids to include directories to sources of information, link-node analysis, Gantt/Pert charts and the ability to use these aids in the collaborative environment
·	Search engines and web crawlers to facilitate research across the DIME
·	Cross-domain search capabilities with multiple levels of security and/or configurable security firewalls
·	Tools useful for humanitarian relief and emergency response
·	Information push-pull tools and technologies for near real-time operational applications 
·	Information push-pull tools for pre-formatting messages and orders
·	Tools and technologies that facilitate interoperability across government, state and local officials, and non-governmental agencies

This request is for information only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on a basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for information solicited.  No entitlement to payment or direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government may arise as a result of the submission of information by industry.

Statement of Work
for
Nitrosamine Measurement for Four Lab Chlorination Study

General

	The contractor shall perform chemical analyses (for the 8 nitrosamines listed below) on drinking water samples for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Exposure Research Laboratory, Ecosystems Research Division, 960 College Station Road, Athens GA  30605-2700.  The government will provide a total of 40 samples for this project over a period of approximately 7 months.  This work is part of a collaborative project called the Four Lab Chlorination Study, which involves chlorination treatment of drinking water, concentration of this drinking water, chemical analysis of disinfection by-products (DBPs) formed in the water, and toxicological study of the drinking water concentrates.  This contract will be to carry out the chemical analysis of 8 nitrosamines for this project.  As part of this project, there will be the following activities:

(1) The Trial Run.  
A Trial Run will be carried out initially to assess the ability of reverse osmosis concentration to successfully concentrate DBPs with the specific water to be studied.  Two Trial Run experiments would be sampled for nitrosamines, for a total of 12 samples.

(2) Nitrosamine Stability Study (Optional).
If nitrosamines are found in water samples during the Trial Run, a Nitrosamine Stability Study will be carried out during the Trial Run to determine the stability of DBPs in the concentrates over 14-day ideal storage conditions (4oC in the dark) and limited on-cage/off-cage conditions (animal cage conditions at room temperaturecarried out at the U.S. EPA Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory in RTP, NC).  The latter water samples would be provided to the contractor after storage on the animal cages.  A total of 16 samples would be analyzed for this Stability Study (if carried out).

(3) The Full Study.  
The Full Study will involve a minimum of 2 concentration events of treated drinking water and will involve the measurement of the listed nitrosamine DBPs in unconcentrated and concentrated waters that would be used in toxicity testing.  A minimum of 12 samples would be analyzed for the Full Study.  If the Nitrosamine Stability Study is not carried out, then additional concentration events will be sampled for nitrosamines, for a total of 28 samples.

There will be 3 types of water samples analyzed:  (1) the treated, unconcentrated water (1x water); (2) the treated-concentrated water; and (3) the raw water concentrates (used as a control).  

All data will be entered by the contractor into an Excel data entry form that will be provided by the U.S. EPA.

Government Furnished Items

 The government will provide water samples collected and stored in appropriate containers.  The government will provide an Excel data entry form for data entry by the contractor.


Specific Tasks

	The contractor shall perform chemical analyses on drinking water samples (1x treated water, treated water concentrates, and raw water concentrates).  The contractor shall provide concentration data for the 8 listed nitrosamines for the 1x treated water, treated water concentrates, and raw water concentrates.  A total of 40 samples shall be analyzed.  There will be 3 main tasks associated with this contract:

Task 1.  The Trial Run

A Trial Run will be carried out to assess the success of the concentration effort and will be conducted over a March-May 2005 timeframe.  The contractor shall measure the 8 nitrosamines (see list below) in the 1x treated water, the treated-concentrated water, and the concentrated raw water.  Duplicate samples of each shall be analyzed (total of 6 per Trial Run experiment).  The 1x treated water will be shipped overnight to the contractor for analysis while the concentration effort is taking place.  The water concentrates will be shipped overnight to the contractor upon completion of the concentration process (anticipated 1-2 days after the 1x water samples).  Data for these analytes shall be provided to the U.S. EPA within 10 working days of receipt of the water concentrates.  Data shall be entered by the contractor into an Excel data entry form provided by the U.S. EPA.  

Two Trial Run experiments are expected, for a total of 12 samples. 

Task 2.  Nitrosamine Stability Study (Optional)

If the nitrosamines are found in the treated concentrates during the Trial Run, a Nitrosamine Stability Study shall be carried out during the Trial Run to determine the stability of the nitrosamines in the concentrates over 14-day ideal storage conditions (4oC in the dark) and limited on-cage/off-cage conditions (animal cage conditions at room temperaturecarried out at the U.S. EPA Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory in RTP, NC).  Water concentrates containing DBPs would be provided to the contractor on the following schedule:  (1) Day One on-cage (as water bottles are initially filled on the animal cages); (2) Day Two off-cage (as remaining water is collected off the animal cages); (3) Day 6 on-cage (as water bottles are filled with fresh water that was stored at 4oC in the dark); (4) Day 7 off-cage; (5) Day 14 on-cage; (6) Day 15 off-cage  (2 duplicates for each sampling, total of 12 samples).  Data shall be provided to the U.S. EPA within 10 working days.  Data shall be entered by the contractor into an Excel data entry form provided by the U.S. EPA.  

If most nitrosamines are stable, a second stability check shall be made after 20 days storage (2 duplicates under ideal storage conditions and 2 duplicates stored at room temperature on animal cages).  Data shall be provided to the U.S. EPA within 10 working days.  Data shall be entered by the contractor into an Excel data entry form provided by the U.S. EPA.  Grand total samples for Nitrosamine Stability Study (if carried out):  16 samples.  

	Note:  If nitrosamines are not found in treated concentrates during the Trial Run, the 16 samples allocated for this Stability Study would be instead analyzed during the Full Study.  

Task 3.  The Full Study

The Full Study will involve several concentration events of treated drinking water.  This contract would involve the measurement of the 8 listed nitrosamines in water samples from selected concentration events (2 concentration events if the Nitrosamine Stability Study is carried out during the Trial Run, and 4 concentration events if the Nitrosamine Stability Study measurements are not carried out).  The Full Study will begin between June and September and will end 20-22 weeks later.  A minimum of two-weeks notice will be given to the contractor for the scheduled starting date of the Full Study (first concentration event) and for the additional sampling dates (later concentration events).  Measurements shall be carried out as in the Trial Run (including measurement of 1x treated water, treated-concentrated water, and concentrated raw water).  Data shall be provided within 4 working weeks of receipt of the water concentrates.  Data shall be entered by the contractor into an Excel data entry form provided by the U.S. EPA.  A minimum of 2 concentration events will be sampled for nitrosamines, for a total of 12 samples (if previous Nitrosamine Stability Study is carried out).  If the Nitrosamine Stability Study is not carried out, then additional concentration events will be sampled for nitrosamines, for a total of 28 samples.   (12 to 28 samples total).

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address potential offerors questions.

Question 1:	Where will the controller be located in proximity to the tower?

Answer to Question 1:	The hand controller will be used primarily for system integration and setup.  It will most likely not be used during normal operations.  For integration purposes, the hand controller will either plug directly into the payload (when unmounted) or will be connected via an extension cable down to the trailer platform.

Question 2:	 Do you require each camera to have a separate controller or will all three cameras be controlled by one unit located at some central facility?

Answer to Question 2:	The camera positions themselves will not be manned.  All three cameras will be controlled via wireless network from a single command post.   This post will provide camera control and monitoring. Multiple users on the network will have the capability to control the cameras on a prioritized basis. 

Question 3:	Are monitors required as part of this solicitation.  If so, what type of monitors?  IE, 19"rack mounted, LCD, etc..... 

Answer to Question 3:	Monitors are not required as part of this solicitation.  If a system levies particular requirements on a monitor (i.e. touch screen, etc) these must be stated in the proposal.

Question 4:	What is the desired range performance of the camera?

Answer to Question 4:	It is desired that the camera system be able to detect a 122mm rocket launch plume at a distance of 20km.

Question 5:	Is a double field of view (DVOF) preferred or will a single field of view be acceptable?

Answer to Question 5:	A DFOV or greater field of view is required.

Question 6:	What is the ideal resolution of the camera?

Answer to Question 6:	320x240 pixels is the minimum, 640x480 is desired.

Question 7:     Can contractors propose GSA Schedule items?

Answer to Question 7:   GSA Chedule offers will be evaluated.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1  TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR STRAIN AND MOTION ANALYSIS SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to Answer questions asked before the due date of proposals. 1. Question:  Will the shearography system work with the high speed camera?  Do you want to measure the deformations and deflections of the structures during the firing test?  Or do you want a more ordinary EPSI or shearography system? Answer: The shearography system will not be used with the high-speed video.  It will be used with a 2 watt solid state laser that is supplied with the system.	The shearography will not be used during the firing tests but may be required to support some investigative testing on the frangible nuts or hold-down studs.  Two measurements from the high-speed video will shoot during the firing tests.  This data will be post processed from 10 high-speed digital video cameras.  One measurement to be performed is to quantify strain information from the frangible nut while the explosive charge is fracturing the nut.  The other measurement to be performed will be to track the nut halves as they move away after fracture.  This tracking information will include trajectory and velocity plots. 2. Question:  What kind of installation timeline is required? Answer:  The successful vendor will be on site for 2 weeks to operate the system for our first series of tests and train one of our engineers in the use of the system.	The testing will begin February 7 so every piece of hardware must be shipped in and processed through our property management system to support that date. The due date for receipt of offers  is not extended.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on January 25, 2005. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on the basis of Price and Technical acceptability equally.  Past Performance and delivery Schedule will be factors of consideration. The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the ability to meet specification acceptability (offeror shall include detailed product description that highlights specifications and qualifications) delivery schedule, and price.  Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  Past performance will be considered, although of lesser importance than the delivery schedule, price and technical elements of the proposal.  Offerors should provide references for other contracts and/or subcontracts for items of similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 2 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (include email address and phone number of references).  Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the quote.  Offerors must state whether they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements.
