<DESC>DESCRIPTION.
<p>Effective 31 March 2008, FAR was amended to delete all references to Numbered Notes in Federal Business Opportunities.</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site (AFRL Rome), has a requirement focusing on enabling the Air Force mission to perform Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and Research and Development (R&amp;D) under an AFRL, Rome Research Site, RIE Division, Rome, NY contract. This effort:</p>
<p><br />1) Performs operations and maintenance, research and development, and intelligence production support to enhance, maintain, modernize, extend the capabilities of, operate and utilize the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) AVIPSS. AVIPSS is designed to meet NASIC mission requirements. The effort is a part of an AFRL/RI enhancement, sustainment, and research and development program to deliver services and capabilities required to satisfy the demands of a continually changing production mission at NASIC in response to ever-evolving threats in an equally dynamic technological environment.</p>
<p><br />2) Provides the information technology solution to achieve NASIC corporate objectives for pre-positioning its analytical knowledge and enabling customers and intelligence analysts to build current, accurate and robust intelligence products. The effort will include the: research and development of parametric information models; design of physical and logical database structures; development of capabilities to interactively maintain data within the databases; implementation of the capabilities necessary to derive tailored specialized products from the textual and parametric databases and multimedia object repositories; design of high level constructs that dynamically incorporate database information into knowledge-oriented objects; and the development, implementation and maintenance of customer friendly software applications/tools and interfaces; as specified in Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p><br />The AVIPSS consists of the Systematic Architecture for Virtual Analytic Net-Centric Threat Intelligence (SAVANT<sup>TM</sup>) system, the Next Generation Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR) System (NGES), the Foreign Media Collaboration Framework (FMCF) and its extensions and additional architecture and legacy infrastructure, analysis and information systems. Major components of the SAVANT<sup>TM</sup> are the: Knowledge Management Map and related applications and tools; the Knowledge Pre-positioning System (KPS); Virtual Production System (VPS); Virtual Intelligence Product Retrieval Environment (VIPRE); the NASIC Metadata Repository (NMR); and the Joint Analytic Data Editor (JADE). Support shall be provided for the systems including (but not limited to): Analyst Support Architecture (ASA); Ballistic Missile Information System (BMIS); Digital Library Input Processing System (DLIPS); Foreign Military Laser Database (FMLD); Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) Portal; Tactics and Training, Track Military Entities (TrackME); Data Tracker; Production Operations Management Information Systems (PROMIS); GlobalEdge; Military Equipment Parametric Engineering Database (MEPED); Dynamic Information Operations Decision Environment (DIODE); ArcGIS; RAVEN; MALWARE; Directed Energy Weapons/Global Laser Incident Database and Event Reporting (DEW/GLIDER); Space mission area products; Acquisition Log Database (ALDB); Information Technology Requirements Database (ITRD); Links and Nodes (L&amp;N); TEL-SCOPE telecommunications network; SAVANTTM Cross Domain Data Migration system; Space related databases; Space mission area products; and SharePoint Open Source Portal.</p>
<p><br />3) The design and implementation of software enhancements and maintenance of databases and applications that are used in the management of NASIC intelligence production, computer, personnel, physical and operations security, civilian and military personnel, training, all-source collections requirements and other technical tasks that keep NASIC systems functioning will also be supported as specified in the PWS. Further, this effort will support the research and development, enhancement, implementation and maintenance of national level systems for the input, translation, and retrieval of all-source information and for the continued design, development, implementation, and deployment of a DODIIS-wide information notification system as specified in the PWS. Future mission requirements changes are also expected, including deployments to new locations and customers, which historically require additional enhancements other than those which will be identified in the solicitation. Potential research and development transition opportunities are also anticipated, but not yet identified.</p>
<p><br />Anticipated deliverables include software, technical reports, software baseline documentation, security documentation, financial and progress reports, technical papers and analysis, presentations, and work plans. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) - Completion type contract with a period of performance of thirty (30) months is anticipated.

<p>This announcement constitutes a Notice of Proposed Contract Action (NOCA), by the Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Battle Management Directorate, Space and Nuclear Networks (SNND) Division, Hanscom AFB, MA, for a noncompetitive contract for the CSEL CLS Follow-On effort to be negotiated with The Boeing Company of the United States. The CSEL Program is an ACAT III, post-milestone C program. CSEL is an end to end survival radio system composed of three segments: a user segment that includes a hand-held radio (HHR), an over-the-horizon segment for satellite communications (OTH), and a ground segment consisting of multiple Command, Control, and Communications (C3) workstations (RSA) located in Joint Personnel Rescue Centers (JPRCs). The three CSEL system segments collectively provide global communications (including worldwide secure, two-way data communications) between an isolated person (IP) and personnel recovery elements. The CSEL radio provides survivor location and authentication by passing individual identification codes, geo-positioning information obtained from GPS satellites, and both predetermined and free text messages over the horizon via UHF or national systems. CSEL is a 15-year-old joint program utilized by the US Army, Navy, and Air Force. The maintenance and repair support for HHRs is conducted at Boeings supplier production facility. Boeing also utilizes other Boeing-owned and Government furnished test equipment and fixtures. The Government does not possess a second set of GFP to provide to another contractor and will not be able to transfer the equipment to a new contractor at the time that the follow on contract is awarded.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for a proposed contract, IAW FAR 5.201(b)(i), for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>Please direct any question regarding this synopsis to Capt J. Axel Clark, Contracting Officer, (781) 271-3524 or Capt Paul Park, Contract Specialist, (781) 271-7186.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). Nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The information you provide may be evaluated to identify qualified potential offerors. ESC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information marked with a proprietary legend without the written permission from the respondent. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to ESC.</p>
<p>An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution. In addition, AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract.

<DESC>The government intends to award a sole source award to Axiam:
<p>Product/Service Description</p>
<p>This requirement is for the licensing fee for the Smartstack<sup>TM</sup> software currently installed on Axiam GMS Series 4000 machines.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Axiam GMS Series 4000 machines and associated software and hardware enable the user to accurately measure various jet engine rotating components. These measurements are then used to orient the measured components in such a way as to minimize eccentricities and flatness measurements. Poorly stacked rotors will cause excessive vibration, reduce bearing life leading to less engine time on wing. The Axiam systems are available for use three shifts per day. The weapon system supports the B-52, C-135, E-3, F-15, B-1, B-2, and F-16 aircraft. This request is a request for a follow on contract.</p>
<p>Axiam, Inc is the original equipment manufacturer for the subject equipment. Axiam has proprietary rights to the software, technology and replacement parts to the GMS Series 4000 hardware as well as at least one patent related to the same equipment. Axiam, Inc is the only known company that has the technical expertise and data to maintain the GMS Series 4000 systems.</p>
<p><br />SUMMARY OF REQUIRED SERVICES</p>
<p>The contractor must have unlimited rights to the proprietary Axiam software. The Axiam system as well as the Smartstack<sup>TM</sup> software is available to the commercial sector only through Axiam, Inc. and is not military unique. The Axiam systems are already installed and in use by the Government.</p>

<CONTACT>Nathan Johnson, Email nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>AG-6395-S-12-0027 UGMA Moisture Meters Purchase<br />USDA, GIPSA Technology and Science Division
<p>Background</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture operates a laboratory in a privately-owned building: 10383 North Ambassador Drive, Kansas City Missouri 64153. The laboratory operates under the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), Technology and Science Division (TSD).</p>
<p>The USDA GIPSA Technology and Science Division is responsible for maintaining the reference methods for all official services provided by GIPSA to facilitate the marketing of grain. It is also responsible for developing and maintaining methods for accurately predicting the quality of grain and grain products moving through the U.S. marketplace. In order to provide the highest quality service needed to minimize variability in the testing methods, GIPSA has standardized to specific methods and/or equipment within the Official Inspection Service. Only these specific methods/equipment can be used by any entity providing testing service as either a GIPSA lab, an official agency, or State that is designated or delegated to perform work on behalf of GIPSA.</p>
<p>Measuring moisture content in grain is a critical factor for official inspection. To obtain accurate, repeatable, and fast results required for official grain inspection, GIPSA has long used moisture meter technology. Currently GIPSA is using Dickey-john's GAC2100 as the exclusively allowed moisture meter within the Official Inspection system. This instrument has been in use for over 10 years and is at the end of its lifespan. The GAC2100 requires maintenance of separate calibrations for each type of grain/oilseed which is a significant cost to GIPSA.</p>
<p>For many years GIPSA has conducted research into new technology to improve the accuracy and repeatability of grain moisture meter testing. The research found benefits to measuring at a higher radio frequency (about 149 MHz). The result is the development of the Unified Grain Moisture Algorithm (UGMA). GIPSA's research over multiple crop types and years showed that using the UGMA greatly improved the accuracy and precision of moisture results, reduced the "moisture rebound" effect associated with freshly harvested grain, and required only one calibration curve for all types of grains and oilseeds (though a few simple "unifying parameters" are required for each "grain group"). Basically the effects of variables such as sample temperature, geographic origin, variety, crop year, density and kernel moisture distribution are greatly reduced when using the UGMA technology.</p>
<p>During the course of the research, GIPSA has made information available and, when requested and Non-disclosure Agreements signed, provided assistance in developing UGMA-compatible instruments. GIPSA has been working directly (although confidentially) with several manufacturers. GIPSA's intent to standardize on this technology has been publicized for almost 10 years and GIPSA's Grain Inspection Advisory Committee was updated on the technology multiple times and has recommended proceeding in this technology.</p>
<p>Contract Scope/Deliverables</p>
<p>The two prime technical requirements for instruments are they MUST have NTEP-certification through GIPSA's TSD lab and they MUST be certified as UGMA-compatible through testing by our lab. UGMA-compatibility is crucial to permit the instruments to utilize GIPSA's UGMA calibrations and to give equivalent results to any other UGMA-compatible moisture meter.</p>
<p>GIPSA currently owns about 105 instruments that will need to be replaced. GIPSA intends to split the purchase among viable alternatives to ensure the continued availability of UGMA-compatible instruments from multiple sources. There are approximately an additional 500 known instruments needed by various agencies and entities which conduct grain sampling.</p>
<p>GIPSA requires delivery of instruments (around 100) by approximately June 1 to allow for full implementation by August 1, 2012.</p>
<p>Instruments would be shipped to multiple GIPSA locations throughout the United States</p>
<p>A one-year warranty is expected to be included for each instrument at no additional charge. The life cycle of the equipment is expected to be at least 10 years. Since the meters would have NTEP-certification and be certified as UGMA-compliant through testing in our lab, first-article testing is not needed. The current NTEP-certified instruments are currently present in the TSD laboratories participating in the ongoing NTEP grain moisture meter calibration program, so TSD is collecting extensive data that can be used for further assessment of UGMA-compatibility.</p>
<p>GIPSA intends to split the purchase among viable alternatives to ensure the continued availability of UGMA-compatible instruments from multiple sources. Since all NTEP/UGMA-certified instruments would be on the GIPSA Approved Equipment List the headquarters lab must, at a minimum, maintain copies of all models. The split between the competing vendors will not necessarily be 50/50.</p>
<p>Proposal Submittal</p>
<p>There are currently only two vendors who meet the prime technical requirements. As such, this is most likely a limited source procurement. The two sources are:<br />1. Dickey-john (GAC 2500b) <br />2. Perten Instruments (Aquamatic 5200)</p>
<p>Manufactures (NOT distributers) interested or capable of supplying these instruments shall contact Nathan Johnson via email (Nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov).</p>

Interested parties review the attached equipment list. The request for proposals will be set-aside 100% for small business concerns. NAICS code assigned to this requirement is 334112. The solicitation number will be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SP3300-12-R-0025 and it will close on or about June 15 2012. <br />The procurement is authorized under FAR 6.302-1 (c), only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /><br /></strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Incentive Spirometers <strong>on or about July 2012</strong>, but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br /><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSNs). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <br /><br />Examples of items being solicited could include, but are not limited to Adult Incentive Spirometers 4 Liters with 1-Way Valve, 2.5 Liters with 1-Way Valve, 5 Liters with 1-Way Valve, 1.2 Liters with 1-Way Valve. <br /><br />The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $450,014.42 annually. <br /><br />NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program, which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel, and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <strong>Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.<br /><br /></strong>Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website. <br />

Additional details can be found in the solicitation when it is posted.
The official solicitation, when posted, will be available free of charge by electronic posting only and may be found at www.fedbizopps.gov or http://ideasec.nbc.gov. PAPER COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Amendments, if/when issued, will be posted to www.fedbizopps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov for electronic downloading.

Scope of Work 
The scope of work will include:
The performance of research and writing of an administrative history of the park as an institutional entity since the time it was first proposed.  The legislative history of the park (concentrating on the period from 1962 to establishment in 1975) was published in 2004 (Voyageurs National Park: The Battle to Create Minnesota's National Park by Fred Witzig). This research project will pick up where the legislative history left off and address the period from 1975 to the present. The government will review the progress of the report development through required drafts and provide comments as necessary. It is anticipated that the final draft shall be completed, including all reviews, within 24 months of contract award.
THIS WILL NOT BE A SEALED BID OR LOW BID PROCUREMENT. A best value trade-off selection process will be conducted in accordance with FAR part 13. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, portions of FAR parts 12 and 15 may be utilized. This best value approach will use factors such as technical, price, and past performance. It is anticipated the aforementioned factors will be listed in descending order of importance and that all non-price related factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than cost/price. Failure to submit all requested information in the solicitation may result in the entire proposal being disqualified from further competition.
The Government intends to award without discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussion should it be deemed in the Government's best interest.

<DESC>1. The time and date for response is only an estimate.  

2. This notice does NOT constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid.  The intent of this notice is to identify potential offerors for a proposed construction contract action at NSA Souda Bay, Crete, Greece.

3. This project will construct two (2) independent solar water heating systems for two (2) facilities at NSA Souda Bay.  These facilities have high water resources consumption profiles; Bldg. 2 (Base Galley) and Bldg. 66 (Gym).  The systems consist of multiple solar panel arrays installed on the roofs of each facility with interconnections to existing hot water heating units within the facilities.
 Before installation, the contractor will be required to manually gauge the underground storage tanks which supply boilers with fuel oil using EPA's "Manual Tank Gauging For Small Underground Storage Tanks" method.  Tanks will be gauged monthly during the heating season.  Manual Tank Gauging Record will be maintained by the Utilities and Energy Manager.  A fuel usage baseline will be developed from this data. After installation, and for two consecutive heating seasons, the contractor will be required to measure in accordance with EPA's "Manual Tank Gauging For Small Underground Storage Tanks" method.  After installation fuel usage will be compared to before installation usage, providing actual fuel savings.

4.
 Estimated cost is between $250,000 and $500,000 US Dollars.

5. There will be a pre-proposal site visit approximately 2 weeks after the solicitation posting.

6.  This solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which requires offerors to submit a technical proposal, past performance and experience information and a price proposal for evaluation by the Government.

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management, conducted a sources sought under PR-ORD-12-01420 to determine whether small socioeconomic businesses exist to support the Office of Research and Development?s (ORD) requirement for Assessing Impacts of Nitrogen Deposition across Large Spatial Gradients
It has been determined there are not two or more small businesses capable of performing the work as outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW).  A Request for Quote (RFQ) will be issued under full and open competition and conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 ? Simplified Acquisitions approximately 15 days after the posting date of this notice.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services.  
Any firm interested in receiving an RFQ should send a request to Harold Honegger at honegger.harold@epa.gov.  A Statement of Work (SOW) for this requirement can be found below.  This is not a Request for Quote.  No solicitation is available at this time.  Questions concerning this procurement should be addressed to Harold Honegger at honegger.harold@epa.gov.   

STATEMENT OF WORK
TITLE:  Assessing Impacts of Nitrogen Deposition across Large Spatial Gradients
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Award to April 30, 2014
I. PURPOSEThe purpose of this research is to assess the environmental impacts from nitrogen deposition across large scale gradients in the United States.II. BACKGROUNDNCEA?s Global Change Research Program (GCRP) is an assessment oriented research program. The NCEA GCRP assesses the potential consequences of global change on human health, the environment, and the economy of the United States. The NCEA GCRP assists local, state, regional, and national managers and decision makers to respond to such consequences by understanding vulnerabilities and evaluating adaptation options for protecting ecosystems, resources, and human health. 
Nitrogen (N) deposition is a prominent global change factor that currently stresses ecosystems and the services people extract from them. Terrestrial plant biodiversity in particular has been identified as a sensitive ecological end point. Recent work has identified initial estimates of the ?critical loads? for N-induced species declines (Pardo et al. 2011a, Pardo et al. 2011b), which suggests that vast areas of the US may be losing or already have lost species. Whether this is actually occurring over large spatial scales has not been determined in the US, though confirmation has been found in Europe (Maskell et al. 2010, Stevens et al. 2004, Stevens et al. 2010). Work over the past year within EPA/ORD/NCEA has identified ?hot spots? where these impacts may have occurred; and, it is the intention of this SOW to assess these projections for target areas in the US. 
III. CONTRACTOR TASKSThis research covers a variety of tasks that include identification and assessment of candidate deposition gradients across the US, a literature review of available data along candidate gradients, selection of a few gradients (3 or less) for further analysis that meet agreed upon criteria, establishing monitoring sites along selected gradient(s), data collection for agreed upon environmental end points, analysis of the resulting data, and writing up of the results as a journal article (one or two).
This purchase order has two Phases: Phase 1 comprises of Tasks 1-3 and optional Phase 2 comprises of Tasks 4-5. Provided that satisfactory progress is made on Phase 1 as determined by satisfactory completion of the deliverables for Tasks 1-3, and resources are available, optional Phase 2 will be exercised.
In order to successfully complete the work under this statement of work, the Contractor must have the following expertise: academic training in ecology at the PhD level, with an emphasis on terrestrial plant ecology, biogeochemistry, and statistics; experience with geospatial analyses and understanding of the critical loads approach (e.g. Pardo et al 2011); and, recognition as an expert on the impacts of nitrogen deposition.PHASE 1
Task 1:	Establish regular communication.The Contractor shall schedule an initial conference call with the EPA Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR) to ensure clear understanding regarding the Statement of Work (SOW). The Contractor shall convene this call within one week of receipt of the approved simplified acquisition purchase order for this SOW from the Contracting Officer (CO). Thereafter, the Contractor shall arrange for regular (every 1-4 weeks as agreed to by the COTR) conference calls with the COTR to provide updates on progress and address concerns as they arise. These calls should not exceed one hour. On these calls and in writing (email is acceptable), the Contractor shall inform the COTR of any developments that affect the conduct or schedule of the deliverables under this SOW. Copies of all deliverables should be sent concurrently to the COR and the COTR. Copies of all correspondence pertaining to the performance of this purchase order sha ll be sent to the COTR and copied to the COR and CO.
Deliverable 1a:	Initial conference call with the COTR.Deliverable 1b:	Schedule regular conference calls with the COTR.
Task 2:	Identify and assess candidate deposition gradients for analysis.The Contractor shall identify and assess candidate deposition gradients for analysis. N deposition maps and associated data provided by the COTR (possibly augmented by the Contractor) will provide the initial template for identification and assessment. Geospatial analyses of the N deposition maps will identify candidate gradients. Criteria for selection of candidate gradients will be developed, and should consider the magnitude of the N deposition gradient, type of N deposition along the gradient (e.g. wet vs. dry, oxidized vs. reduced), length of the gradient (e.g. km), presence of natural/seminatural sites along the gradient, and heterogeneity along the gradient (e.g. of soil types, vegetation, local land use, etc.). An assessment (literature analysis) of available data and available sampling sites along candidate gradients will also be major components of the selection criteria. Following discussions with the COTR on the results of the identification and assessment, a reco mmendation for gradient(s) to be selected for further analysis will be made.
Deliverable 2a: 	Initial memo describing the identification and assessment process, including criteria for selection. Due one week after Deliverable 1a.Deliverable 2b: Final memo describing the identification and assessment process, including criteria for selection. Due one week after Deliverable 2a.Deliverable 2c: Draft technical report identifying and assessing candidate deposition gradients, including tables of candidate gradient properties. Due six months after Deliverable 2b.Deliverable 2d: Final technical report identifying and assessing candidate deposition gradients, including tables of candidate gradient properties. Due one month after Deliverable 2c.Deliverable 2e: Memo recommending deposition gradient(s) for further analysis. Due one week after Deliverable 2d.
Task 3: 	Set up monitoring sites along selected deposition gradient(s).Following selection of gradients by the COTR using recommendations from the Contractor, the Contractor will then develop and implement a plan for monitoring the impacts of N deposition along the gradient(s). A draft plan will be generated that includes the number of sites, their size, locations along the gradient, and the ecological responses to be sampled. Several responses should be considered, including N deposition, plant community structure, leaf N content, soil pH, soil CEC, root:shoot, microbial community structure and/or function, and light penetration to the soil surface. Following exchange with the COTR, a final plan and implementation schedule will be generated.
Deliverable 3a: A draft plan for monitoring and analysis along selected gradients. Due one month after Deliverable 2e.Deliverable 3b: A final plan for monitoring and analysis along selected gradients. Due two weeks after Deliverable 3a.
PHASE II (OPTIONAL)

The SMS is a motion table for payloads up to 24,000 lbs, located at the NRL facility in Chesapeake, MD. The SMS was originally built by Westinghouse in 1943 as a gun platform requiring only primitive motion in roll, pitch and yaw. NRL plans to use the upgraded system for operational testing in an environment simulating operations at sea.<span>&nbsp; </span>To use the SMS dynamically with today&rsquo;s high precision systems NRL requires upgrade to its control and monitoring systems with state of the art equipment. The scope of the effort is a refurbishment and upgrade of the SMS, not a replacement effort. The foundation and two main decks will be re-utilized. All drive hardware will be replaced with state of the art equipment including motion control and monitoring. The effort includes: Design of the Drive System, Platform (two configurations) and the Control System, Disassembly of the current SMS and disposal of non reutilized parts, equipment and components, Manufacture and assembly of the replacement components and on-site test/demonstration of the refurbished system. It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract will result from the solicitation. The anticipated period of performance from SMS disassembly, reconstitution, installation and test/demonstration is anticipated to be nine (9) months from date of award. A detailed solicitation including a Statement of Work and requirements documentation will be available and posted approximately 15 days from the posting of this notice. NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs.&nbsp;Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided.&nbsp; The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued.&nbsp; All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.&nbsp; Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.&nbsp;The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</span></p>

See 'Obtaining Solicitation Documents' below.<br>_______________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Project Description:  (Approx. quantities)<br><br>Omaha District will issue a construction contract for the purpose of completing four work efforts. One of the four work efforts consist of replacing (8) intake push button gate hoist controllers with (4) Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC's) for (8) gates within the (4) flood control towers.  <br> <br>The first work effort consists of replacing eight (8) existing flood tunnel intake gate hoist controllers with programmable logic controller (PLC) based controllers that are designed to be controlled locally at HMI (human-machine interface) touch panels and integrated with the local power plant control system (PPCS) for remote operation. There are four flood tunnels with two gates and gate hoists per tunnel. Each of eight hoist controllers shall be replaced. One PLC shall be installed in each of the four towers, and each PLC shall interact with both hoist controllers in its respective tower. Each hoist control cabinet shall have an HMI touch panel on the front of its cabinet; the HMI touch panel will allow for control of only the hoist controller to which it is attached. Each PLC shall have surge suppression, power conditioning (PCU), and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) battery backup, which shall also supply power to the HMI touch panels and absolute encoder modules (two per PLC, one per hoist).<br><br>A second work effort is replacing (8) manually operated dampers with (8) new motorized dampers in the (4) flood control tower shaft ventilation system louvers.  New controls for louver actuators shall also be provided and integrated with the respective PLCs. Contractor shall ensure the encoder that is mounted on hoist shaft shall have a minimum accuracy of 1/8". The shaft makes 3 revolutions for every foot of gate travel. Total gate travel is 128 feet.  Existing limit switches to remain property of the government and are not to be removed after disconnecting relays from existing control cabinet.  Existing control cabinets are to be removed.<br><br>The third work effort consists of repairing concrete cracking and spalling at (18) intake structure curtain wall bearing support locations along with (1) similar walkway repair. The intake structure is equipped with "connecting beams" and "curtain walls" between towers. The connecting beams are structural elements that rigidly connect the tops of the towers, and curtain walls are architectural elements that give a uniform appearance to the structure where connecting beams are not included. There are a total of 10 curtain walls, with 5 on the upstream side of the intake structure and 5 on the downstream side.  The curtain walls are cracking and spalling at their bearings, and all twenty bearings will be repaired under this contract. Repairs consist of removing unsound concrete, applying mortar to return the walls to as-built dimensions, and sealing cracks by injecting epoxy. There is also one walkway connected to a curtain wall that is spalling at one end and will require repair by removing unsound concrete and applying mortar to return it to as-built dimensions.<br><br>The fourth work effort consists of placing upstream and downstream drain pipe extensions on (10) of the (12) intake structure towers.  Drainage from pipes above the curtain walls is contributing to the concrete deterioration. To keep water away from the curtain wall bearings, outfalls of twenty drain pipes will be extended under this contract.<br><br>The estimated construction cost of this project is between	$1,000,000 and $2,500,000.    	       <br>_______________________________________________________________________________<br><br>The Contractor will be required to commence work within 10 days after notice to proceed and complete the work 180 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I. Sources Sought Synopsis: <br /></span><br />This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted.<br /><br />a) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide training services for F-16 Mission Training Centers (MTC) following the end of the existing MTC services contract in April 2012. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award. <br /><br />b) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS.<br /><br />c) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Sources Sought Synopsis, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. <br /><br />d) Background: The F-16 MTCs are currently operating at the following Air Force Bases: Shaw, Misawa, and Spangdahlem. The F-16 MTCs are part of the Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) Program. DMO is an operational readiness initiative that networks geographically separated training devices in a real-time synthetic battlefield. It is scalable to provide individual, team, and team-of-teams combat training and mission rehearsal. It is the backbone for the Virtual Flag exercise used for AEF spin-up and the cornerstone of the AF training transformation. The F-16 MTC Integrated Product Team at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is responsible for fielding aircrew training device capability that ensures the trainers maintain concurrency with the aircraft co-located at each base. Currently this capability is provided through a training simulation services contract that meets the Air Force requirements. This contract is programmed to end in April 2012.<br /><br />e) The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15, services contract with an extension of the current contract for six-months from 01 May 2012-31 October 2012. <br /><br />f) All current MTC equipment is contractor owned, in the required aircraft platform configuration and DMO standards, therefore no equipment will be provided by the Government. Any potential offeror must be able to provide fully operational F-16 units to the Air Force. All services will be housed in Government facilities and utilized by personnel designated by the government. Government-contracted instructors, separate from this acquisition, will use all aspects of the services in preparation for and conduct of lessons.<br /><br />g) Payment for training services under this contract will commence with start of service at each site.<br /><br />h) The purpose of this SSS is to determine offeror interest in providing training service support on contractor-owned fully operational F-16 MTC units to the Air Force. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">II. Program Requirements:<br /></span><br />a) This document specifies the performance requirements for the United States Air Force (USAF) F-16 Block 50 Mission Training Center (MTC) System Services that provide interim training services between the current contract, FA8621-07-D-6272, and the Full-Up F-16 Block 40/42/50/52 System Procurement contract. In this document the term Block 50 refers to F-16 Block 50/52. System Services refers to the total services provided under this contract, to include, but not limited to F-16 MTC simulation, security, mission control, and support capabilities. An F-16 Mission Training Center (MTC) shall consist of a four-ship F-16 system simulation along with scenario generation capability and two briefing/debriefing stations. Each System Simulation will consist of a representation of the appropriate F-16 aircraft model, both cockpit and software simulation, Instructor Operator Station (IOS), and a synthetic environment. Each F-16 MTC shall support basic and advanced mission training, tactics validation, operational test and evaluation, exercise support, and mission rehearsal, to include but not limited to, all weapons, internal and/or external sensors, communication systems, avionics systems associated with the F-16 Block 50, and operation in both local and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) environments. Each F-16 MTC constitutes a DMO Federate System that can interoperate with other geographically distributed DMO Federate Systems, as part of a larger DMO Federation linked by the DMO Network (DMON), to provide real-time combat team training during scheduled DMO Events. The F-16 MTC shall provide a four ship system simulation that is capable of single-ship, local multi-ship, and long-haul multi-ship (DMO) training and mission operations at each operating location. The system simulation shall provide an ownship simulation; a realistic, high-fidelity synthetic environment with synthetic forces; all avionics and weapons; an IOS to control each cockpit; and a visual system with the full field-of-view (FOV) experienced by the pilot in the aircraft.

Visual cues presented to the pilot shall simulate those in the F-16 aircraft and shall not present false, erroneous, or inappropriate perceptions that would adversely impact aircrew training. The visual simulation shall support realistic Detection, Orientation, Recognition, Identification (DORI), target range, aspect angle, and closure rate determination by crew members for all targets and threats. The visual simulation shall support mission report functions such as visual Line-of-Sight (LOS) ranging, LOS material property, LOS entity ID, height of terrain, weapons impact detection, collisions detection, and intervisibility testing. Terrain and other solid objects shall appropriately limit physical flyout of weapons. The visual simulation shall display realistic representations of hostile and friendly weapons effects (e.g., missiles in flight, AAA, bomb detonations, cluster bomb detonations, smoke columns, multi-state damaged models, countermeasures, SAM launch blast, SAM trajectory, and gun tracer trajectory).<br /><br />5) Networking. The F-16 MTC shall be capable of providing distributed exercise and regular recurring DMO participation. The system shall interoperate with other existing and planned DMO Systems and shall comply with the adopted DMO System Standards. The F-16 MTC shall operate as a participating DMO Federate System in the DMO System for distributed network training. The F-16 MTC shall support the simultaneous conduct of any combination of local single-ship and networked missions, and DMO Events. The DMON will be interconnected with other Department of Defense (DoD) military services' training systems in the future to accommodate Joint Task Force (JTF) training. The F-16 MTC shall not develop any unique architecture or non-standards-compliant interfaces that would preclude or otherwise limit DMO connectivity and interoperability. No degradation in operating performance shall be noticed in the F-16C MTC when operating in the DMO environment except as limited by fidelity or interoperability of external entities not under the control of the F-16 MTC. All missions and operations supported in the local training modes shall be supported in the DMO environment. This includes training with external constructive, virtual, or live entities.<br /><br />6) Briefing/Debriefing (B/DB) Capability. The F-16 MTC shall include two B/DB capable rooms. The B/DB rooms shall have a minimum occupancy of 8 people per room. The B/DB rooms shall be interchangeable and B/DB shall be able to operate simultaneously at multiple levels of security. The B/DB shall support mission generation/modification capabilities. The B/DB shall provide simultaneous video teleconferencing to support briefing and debriefing without degrading any local mission or DMO Event in progress. The B/DB capability shall operate at the same network security level as the mission being supported. The briefing capability shall support commercial briefing presentation formats commonly used by F-16 instructors and flight leads for accessing and presenting squadron briefings. The briefing capability shall support pre-mission planning and briefing to prepare F-16 pilots for any existing mission scenario, and shall be interoperable with Air Force mission planning systems. For DMO Events, the briefing capability shall support simultaneous viewing of presentation data with secure distributed participant teleconference video and audio. The debriefing capability shall support debriefing of the F-16 pilots for any recorded mission scenario. The debriefing capability shall permit the playback of recorded segments of a mission scenario from each local cockpit's perspective and a God's eye view at normal and accelerated speeds. The debriefing capability shall display a summary on the effectiveness of maneuvers, countermeasures, weapons delivery, and the percentage of damage incurred on a target for battle damage assessment. B/DB shall include a large display three-dimensional or God's eye view (vertical, horizontal, or from any point in space) of the scenario with a zoom capability to observe selected views of the engagement. Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) performance may be used as a guide.

<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of market research being conducted by the Air Force to identify capable potential sources.</p>
<p>The United States Air Force, through the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) is conducting market research to identify potential business sources interested in providing E-4B NAOC Supply Chain Management services. The E-4B is a fleet of 4 highly modified Boeing 747-200s. Due to the small fleet size, aircraft availability is of primary importance to the E-4B community and should be thoroughly considered by prospective offerors.</p>
<p>The E-4B serves as the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) for the National Command Authorities (NCA) and provides a worldwide-deployable, enduring node of the National Military Command System (NMCS) to fulfill national security requirements throughout the full spectrum of conflict. It is a modern, highly survivable, command, control and communications center to direct U.S. forces, execute emergency war orders and coordinate civil authorities' activities, including national contingency plans. <br />The E-4B sustainment program will involve logistical support and sustainment of aircraft, engines, avionics, and mission systems; with the potential for modifications including structural and avionics (racks, equipment and wiring); and both recurring and non-recurring engineering services. Contractual requirements will include (but are not limited to): program management; Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) agreements for airframe, avionics, engines, and communication systems currently on the aircraft; strategic planning, risk management and mitigation, budgeting and execution of government approved plans and programs.</p>
<p>Sustainment requirements for supply management including Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS), Obsolescence Management, Operational Support, Depot Maintenance Support, Government Supported Items Support, Electronic Repair Facility and Quality Assurance.</p>
<p>Qualified contractors and/or subcontractors should have knowledge of Boeing 747-200 along with access to E-4B specific engineering and Master Data List (MDL). The contractor should also have knowledge of and ability to repair electronics, hardware, software, support equipment, and communication systems. Contractors must have access to suitable facilities, tools, equipment, and personnel to provide all E-4B services and have the ability to certify or get certification to Military, commercial, or FAA airworthiness standards as required.</p>
<p>For purposes of market research, the Government is seeking to understand the capability and capacity of all interested firms. The following questions apply to an acquisition strategy in which a partial set-aside could potentially be awarded to a small business for a portion of the requirement described above.</p>
<p>1. As a small or large business, do you believe conditions exist for a set-aside in accordance with FAR 19.502-3(a) for the requirement described above and in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS)? If yes, please indicate what you believe to be the most appropriate NAICS code for the requirement.</p>
<p>2. Are you most interested in performing as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the requirement described above and in the attached PWS, and indicate whether you would qualify as a small or large business under the NAICS code you believe is most appropriate?</p>
<p>3. If you are a small business, are you capable of performing at least 50% of the work, in order to comply with FAR Clause 52.219-14, specifically 52.219-14(c)(1), "At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."</p>
<p>4. If you are a small business interested in performing the requirement as a set- aside, provide a brief summary of your company's experience and past performance within the past three years as a prime contractor as it relates to the magnitude of this anticipated requirement.</p>
<p>5. Do you anticipate needing contract financing? If yes, please explain.</p>
<p>6. Do you have any other thoughts or suggestions on ways to increase small business <br />participation in this requirement?</p>
<p>Responses must include the following: name and address of firm, capabilities related to the task areas above, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners; intent to participate in the upcoming acquisition as a prime offeror; list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number). The page limitation for this submission is ten (10) pages.</p>
<p><br />Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not reimburse the respondents for any costs associated with their responses. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.

The Government reserves the right to contact the submitting parties, on an as required basis, for further clarification on material provided. The Government will evaluate the information provided, use it to document our market research and develop the RFP. In addition, the Government will use its evaluation of the information and other research to determine the sources that appear qualified to perform the work required by the Government. The Government intends to release the RFP only to those respondents who are deemed qualified for this requirement based on their initial response. <br />Point of Contact <br />Contractors responding to this Sources Sought Synopsis shall submit the above information electronically no later than 31 May 2012, 4:30 PM EST to M.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Belvoir Division is seeking sources on behalf of the RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) for state-of-the-art III-V high-operating temperature (HOT) (>150K) focal plane arrays (FPAs) for wide-area (5 km x 5 km) persistent surveillance (1-5 Hz update rate).  The intent of this market research is to identify potential capabilities and approaches for research and development through the assessment of FPA parameters including format, pixel pitch, cooling requirements, and cost detailed below.<br><br>The Government seeks information about capabilities for the development of full-size, small (5-8 um) pitch, large (4K x 4K) sub-array FPAs that could be ready for demonstration in Fiscal Year 2015.  This RFI solicits only information on new III-V epi layered infrared materials for HOT Mid-Wave (MW) FPAs. <br><br>Sources possessing the above capabilities that satisfy the pixel pitch, format, cooling, and low-cost requirements are invited to submit a White Paper not to exceed 20 pages in length describing their capabilities.  The White Paper must include, at a minimum, comprehensive answers supported by facts and rigorous scientific reasoning, to the following four sets of questions:<br>1. What is the minimum pixel pitch that can be successfully demonstrated in the next few years? <br>a) Please provide a list of critical enabling technologies that have to be developed before or in parallel with small-pitch FPA development and demonstration. Facts in funding history and actual performance parameters, together with the anticipated progress time line, will help NVESD to make realistic assessment of future funding requirement and to set performance expectations.<br>b) If a traditional hybridization scheme is required to connect the detector array and readout integrated circuit (ROIC) during the FPA fabrication, what is the expected operability in electrical interconnect, and what is the operability definition used in deriving the number? Based on performance data of existing FPAs, what is the operability as a function of pixel pitch?  What are the materials and mechanisms deployed for hybridization? If your company is already developing small-pitch FPAs, what are the issues already encountered and what solutions have been used for mitigation? What are the issues anticipated and what could be the solutions? The same set of questions applies if alternative hybridization or connection schemes are to be used.<br>c) What ROIC technology is suitable for the small-pixel-pitch FPAs? What is the well capacity that can be achieved? Are there ways to mitigate multiple row or column outages? If the answer is yes, what is the estimated development cost if a successful ROIC demonstration has to be completed? What is the estimated ROIC yield and cost? <br>d) Please provide information on FPA processing of small pitch and discuss any issues related to detector pixel sidewall leakage current and passivation approaches associated with your most promising designs. <br>e) Measured or modeled results on FPA modulation transfer function, spatial cross talk, detector quantum efficiency and fill factor as a function of FPA pitch, or at the pitch size that you consider most promising. <br><br>2. What is the optimum format of stand-alone and butted FPAs, given the pixel pitch discussed above and the application described in the Background section? <br>a) What should be the largest format of a single-chip FPA? <br>b) What should be the optimum subarray format of a large butted FPA? <br>c) What technologies can be used for butting, and what is the seam loss at each interface? <br>d) Are there ways to mitigate the seam loss either at the FPA level or at the sensor system level? If the answer is yes, please explain how and discuss estimated time frame and development cost. <br>e) Given your answers to all questions above, what is the estimated cost of the large format butted FPA once it's in production? Please show how you derived the number. <br><br>3. (Optional) If possible, please discuss any special requirement on the FPA pitch that you have discovered in preparing attractive designs for persistent surveillance systems. <br><br>4. (Optional) If possible, please provide the cost per ground pixel at 1-5 Hz for the purpose of comparing the cost at the system level. Please show the detailed derivation and all assumptions made. If you believe that a better optimization parameter for the cost should be used, please specify it and explain your reasoning.<br><br>White papers must cover one of the following question combinations:<br><br>	a. 1 and 2<br>	b. 1, 2 and 3<br>	c. 1, 2, and 4<br>	d. 1, 2, 3 and 4<br><br>Technical POC:<br>Dr. Meimei Tidrow<br>US Army CERDEC NVESD <br>RDER-NVD<br>10221 Burbeck Road<br>Fort Belvoir, VA 22060<br>703-704-2793<br><br>Papers shall also include:<br>1.

<DESC>This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses (see FAR Part 19.5).  The small business size standard for this acquisition is $14 million in gross annual receipts averaged over the previous three 1-year accounting periods. The applicable NAICS code is 541370 and the SIC code is 8713.
To be eligible for contract award, a firm shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database located at http://www.ccr.gov, and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database located at https://orca.bpn.gov/, and the registrations shall be current.
This acquisition is for architect-engineer (A-E) services, and is procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in Subpart 36.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit: (1) a Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, Parts I and II, and (2) any requested supplemental data to the procurement office shown. Firms responding to this announcement before the closing date will be considered for selection, subject to any limitations indicated with respect to size and geographic location of firm, specialized technical expertise or other requirements listed. Please note: this is not a request for proposal and there is no solicitation to download. However, a copy of the Statement of Work for the ID/IQ contracts will be made available for download at http://www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts/index.html the same week as this announcement.
The information required to submit an offer is listed below. Questions pertaining to this announcement should be address to the Contracting Officer listed in the announcement via e-mail. Questions will be accepted up to 3 business days prior to the closing date listed in the announcement.  
The Pacific Northwest Regional Office of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation intends to award up to three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for professional surveying services for surveying in the states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington (up to one for each state).  The contract for Idaho potentially includes small portions of western Montana & Wyoming (see http://www.usbr.gov/pn/). The contracts will be single-award ID/IQs for each state, not multiple-award ID/IQs, and Task Orders will not be competed. Task Orders placed under the contracts will be fixed-price. The guaranteed minimum order under each contract will be $25,000 and the maximum contract value will be set at $2 million per contract. We currently have six ID/IQ contracts in place: two each for Oregon, Washington, and Idaho and placed approximately $1.5 million in orders against those contracts with orders ranging from approximately $2,000 to $350,000 each. The maximum value of $2 million per contract is being set in the event that Reclamation requires more surveying services in future years than in the previous 5 years.  
Only firms with Registered Professional Surveyors licensed in the states of interest where work will be conducted will be considered.  The work will mainly involve surveying assistance on an intermittent, as-needed basis in support of Reclamation efforts to improve salmon/steelhead habitat as well as in support of other Reclamation activities including operation and maintenance of our dams, power plants and other facilities.  Services may be sought on a short turnaround basis (e.g., response within a week or two of a Task Order placed under the contract) and will typically be required at river/stream diversion structures and related facilities such as dams, weirs, canals, and fish screens.  
Required services may include: assessing site topography (topographic information on and around barriers, abutments, etc.); preparing sections (on/upstream/downstream of barriers with notes on water elevations, substrate type, etc.); providing structure details (elevations and dimensions on and around barriers, headworks, culverts, etc.); collecting information on miscellaneous features (ground surface topography, trees, fence lines, power and other utilities, bridges, access conditions, etc.); as well as recorded legal boundary surveys and production of surveys, maps and drawings showing true elevations and survey control. Other potential services may involve aerial surveys and photogrammetry; bathymetry; or 3D laser scanning. 
The Contractor(s) shall produce Field Book Data Files and Digital Terrain Models representing true elevations and survey control in Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D 2012, configured with the Pacific Northwest Region's (PN) standards and using PN's standard operating procedures as provided by the Contracting Officer.  
Currently identified geographic areas in which surveying is needed include West Central Idaho and South Central Idaho, various river basins and subbasins in both Oregon and Washington, and at existing Reclamation dams, power plants, and facilities in all three states. The quantity and timing of survey work may be adjusted by the Government based on changes in priority workload and funding availability. TOs for surveys are not limited to the areas listed. 
It is Reclamation's intent to award up to three ID/IQ contracts for surveys, potentially one for each of the three States.  Offerors may propose on a single State or more than one State. Each contract may be issued as a 1 year contract with four 1 year Option periods (potential contract durations of 5 years). General land-based surveying services will be required in all states and 3D laser scanning services or aerial surveying services may also be required. Estimated performance time will vary with each individual task order.  The Government currently estimates that we will require 1 to 10 surveys per State per year.  
Firms qualified and interested in providing professional surveying services of the types listed above are hereby invited to submit: Standard Form 330 (SF 330), "Architect-Engineer Qualifications," Part I and SF 330 Part II. An Adobe Acrobat version of the SF 330 form is available at www.gsa.gov.  Please enter the State(s) for which you wish to provide surveying services in Block #1 of the SF 330.  
In evaluating responses, the following evaluation criteria will be applied, with all evaluation criteria being equivalent:
(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services. Include your firm's Registered Professional Surveyors' experience in similar surveys for the state your firm proposes to perform surveys in.  In your SF-330, state the amount of time, expressed as a percent, that the responsible (licensed) land surveyor will work on survey projects. 
(2) Specialized experience, expertise, and technical competence in the type of work required for the specific geographic areas your firm is proposing to perform services in.  List years of experience in similar surveys for the key personnel that will be assigned to the projects.  Indicate your firm's knowledge of local survey practices for the localities you propose to perform surveys in.  Include an outline of field and office procedures, including a self-inspection or QA/QC plan.  
(3) Capacity of the firm to provide the required services in the required time. List your firm's equipment, personnel availability, and management and quality control procedures used to ensure reasonable deadlines are met and quality deliverables are produced.  Include any proposed subcontractor(s) (including applicable portions of their SF330s) and specify what duties they would perform (for example, specialties like aerial surveys, LiDAR, photogrammetry, bathymetry, or laser scanning).  
(4) Recent, relevant, successful past performance on similar A-E surveying contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  Please provide only references for projects that are similar in scope and magnitude to the required services.  Submit a sample map and drawing showing topographic survey data and sections and plan and profile views for river/stream environments.
(5) Location of the firm in the general geographical area of the areas for which they wish to be considered and demonstrated knowledge and expertise in performing surveys in those localities (Washington, Oregon, or Idaho). Indicate how you plan to provide service in a cost effective manner.  
When preparing your submission (SF 330 package), be sure to consider all five evaluation criteria. Additional sheets may be used to address all evaluation criteria relative to the required services.  
Following the initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, discussions will occur with the one firm per state considered to be the most highly-qualified to provide the services for that state.  Negotiations will occur beginning with the most preferred firm(s) in the final selection and only firms selected for negotiation will receive a solicitation (Request for Proposals).  If a mutually agreeable contract can be reached, then award will be made.  If not, then negotiations with that firm will be terminated and the next most preferred firm for that particular state would be contacted for negotiation.  
Please submit three copies of the above information (SF330 package) to: U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, 1150 N. Curtis Road, Boise ID 83706-1234, ATTN: PN-3715, Contracting Officer; include Solicitation No. R12PS10030 on the outside of the package.  
To be considered, all material must be received by 2 PM local time in Boise ID on June 12, 2012.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Installation Description:</strong></span></p>
<p>Gillem Enclave is an approximately 237-acre site located in Forest Park, 10 miles southeast of Atlanta, Georgia. It is home to the 1st U.S. Army, the Army &amp; Air Force Exchange Service (Atlanta Distribution Center), 3D Military Police Group (CID) United States Army Criminal Investigation Command, 2nd Recruiting Brigade, 52nd Ordnance Group and the Equipment Concentration Site for the 81st Regional Support Command, and many other Army, Department of Defense and Government organizations. <br /><br />Named in honor of Lieutenant General Alvan Cullom Gillem, Jr., the Installation was established in 1941 with the relocation of the Candler Warehouse from the Atlanta General Depot to what is now Fort Gillem. The depot saw many name changes as it served as trainer and supplier throughout World War II, the Korean Conflict, the Berlin Airlift, the Cuban Crisis and the Vietnam War. Thousands of soldiers trained at the Installation and tons of equipment destined for war zones processed through the warehouse system. In 1973, the responsibility for the Installation was transferred from the Army Materiel Command to U.S. Army Forces Command and the Installation was renamed Fort Gillem and made a satellite installation of Fort McPherson. In 2005, the Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) recommended the closure of Fort Gillem. Under this action, the Army disposed of roughly 1,189 acres of surplus property on 15 September 2011 and will retain and maintain an enclave of roughly 237 acres for continued military use of the existing site.</p>

<DESC>The Enterprise Configuration Management and Operational Services Team at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires engineering services and software solution support to include custom development, implementation planning, training, requirements analysis and information technology communications support for the FAA's Web Configuration Management System (WebCM).
WebCM is a custom FAA system that runs on Eden Application Development and Deployment Framework software and provides help desk and maintenance support to over 3,500 users across the FAA network.  WebCM also provides origination, management, and monitoring of National Airspace Change Proposals (NCP) from case file initiation to a final Configuration Control Decision (CCDs) in support of the National Airspace (NAS) Configuration Management infrastructure.Therefore, the FAA is conducting this market survey to seek potential sources capable of meeting the following technical and delivery requirements:  1)	The FAA is requesting capabilities statements from vendors that possess Eden Architecture enterprise licenses that can support the WebCM platform; 2)	The Contractor must provide Eden Architecture software and be an authorized enterprise license provider.  Substitutions will not be accepted;3)	Experience providing engineering services and software solution support to include custom development, implementation planning, training, requirements analysis and information technology communications support for the FAA's Web Configuration Management System (WebCM).Any vendor that believes it can provide these services is invited to submit a Capability Statement (in contractor format) addressing its abilities to meet all of the requirements identified above.  
This is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price Contract with a period of performance of one base year and four one year option periods.All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 5 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 11 point may be used.  
PURPOSE:This market survey is designed to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  At this time the nature of the final competition has not been determined.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under a full and open competition.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services with a size standard of $25 million. 
The FAA requires proof of documentation from interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and from eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Program.  
In order to make this determination and to be considered responsive, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
a.        Capability Statement (addressing the ability to meet all the requirements identified above);b.        Completed Business Declaration Form (attached);c.        Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form or proof of documentation from service-disabled veteran-owned small business (if applicable).

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)Introduction:This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment,implied or otherwise, that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) willtake any procurement action in this matter. Further, neither NASA nor the Governmentgenerally will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. TheNASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is currently seeking potential vendors capable ofdelivering a qualified optical encoder and additional copies for the Joint PolarSatellite System (JPSS) and future NASA Goddard projects. JPSS is a joint NASA andNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) program that provides data forclimate and weather forecasting. This RFI is to solicit specific capability information from industry for this criticaltechnology.  This RFI is being used to gather market research for NASA to make decisionsregarding procurement strategies for the development of space-qualified optical encoders.Background:NASA anticipates several future JPSS missions which will require instruments similar tothose presently under development for the JPSS-1 mission.  Several of those instruments,and many other NASA missions, utilize optical encoders.  Over the past decade, theprocurement of these encoders has resulted in numerous schedule delays, cost overruns andthe acceptance of flight risks as a result of inadequate design implementation,electronic parts obsolescence and workmanship issues in the delivered products. Thedevelopment of a reliable, cost-effective optical encoder built to the demanding missionassurance standards required to ensure the safety of NASA missions is essential to thesuccess of JPSS and future NASA missions.  An investment in this technology is beingconsidered as risk mitigation for JPSS.  There exist several optical encoder vendors, butvery few offer a qualified design acceptable for space flight.	This RFI is intended tohelp NASA understand the challenges and opportunities associated with the development ofa suitable optical encoder.  Development of this qualified encoder would be done under aNASA contract; however, it is highly likely that, as part of this contract performance,the encoder vendor would need to engage in technical discussions with various JPSSinstrument suppliers such as Exelis, Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems (RSAS), and BallAerospace Technology Corporation (BATC).Potential suppliers of this technology should further understand that NASA may ultimatelyrequire more than just the delivery of an encoder or multiple unit copies.  NASA wouldprefer a vendor capable of installing and aligning the encoder to a motor/bearingassembly that would be provided by an Instrument Supplier.  Therefore, NASA is seeking asupplier that can both deliver qualified optical encoders and can be entrusted with NASAflight pedigree motor and bearing hardware (and associated design information) to design,install, and align the encoder.  For JPSS, the encoder vendor may be required to installthe slip ring assembly within their encoder housing.  Technology Description:The following is a general system description of an encoder relevant to our application. A space qualified cross-track optical encoder would likely consist of a glass code diskand hub assembly; a read station assembly comprised of light sources, photocells, circuitcard assembly (CCA) and dust cover; and a remote CCA containing the interpolationelectronics.  Alternative design concepts are welcomed.  The encoder would provide themounting and electrical interfaces for a Government supplied slip ring assembly.  It isimperative that the encoder operate within specification over the full 360 degreerotation in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.  Respondents should assumethere will be stringent pointing requirements which will require the encoder to supply 17bits (48 microradians) during operation at high speeds which for the purposes of this RFIcan be assumed are 600 deg/sec and accelerations up to 50,000 deg/sec^2; and 21 bits (3microradians) at an assumed reduced operating speed of &#8804; 45 deg/sec. The resolutionspecifications should allow the position for any resolved shaft angle to be within  100&#956;radians of the true shaft angle relative to the Index position.  The ability toinitially locate the index position of the shaft (zero position) must be accomplishedupon motor startup by limiting bidirectional shaft angular velocities from zero to&#960;/8 radian per second (22.5 degree/sec).The total mass of the encoder assembly including a remote CCA (and redundancy) should beless than 4 lbs. The total mass of the optical unit portion of the encoder should beminimized.  The total steady-state power consumed by the encoder should be less than 5Watts at end of life (EOL).  It will need to have redundant electronics with temperaturesensors and a Built-In-Test capability looking for erroneous position reporting that isimplemented per revolution of operation.  Additional electrical interface, thermaldissipation, mechanical and vibrational testing performance requirements as well asmaterials and parts, workmanship, and EMI/EMC and radiation requirements will bespecified at a later date either by the instrument vendor or the government; however, thetest program will be based on GSFC-STD-7000 and the Mission Assurance requirements willbe based on the Instrument Mission Assurance Requirements (JPSS Document 472-00026). Both should be reviewed and considered in your responses.Conceptual Schedule:ATP-Oct 2012, SRR-Jan 2013, PDR-Apr 2013, CDR-Sep 2013, PER-Mar 2014, and PSR-Jul 2014Schedule Figure Acronyms:ATP, authorization to proceedCDR, critical design reviewSRR, system requirement reviewPER, pre-environmental test reviewPDR, preliminary design reviewPSR, pre-shipment reviewRFI Instructions:NASA does not require the submission of proprietary data, and in fact prefers thatresponses not include such data if not deemed necessary by the respondent. Anyproprietary information that is provided must be appropriately marked where applicable.This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and it is not to be construed as acommitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submittedin response. It is anticipated that NASA/GSFC will proceed with a future procurement andis seeking capabilities from all potential sources. However, this RFI does not commit theGovernment to future funding opportunities from NASA nor is it to be construed as acommitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement. Respondents will notbe notified of the results. As part of its assessment of industry capabilities, theNASA/GSFC may contact respondents to this RFI if clarifications or further informationare needed. Capability statements shall be submitted to the points of contact listed below and mustbe received by 1 July 2012, no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>Background: <br />The National Institutes of Health Center for Regenerative Medicine (NIH-CRM) is a resource for the National Institutes of Health Intramural Research Program (NIH IRP) in the area of stem cell technology. One main goal of the NIH-CRM is to provide the NIH IRP with support in order to move research in the area of stem cell technology forward. To better support the NIH IRP, the NIH-CRM plans to establish a bank of cell lines to be shared and used by the greater NIH community.</p>
<p><br />Objective:<br />The objective of this contract is to generate iPSC lines that can be utilized by the greater NIH-IRP community. It is proposed that the NIH will distribute the cells obtained under this contract through a repository (for profit or non profit) to both academic and non-academic users. It is expected that these users will utilize these cells for developing tools for translational work including screening of molecular libraries.</p>
<p>*Note: The cells will be distributed under a standard Material Trade Agreement (MTA) between the Contractor and NIH. Use of proprietary technology, processes, or restrictions that prevent NIH from use of the iPSC lines will not be contracted with.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>The contractor shall generate 10 iPSC lines using the Sendai virus technology, and feeder free conditions, in a high thru-put manner utilizing Nanostring technology.</p>
<p>The tasks will require obtaining tissue samples from normal or specified patient populations (these tissue samples may be provided by the contractor or my NIH-CRM) expanding the tissue to an appropriate number of cells, inserting pluripotency inducing molecules into the cells, identifying clones that fulfill the criteria of pluripotency, and providing a minimum of two sets of clones; that are karyotypically normal and pluripotent.</p>
<p>Deliverables:<br />The contractor shall provide two vials per line, at 1-2 million cells per vial. Custom Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines shall be generated using the zero footprint technology of the Sendai virus, using feeder free conditions in serum free media. The contractor shall generate the lines using high thru-put automation technology and quality control potency testing using Nanostring technology.</p>

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command, Installation Contracting Office, Fort Leonard Wood, MO (MICC-ICO-FW) is requesting information from sanitary refuse industry professionals; NAICS 562991 - Septic Tank and Related Services. MICC-ICO-FW has a requirement for the collection and disposal of sanitary refuse from both portable and permanent latrines on the installation, as well as at Lake of the Ozarks Recreation Area, Linn Creek, MO.<br><br>Fort Leonard Wood currently has approximately 800 latrines (portable and permanent) not on the sanitary sewer system.  The overall requirement is to ensure collection and disposal of all sanitary refuse associated with these latrines. The requirement also includes movement of portable latrines, maintenance, cleaning, deodorizing, and winterizing of all latrines.  <br><br>There are approximately 750 one-hole portable latrines with 60 gallon capacity each; total annual collections amount to approximately 31,500.<br><br>There are approximately 50 permanent latrines (comprised of four/six/eight-hole vault latrines and septic tanks) that average 1,000 gallons in capacity each; total annual collections amount to approximately 1,000. <br><br>The Performance Work Statement and associated Technical Exhibits are attached for a more detailed description of the requirement, if needed. <br><br>*** In order for MICC-ICO-FW to accurately determine the most appropriate means of procuring these services, valuable industry input is of the utmost importance. Your responses to the following questions, and providing any other information you feel would be valuable and beneficial, will aid in MICC-ICO-FW making a determination as to the procurement approach that will maximize competition while still fulfilling the requirement in the most effective way possible. Ultimately, MICC-ICO-FW is trying to determine whether portable latrine service should be separated from permanent latrine service. <br><br>Question #1: Is your firm capable of performing all of the tasks detailed in the requirement description?<br><br>Question #2: If your answer to question #1 is no, please explain which tasks you cannot perform.<br><br>Question #3: Is there a difference in the equipment and personnel training/expertise required to service portable latrines as opposed to the equipment and expertise needed to service permanent latrine facilities (including septic tanks)?  If so, what is the difference?<br><br>Question #4: If this requirement was re-solicited as two requirements; one for the services associated with the portable latrines; and the other for the tasks associated with all other types of latrines covered by the solicitation, would your firm issue a bid/offer for both requirements?<br><br>Question #5: If the answer to question #4 is NO, why not?<br><br>Question #6: If the answer to Question #4 is YES, would the prices offered for the two separate solicitations likely be greater than the prices offered for the tasks in one solicitation? If so, please briefly explain how breaking the requirement into two smaller requirements for separate contracts might impact how you would calculate your bids/offers. <br><br>Please submit all responses, NLT 15 May 2012, to the responsible Contract Specialist, Ashley Jenkins at Ashley.m.jenkins2@us.army.mil.  <br>

<DESC>The Bureau of Public Debt, on behalf of the Office of Financial Research (OFR) intends to make award to Markit North America, LTD. on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for Markit CDS Gold, Markit RED and Markit desktop. <br />
<p><br />Pricing information on CDS contracts is a critical input to the OFR's mandate to monitor threats to financial stability. Markit is the only provider of comprehensive data on CDS pricing. Markit data uses Markit's proprietary RED codes to identify reference entities in CDS contracts and to identify specific issuances on which CDS contracts are traded. In order to analyze Markit price data in conjunction with data from other sources, the OFR requires a subscription to the RED database, which provides the translation from RED codes to the names of reference entities and issuances. The RED database also provides essential timeline information on succession events for reference entities that is necessary for any historical analysis of CDS prices, positions, and transactions.</p>
<p><br />Responses shall demonstrate they can provide a database of CDS reference entity and reference obligations data.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by May 7, 2012 by 3:00pm ET. Responses shall be submitted to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov, Attention T. Sullivan/G. Hanna.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) plans to conduct an Industry Day forum to discuss and initiate small and large business feedback on a requirement for "Customized Human Resources Solutions (CHRS)" and related acquisition strategies. OPM will conduct the forum on May 15, 2012 from 9:00 PM to 1:30 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) in the Department of Interior' auditorium. The auditorium is located at 1849 C Street NW, Washington, DC 20240. Participants in the forum can only enter through the C Street entrance. Check-in will begin at 8:30 AM and the forum will begin at 9:00 AM EST.
<p><br />The purpose of the Industry Day is to discuss the need for Customized Human Resources Solutions, provide industry with information about the upcoming acquisition and to solicit industry feedback. It is anticipated that the acquisition of CHRS services will utilize full and open competition. OPM anticipates awarding approximately 30 -40 IDIQ contracts to both small and large businesses. OPM expects partially set aside awards for small business and special categories of small businesses. The specific number of set asides has not been determined.</p>
<p>As part of industry day, the OPM Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization will facilitate a procurement matching and networking session. The procurement matching will allow both small and large business to interact and identify possible partners for the anticipated CHRS acquisition. <br />Questions will be addressed during the event, however the Government may not respond to all specific questions or comments at the forum as all details surrounding the acquisition have not been finalized. INDUSTRY DAY IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION:<br />All interested parties must pre-register to attend the forum. Walk-ins will not be permitted to attend. Registration is limited to two (2) representatives from each organization or firm. However, if the number of registrants exceeds the capacity of the auditorium, it may be necessary to further limit attendance of registrants from each organization to just one, in which case the organization will be notified. OPM will reply via e-mail with the registration confirmation. All expenses associated with attendance will be the responsibility of the participant (s). To register, email the following information to OPM-CHRS@OPM.GOV no later than 4:00 PM EST 8 May 2012.<br /><br />1. Company Name and Address (include DUNS number)<br /><br />2.

All information and discussions that take place at the Industry Day Forum will be done at the unclassified level. Each attendee will need to bring a government-issued, photographic identification to gain access to OPM. Due to security requirements, persons who did not pre-register will not be given access.</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH AND INDUSTRY FEEDBACK<br />In conjunction with this Industry Day notice, OPM is conducting market research to determine industry capability (i.e., small and large businesses) to provide Customized Human Resources Solutions services (CHRS) and to solicit comments on the draft statement of objectives. Attached to this announcement is a draft of the CHRS statement of objectives. We are asking industry to provide comments relating to the attached SOO. <br /><br />DRAFT SOO COMMENTS<br />Comments related to the draft SOO will be accepted April 30, 2012, through May 15, 2012, via e-mail only. Comments shall be mailed to OPM-CHRS@OPM.GOV. After MAY 15, 2012 the comments period will be closed. Interested parties submitting comments shall clearly identify in the e-mail subject line, "Comments to CHRS SOO". Interested parties submitting comments shall provide the following information:<br /><br />1. Name of firm representing <br /><br />2. Point of Contact (POC) within the firm submitting comments. <br /><br />3. Phone number and e-mail address for firm's POC<br /><br />In addition to the firm's general comments, OPM request responses to the following questions also: <br /><br />1. Do you believe that Section C, Statement of Objectives (SOO), Attachment 1, is sufficiently clear to allow for a concise proposal response and realistic roadmap/schedule to be developed to achieving these objectives? Are there sections that you feel are weak and need more/better clarifications? If so please identify.<br /><br />2. The SOO contains supporting details we believe will help define our current environment, processes and procedures, and notional ideas of the data requirement. Do you feel this information is useful in designing a solution? If not, please explain why? Do you believe additional information is warranted? Please explain what is missing and the value it will add if included.<br /><br />3. We are contemplating and are considering making multiple IDIQ contract awards. Awardees may be a single provider or part of a teaming effort.<br /><br />4. We are also contemplating allowing offerors to address either one of the two key service areas or both of them.<br /><br />5. Please comment on our proposed approach, identify any implications, and describe the risks and rewards associated with such an approach.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is identified&nbsp;below. The corresponding Small Business Administration size standard for these NAICS codes are based on the average annual receipts or the number of employees. In these terms, is your company a large or a small business?<br />541810 - Advertising Agencies Consulting Services, $14 million<br />541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, $14 million<br />541612 - Human Resources Consulting Services, $14 million<br />611430 Professional and Management Development Training, $7.0 million</p>
<p>While it is not mandatory that offerors provide comments or respond to the questions above, we are very interested in industry comment on the draft SOO and encourage you to submit comments. We will consider your comments and questions when finalizing the solicitation. However, we will not disclose any comments that are submitted, except as required by FAR 15.201(f). Information provided to a potential offeror in response to its request must not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the potential offeror's confidential business strategy, and is protected under 3.104 or subpart 24.2. <br /><br />OPM's anticipated contract&nbsp;duration: A one (1) year base period and four (4) option periods one year in length for a maximum contract period of performance of five (5) years. <br /><br />Most services will require performance in the Washington D.C Metropolitan area; <br />however, services may require global delivery. <br /><br />Delivery Schedule: To be determined by the offeror<br /><br />OPM expects to issue the final solicitation on or about June 25, 2012. Proposals will be due on or about July 25, 2012. An additional opportunity for questions will be offered. Our award decision will be based on a best-value determination: All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, will be significantly more important than price.</p>

<DESC>The NASA Exchange-MSFC, more commonly known as the Marshall Exchange, plans toprovide private developers an opportunity to lease federal land controlled by NASAsMarshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, in order to (1) providefood service and other quality of work life conveniences to satisfy the NASA-MSFC andsurrounding Redstone Arsenal workforce; and (2) to generate funding for the MarshallExchange to assist its purpose of providing morale, wellbeing, and recreationalactivities and events.Constraints to federal spending have significantly reduced NASAs and Redstones abilityto construct non-mission related facilities, including cafeterias or space forconcessionaire operations.  For example, MSFC recently completed the construction ofthree buildings (two engineering office buildings and one laboratory building) toreplace, modernize, and consolidate a number of old, deteriorated buildings. The threenew buildings house more than 1,100 employees. However, a planned cafeteria for the newcomplex was cancelled due to higher than expected construction costs of the officebuildings.  As a result, the Marshall Exchange plans to pursue, through appropriateprocesses and approval authorities, a long term lease with a retail developer toconstruct, manage, and operate dining and other convenience services, to provide neededfood services, improve the quality of work life, and reduce employee time away from work.The property identified for this opportunity has no planned NASA mission use and consistsof approximately 25.68 acres within a lease area defined by the propertys right-of-wayboundaries.  The property has more than 1,300 feet of footage on the south side of MartinRoad, is west of Fowler Road, and adjacent to and west of Marshalls new Building 4600complex. NASA has the authority under 51 U.S.C. 20113(c) (National Aeronautics and Space Act) tolease NASA property to others and to provide, by contract or otherwise, for cafeteriasand other necessary facilities for the welfare of employees of the Administration at itsinstallations.	Furthermore, NASA Exchanges have the authority to use and acquire realproperty and facilities to achieve Marshall Exchange objectives.Based on information provided in response to this solicitation, the Marshall Exchange,with assistance from its advisors, will select a Developer based on an objective bestvalue determination considering only the information submitted in response to thisSpecial Notice.  Following selection of a Developer, the Marshall Exchange will issue aConditional Notice of Lease award.  Next the Marshall Exchange and the Developer willcoordinate to produce a Business and Leasing Plan.  In developing the Plan, the MarshallExchange and the Developer will work together to meet the objectives of the MarshallExchange in a way to insure the Developers success in creating a long term and viableretail development.  Finally, the Marshall Exchange will work with the Developer toprepare and obtain approvals for an implementing ground lease and other documentsrequired to implement the Plan.The successful Offeror/Developer will operate and maintain the development and providecash consideration to the Marshall Exchange no less than the fair market value of theleased land.  The Marshall Exchange is confident that there is a sizeable opportunity foritself and a private developer/property manager to partner and work together to receivesignificant benefits.  Specifically, the Developer has the opportunity to receive amarket rate return from development activities, leasing of rentable square footage, andcontinuing property management of real estate assets while providing a service to meetthe Marshall Exchanges objectives.It is anticipated that an industry forum and site visit for this opportunity will beconducted on June 5, 2012 beginning at 8:15 am CDT.  The location to meet is the parkinglot of the Marshall Exchange Activities Building, Building 4316.  Prospective Offerorswill board buses from that location for briefings and site tours.  The forum is scheduledto end approximately 2:30 pm CDT.  Time for lunch at an on-site MSFC cafeteria isincluded.The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available on-line.The solicitation will be accessible from both the NASA Acquisition Internet Service(NAIS) at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov  and Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps.gov)at https://www.fbo.gov	 . It is the Offeror's/Developers responsibility to monitor the Internet site for therelease of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors/Developers willbe responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (ifany). All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing by email toedwin.jones@nasa.gov.  Telephone questions will not be accepted except in those casesnoted in the solicitation. Because this opportunity is being provided under the authority of the NASA Exchange MSFC, an instrumentality of the US Government operating with non-appropriated(non-taxpayer) funding, this opportunity will not be negotiated using Federal AcquisitionRegulations (FAR) nor NASA FAR Supplement regulations.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Services, conservation Biology Division located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with Portland State University, Department of Biology. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed contract is for procurement of non-lethal sampling protocol (fin clip) for assessment of life history traits in wild Oncorhynchus Mykiss based on gene expression and qPCR. Specifically, this project will address the following two tasks: 1.) Development of qPCR assays to assess the expression pattern of select genetic markers that can support a non-lethal sampling protocol (fin clip) for identification of life history variants in wild Oncorhynchus mykiss; and 2.) Produce a report that outlines the methods, the results, and the mode of application of a gene expression based life-history marker. Analysis of gene expression using DNA microarrays is labor intensive and requires unique technical skills and equipment. The Podrabsky laboratory of Portland State University has over a decade of experience in the development and implementation of microarray experiments in fish, including various experience with the micro array technologies. They are uniquely prepared to address the issue of gene expression markers for life history variants of O. mykiss in the Columbia River Basin. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with period of performance commencing approximately from date of award through June 30, 2012. The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $14.0M. It is the Government's belief that only Portland State University, Department of Biology can complete this project. This notice represents the only official notice.

<DESC>This RFI is part of  a multi-phase program to detect, classify and  neutralize moored and bottom mines in the Very Shallow Water (VSW) environment using unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV). Existing Mine Countermeasures (MCM) systems place man, mammal, and expensive manned systems (helicopters and ships) in a hazardous environment. Currently no unmanned system exists to neutralize mines in the VSW; the Very Shallow Water Expendable Stand Off Neutralizer (VESON) will be developed as part of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit One (EODMU1) VSW toolbox capability. The Naval Surface Warfare Center -Panama City Division (NSWC-PCD) is seeking information on commercially available, or developmental projects related to small (i.e.
 capable of being moved and/or deployed by no more than two men) unmanned underwater vehicle mine neutralization systems, equipment and technologies suitable for mine neutralization missions deployed by small craft in the Very Shallow Water (VSW) zone (10-60 feet sea water (FSW)). Specific areas of technical interest include but are not limited to: 

1.	Advanced Sensors for Precise Target Reacquisition
2.	UUV Precise Autonomous Guidance to Target Positions
3.	 Low Cost Underwater Navigation Sensors
4.	Approved  Safe and Arming Units and Enhanced Explosive Devices and for Neutralizing Mines
5.	 UUV Design and Control in Surge Environment
6.	Hydrodynamic Models for Characterization of the VSW Zone
7.	Advanced Propulsion Systems and UUV fuel cell subsystems approved for US Navy Shipboard Use for Small Underwater Vehicles.
 

Descriptive information is sought in the form of white papers, brochures, specification sheets, briefings and company points of contact. Also of interest are concepts based on existing equipment or proven technologies that are planned to become available in the 2012/2013 time frame. Limited funding is available for design proposals and demonstrations. Firms should indicate any interest or willingness to provided technology or system demonstrations when responding. 

A preliminary or Virtual Industry Day will be held in May 2012 and a Formal Industry Day in October 2012.The Formal Industry Day will be held at the Navy Memorial in Washington DC. Input received from these Industry Days will facilitate the development of a future competitive solicitation for an acquisition program in late FY 13.
 Industry input is desired to allow for an effective acquisition program with well-defined requirements in the Request for Proposal (RFP).

1.	Create reports and metadata files, in standard English, that are consistent with the standards for submissions to the library. The firm providing services must have prior knowledge of the requirements set forth in the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Recommendations XXIII-13 (Polar Record, 1995, v.31, n. 177, p. 280)
2.	Evaluate seismic profile and navigation data for internal consistency and correct all discrepancies by comparison with other proprietary data held in the SDLS archive. The firm providing services must have prior knowledge of the requirements set forth in the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Recommendations XXIII-13 (Polar Record, 1995, v.31, n. 177, p. 280).
3.	Pre-process the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG-Y) profile data to ensure that it is compatible with the proprietary OGS display software used on the SDLS Web site.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:
The following information is provided to demonstrate the proposed contractors unique qualifications:
The Antarctic Seismic Data Library System (SDLS) is a multinational repository for digital multichannel seismic reflection profile (MCS) data that facilitates the availability of such data for cooperative research.  Countries that acquire MCS data are required by: Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Recommendations XXIII-13 (Polar Record, 1995, v.31, n. 177, p. 280) to submit those data to the SDLS within four years of data acquisition.  The curator of the library, Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale (OGS) in Trieste, Italy, is responsible for documenting, standardizing, reformatting (as necessary) and otherwise preparing the submitted dataset for inclusion in the library.  The data are also published on DVD-ROM for distribution to the member libraries.  
Processing, documentation and publication of these data by OGS will ensure that the product meets the established standards for security, quality and compatibility within the library.  OGS will also ensure that all issues pertaining to data preparation, processing, storage and dissemination are coordinated with the SDLS technical advisory committee.  The data are accessible through an OGS-maintained Web site that ensures the secure access by international researchers to the database.  OGS is the only entity that has access to upload the data to the website.
This database is a singularly unique Web site, not duplicated or mirrored anywhere else:http://sdls.ogs.trieste.it/

Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal non-responsive. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges.</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>. <br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>The following FAR, DFARS, and DLAD clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition. The full text version of these clauses and provisions may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.</p>
<p>FAR 52.233-1 Disputes (Jul 2002)</p>
<p>FAR 52.233-2 Protests After Award (Aug 1996)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offers-Commercial Items. Addenda to 52.212-1; the following paragraphs are hereby deleted from this provision: (e) multiple offers and (h) multiple awards.</p>
<p>NOTE: To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104. Registration may be done on line at: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>52.211-6 -- Brand Name or Equal (Aug 1999)<br />(a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as "brand name or equal," the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified in the solicitation.<br />(b) To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must-<br />(1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation;<br />(2) Clearly identify the item by-<br />(i) Brand name, if any; and<br />(ii) Make or model number;<br />(3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and<br />(4) Clearly describe any modification the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modification.<br />(c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.<br />(d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation.<br />(End of Provision) <br />DLAD 52.233-9000 AGENCY PROTESTS (SEP 1999)</p>
<p>Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES: AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) (JUN 2001)</p>

If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here ( ). Alternate wording may be negotiated with the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>The FDA has a requirement for the development of asynchronous web-based, synchronous web-based, synchronous classroom and laboratory training with respect to the manufacture of biological therapeutic drugs.
<p>The goal of this project is to provide Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigators with a greater understanding of the manufacturing principles and processes in order to expand the scope of their inspections. Under the auspices of the FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), Division of Human Resource Development (DHRD) training program, a contractor is to provide a curriculum that will expose investigators to the typical process conducted in a biopharmaceutical facility such as equipment design, product manufacturing processes, and analytical testing methods. Courses offered will include significant instruction through distance learning technologies, followed by classroom instruction coupled with practical experience in the vendor's facilities. DHRD is interested in working with an institution that does not produce for-profit pharmaceutical products as that would create a conflict of interest. Please see the attached solicitation.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial service prepared and processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. This is a Solicitation for the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Office of Habitat Conservation (OHC), located in Silver Spring, MD is seeking a contract to provide vessel, personnel, and equipment support necessary for response and restoration in the aftermath of physical impact events (ship groundings, hurricanes, etc), active population enhancement of threatened and endangered coral species, reduction of and mitigation for land-based sources of pollution, and the implementation of coastal habitat restoration projects in the area of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Government intends to issue a Time and Materials contract with a not to exceed capacity of $950,000.00 and a period of performance of three (3) years from date of award.
<p>DOC/NOAA/NMFS/OHC interacts with NOAA/NMFS regional offices to manage, conserve and enhance habitats for fishery resources, protected species and other living marine resources, and is the focal point for marine and estuarine habitat restoration within NOAA. The Restoration Center (RC), a division of OHC, performs coastal habitat restoration pursuant to federal legislation and improves the state of restoration ecology and habitat management, and is responsible for restoring degraded habitats, advancing the science of coastal habitat restoration, transferring restoration technologies to other agencies and practitioners, and fostering habitat stewardship and a conservation ethic. In support of these responsibilities, OHC ensures that NOAA's resources are protected and restored in accordance with appropriate Acts and mandates.</p>
<p>In the US Caribbean the NOAA Restoration Center is actively addressing many resource management and conservation issues including response and restoration in the aftermath of physical impact events (ship groundings, hurricanes, etc.), active population enhancement of threated and endangered coral species, reduction of and mitigation for land-based sources of pollution, and the implementation of coastal habitat restoration projects. In addition to these activities NOAA is also often faced with logistical limitations when responding to other hazard events and/or when conducting general coral reef management and research activities. In particular NOAA often has requirements in the region to map, monitor and assess the benthic habitats, flora, and fauna; characterize oceanographic conditions; and evaluate impacts associated with land based sources of pollution.</p>
<p>While NOAA and local jurisdictions have some limited personnel and desire to respond to these impact events, we often have difficulties securing the necessary logistical support (vessel and dive support) to respond to these events in a timely manner.</p>
<p>In an effort to address the limited logistical support discussed above NOAA seeks support from a firm that can provide logistical support to the local partners and NOAA staff conducting activities in the region. See Scope of Services in attached solicitation.</p>
<p>SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: See attached solicitation and attachment for submittal requirements. To be considered, interested firms must submit the following no later than 2:00 p.m. CDT on May 22, 2012 to the following: One (1) electronic submittal package to email address jeanie.m.jennings@noaa.gov; Submissions may be faxed if email submission is not feasible. Fax to: 816-274-6947. Proposing firms are responsible for supplying information concerning each evaluation factor, including copies of any professional certifications or licenses. See Section D of the attached request for proposal for specific submission requirements.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Proposals will be evaluated by a committee of technically qualified NOAA employees assisted by bureau contracting personnel in accordance with the criteria below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>A.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Factor 1 &ndash; Technical Capabilities</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">1. Criterion 1 - Adequacy of Response.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror&rsquo;s methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the solicitation has been addressed in the proposal in accordance with the proposal submission section of the solicitation</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;">2. Criterion 2 - Feasibility of Approach.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. <strong><em>{An assessment of the degree of confidence provided by the proposed verification</em></strong> <strong><em>approaches/methods will also be included.} </em></strong>In the event that enhancements are proposed, the enhancements will be evaluated to determine whether the approach taken is feasible and will result in an end product/service that fully meets or exceeds the RFP requirements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>B.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Factor 2 &ndash; Performance Risk Evaluation</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">The Performance Risk evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the quality, relevancy and recency of the offeror's past performance, as well as that of its major subcontractors, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk rests with the offerors.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Experiment encompasses the accomplishment of work by the proposer which is comparable or related to the effort required under this procurement. Past performance indicate how well the proposer did on the earlier work.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Cost/Price factors are those factors which indicate the adequacy and realism of the cost proposal and the probable cost that will be incurred should the Government choose to contract with the proposer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">The evaluation of cost factors will include an assessment of the probable cost of doing business with each proposer during the course of the contract. It will also include a comparison with commercial industry estimate of the cost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">The importance of cost factors in the selection will depend on such consideration as the magnitude if the cost differentials between the proposal&rsquo;s and the credibility of such differentials.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Cost will not be the deciding factor when proposals are ranked in the technically acceptable range. Technical and Past Performance combined weight more than Cost.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Proposals will be evaluated by a committee of technically qualified NOAA employees assisted by bureau contracting personnel in accordance with the criteria below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>A.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Factor 1 &ndash; Technical Capabilities</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">1. Criterion 1 - Adequacy of Response.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror&rsquo;s methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the solicitation has been addressed in the proposal in accordance with the proposal submission section of the solicitation</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;">2. Criterion 2 - Feasibility of Approach.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. <strong><em>{An assessment of the degree of confidence provided by the proposed verification</em></strong> <strong><em>approaches/methods will also be included.} </em></strong>In the event that enhancements are proposed, the enhancements will be evaluated to determine whether the approach taken is feasible and will result in an end product/service that fully meets or exceeds the RFP requirements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>B.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Factor 2 &ndash; Performance Risk Evaluation</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">The Performance Risk evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the quality, relevancy and recency of the offeror's past performance, as well as that of its major subcontractors, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk rests with the offerors.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Experiment encompasses the accomplishment of work by the proposer, which is comparable or related to the effort required under this procurement. Past performance indicate how well the proposer did on the earlier work.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Cost/Price factors are those factors, which indicate the adequacy and realism of the cost proposal and the probable cost that will be incurred should the Government choose to contract with the proposer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">The evaluation of cost factors will include an assessment of the probable cost of doing business with each proposer during the course of the contract. It will also include a comparison with commercial industry estimate of the cost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">The importance of cost factors in the selection will depend on such consideration as the magnitude if the cost differentials between the proposal&rsquo;s and the credibility of such differentials.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Cost will not be the deciding factor when proposals are ranked in the technically acceptable range. Technical and Past Performance combined weight more than Cost.</p>

This approach must be sustainable - i.e., capable of continuing to achieve results after the life of activity. The market systems approach will transform targeted agricultural value chains to increase on and off-farm income at the household level. The Contractor will target a portfolio of both food and non-food agricultural crops and will address shared constraints across those agricultural value chains. The Contractor will also address essential support services that may be lacking in the targeted areas and market systems (for example, access to finance, extension services, etc.).</p>

Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.</p>
<p>When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Industrial Operations Division(IOD) Contracting Branch intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order using the procedures of FAR Part 12 and Part 13. This RFQ incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-58. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 327910. The small business size standard is 500 employees. <br />This requirement is for the following:<br />E-STRIP, GPX Blast Media<br />Type VII (Starch-g-Acrylic) blast media that meets the requirements of Military Specification MIL-P-85891A, "Plastic Media for Removal of Organic Coatings" and ALC Engineering Specification GEN 13410.07B. <br />Type VII (Starch-g-Acrylic) blast media is an environmentally friendly product used for paint removal. It is non-toxic, biodegradable. The availability of this blast media fits with the engineering concerns related to the surface alteration and/or damage often related to the use of plastic abrasive used on Coast Guard aircraft undergoing maintenance at ALC. It removes a wide variety of coatings, from common polyurethane/epoxy paint systems, to more sophisticated systems such as rain erosion resistant coatings and radar absorbing material. It also removes vinyl from aircraft interior panels, sealants form components and/or fuel cells, and paint from cadmium plated parts where the plating was left intact. Selective layer stripping without substrate damage, and that it is detectable under black lighting for easy detection during post-strip inspection, are other characteristics of this product. Its use can replace chemical and plastic bead paint stripping systems traditionally used and limits exposure of personnel to hazardous materials.
<p>In addition to the supply of the blast media, the offeror must be able to provide a spent media recycling and disposal service that meets ALC's mission of sustainable environmental stewardship.</p>

<p>Technical Capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide the unit that best meets the government's needs. Technical Capability and delivery when combined are more important than price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: Technical capability will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide starters that best meet the USCG's need. Offerors can provide any additional information necessary to fully demonstrate how their product will meet or exceed the USCG's need. The USCG will evaluate the minimum criteria listed in the specification and all additional information provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>Delivery: The government's required delivery date is 30 days after receipt of order (ARO). <br />Offerors that can meet the government's required delivery date will be rated higher than offerors that cannot meet the government's required delivery date. Offerors that can deliver sooner than the government's required date will be rated the highest. <br />Price: The offeror shall provide firm fixed pricing for the requested items. The quote should include separate line items for all available optional items. If offeror proposes F.O.B. Origin, the quote must also include estimated shipping costs for each line item. If no estimated shipping costs are not included in the bid F.O.B. Destination will be assumed. The shipping costs will be used in evaluation of price to arrive at a total cost to the government.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester shall file a formal agency protest to both the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, and the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Clause 3052.209-70<br />PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES<br />(JUN 2006)</p>

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness.

<p>(7) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a <br />Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an MLCA 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the<br />specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />(8) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>(9) METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR</p>
<p>Invoices shall be submitted to the USCG Finance Center http://www.fincen.uscg.mil/electron_cg.htm and via email to Dorothy.rawls@uscg.mil .</p>

<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation.

Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) ( ) In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) ( ) Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to respond to disasters around the world on behalf of the U.S. Government (USG), DCHA/OFDA projects itself overseas in a variety of ways.  First, DCHA/OFDA maintains six permanent regional offices in the following locations: San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; Pretoria, South Africa and Budapest, Hungary; and three sub-regional offices in Almaty, Kazakhstan; Cairo, Egypt and Jakarta, Indonesia. Second, in countries where DCHA/OFDA has a large humanitarian response portfolio, it establishes a Program Office within the USAID Mission or U.S. Embassy. Third, in the event of major disasters, DCHA/OFDA may deploy a DART to the affected country.</p>
<p>The Overseas Administration Team (OAT) is part of the Operations Division.  It was created to meet the need for administrative support and intervention as OFDA's presence in the field grew following the opening of these regional and program offices. As more staff were permanently deployed to support emergency programs in Africa and Asia, OAT's role in administrative intervention prior to and following deployment of staff has become more significant. OFDA now has 17 locations in the field that are directly supported by OAT.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of an Administrative Support Coordinator (ASC) who will provide administrative support to OFDA overseas operations at USAID Missions and Embassies worldwide.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The ASC will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide administrative support to OFDA overseas operations. Support will include assisting overseas staff with resolving administrative issues, interpreting policies and regulations, negotiating with missions and embassies, negotiating memoranda of understanding with missions and embassies, training local OFDA Foreign Service National staff, working with the local Financial Management offices and Administrative offices to facilitate the functionality of the OFDA offices;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform frequent site visits to ensure that OFDA resources are being properly utilized, assess local administrative support needs, and provide training to field administrative personnel;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide specific support for Support Relief Group (SRG) PSCs and field PSCs.  He/she will work with the contracting and financial management staff in providing appropriate domestic and field-based budgets, provide funding data for the transfer of funds, assist with clearance cables as appropriate, and brief staff on deployment;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform administrative tasks such as working with Agency's financial, acquisition and assistance systems, and with OFDA's financial planning system, review budgets and recommend funding levels of the supported overseas offices and overseas personal services contracts, send funding cables as required, and work closely with the contracting staff and the USAID Office of the Chief Financial Officer to ensure sufficient funding is available for contract renewal;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the establishment/closure of any overseas activity, that may include deployment as an Administrative Officer, assess local administrative support capabilities, assist with local procurement, and establish procedures whereby the OFDA staff interact seamlessly with USAID/Embassy personnel for the establishment of any overseas activity;</p>
<p>&bull;	Oversee the daily operation and maintenance of the SRG program by maintaining databases, and supporting the activation of SRG personnel.  This will include assisting with the development of their statements of work, facilitating their orientation to the administrative, financial, and technical operations, and monitoring the evaluation process of their performance after each activation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Coordinate with the training staff to define training requirements and assist in the preparation of training materials of SRG and OFDA field staff;</p>
<p>&bull;	Attend security management workshops and perform periodic reviews on all overseas locations for operational effectiveness;</p>
<p>&bull;	Participate on RMTs and DARTs as needed; may include deployment as an Administrative Officer;</p>
<p>&bull;	Become certified and serve as a Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) or as an Agreement Officer's Representative (AOR), as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OFDA Duty Officer on a rotational basis.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Administrative Support Coordinator will take direction from and will report to the Deputy Team Leader or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor will work together to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The following five questions and answers represent the full Q&amp;A for this RFP:
<p><strong>1.	How many employees of the 200 would be "clocking in and out" of a time keeping system?</strong></p>
<p>We have about 9 employees in the Museum sales shop that currently clock in and out.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.	Would physical clocks be needed? If so, how many?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, we have one in the Museum sales shop. We would like to keep it (we can potentially replace/upgrade the physical clock to meet software requirements)</p>
<p><strong><br />3.	If all employees are salaried - are they still needing to verify time worked or just managing schedules/vacation etc?</strong></p>
<p>Not all employees are salaried.  We have many hourly employees.  Even the salaried employee will need to have verification of time worked.</p>
<p><br /><strong>4.	When you mention tracking projects in a time keeping system - are you referencing an employee clocking in and out of a particular job, duty or location etc from a time allocation standpoint? If not, could you provide more details on the projects you would like to manage? </strong></p>
<p>USHMM has no project tracking requirements at this time, but would like to know if the proposed solution can handle multiple accounting strings per employee.</p>
<p><br /><strong>5.	Could you further clarify what time of time and attendance data would need to integrate w/ your financial system? Or are you referencing only the integration for GL purposes?</strong></p>
<p>We require bi-weekly or monthly payroll general ledger interface reporting.</p>

<p>When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>

<DESC>The acquisition of services supports the NORAD-Cheyenne Mountain Complex - Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (NCMC-ITW/AA) Program which provides ITW/AA authorities with accurate, timely, and unambiguous warning and attack assessment of Air, Missile, and Space threats. NCMC-ITW/AA is composed of Air, Space and Missile Warning Missions located at Cheyenne Mountain AFS, Offutt AFB and Vandenberg AFB's culminating in the execution of Key Performance Parameters identified as Timeliness of Assessments, Data Display Accuracy, Real or Non-Real Data Display Accuracy, Average Cumulative Unscheduled Downtime/per Month, Information Exchange Requirement-Interoperability, and Node Processing-Interoperability. The operations and support of NCMC-ITW/AA is conducted through Contractor Logistics Support and executed by the contractor. As part of annual sustainment, NCMC-ITW/AA software is upgraded through a Vertical Release process and the hardware is upgraded through a ! Technical Refresh process.The systems consist of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software. Specialized applications have been developed, updated and maintained, that provide classified communications and processing capability at various military sites, world-wide. The Government is managing the support of the baseline system while integrating required software and hardware modifications and a technical refresh program. This requirement provides for internal integration among the architecture, as well as for external integration of these systems with other C2 systems (e.g., Space Situational Awareness, SKIWEB, SIPRNet, MILSTAR, DSCS, GCCS, etc.).

<DESC><p><strong>Description:<br /></strong>The 92d Contracting Squadron will be soliciting for a competitive 8(a), Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build (up to 35%) construction efforts to support the 92d CES mission at Fairchild AFB, Washington. <br />Individual task order work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task order limits will be $2,500 to $650,000. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed $7M over a two-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and one 12-month option period.<br />Work to be performed under the MATOC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings, size standard $33.5M; Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $33.5M; and Subsection 238 Specialty Trade Contractors, size standard $14M.&nbsp;The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement/removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, and paving. Locations of work will be at Fairchild AFB, WA and other associated sites outside the base proper. All off base sites are within 80 miles of Fairchild AFB. Offers are solicited only from small business concerns who are expressly certified for participation in the 8(a) program; and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan. <br />It has been determined that competition will be limited to 8(a) firms located within the geographical area of Region 10, and other 8(a) construction firms with a bona fide place of business within the Region 10 geographical competitive area, and the assigned NAICS code.&nbsp; All other 8(a) BD Participants are deemed ineligible to submit offers.&nbsp; <br /><strong>Evaluation:<br /></strong>Each offeror's proposal will be evaluated utilizing best value source selection procedures. The basis for award is to be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) without technical factors. The procedures described in FAR Part 15.3, AFFAR 5315.3, Policy Memorandums 11-C-04 and 11-C-07 and source selection procedures will be utilized. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a seed project. The magnitude of the seed project is less than $25,000. The offeror's Past Performance will be considered approximately equal in importance to the Seed Project's Price. The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror possesses sufficient past performance experience for relevant construction projects that range from $50K to $500K. Also, all offeror's shall show the capability of receiving $3M in bonding annually. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.

<DESC><p>This is a Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information, for planning purposes, regarding: (1) the availability and capability of potential sources that can provide the required services described below and (2) the size classification of the available and potential sources relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The NAICS code for this planned acquisition is 541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. Your response to the information requested will assist the Social Security Administration (SSA) in planning the appropriate acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Congress established the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (TTW) with the hope of increasing access to employment services for disability beneficiaries from a range of innovative providers. Under TTW, the Social Security Administration (SSA) provides beneficiaries with a Ticket akin to a voucher that they may use to obtain vocational rehabilitation, employment, or other support services from participating providers called Employment Networks. These providers receive payments from SSA if the beneficiaries they serve achieve successful employment outcomes. <br />To evaluate the TTW program, SSA needed data not available in SSA administrative records. Consequently, SSA developed the National Beneficiary Survey (NBS) to provide this information on representative samples of SSA beneficiaries receiving disability benefits.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to redesign and implement three new waves of the NBS <br />Under this project, the basic structure of the NBS will change modestly to collect fewer details on specific aspects of the TTW program, and more information on the factors associated with successful and unsuccessful work attempts.<br />See the attached draft SOW:</p>
<p>Response Information:<br />In order for SSA to asses a firm's capability, firms must submit a response that provides enough detail to indicate that it can provide the services that meet the requirements identified above.</p>
<p>SSA also seeks industry comment on the draft SOW. When submitting comments on the Draft SOW you need to identify the Section of the SOW your comment applies to such as:</p>
<p>Draft SOW Task 2, concerning kickoff meeting.</p>
<p>Comment: State your comment, questions, clarification, etc.</p>
<p><br />Vendor submissions of simple marketing materials or brochures, incomplete responses that do not conform to the elements of this request for information, or references to vendor websites will not be considered by SSA.</p>
<p>With your response, please include:</p>
<p>a. DUNS number<br />b. Company Name<br />c. Company Address<br />d. Current GSA Schedules appropriate to this notice<br />e. Type of Company (i.e. large business, small business, small disadvantaged, women owned, HUBZone, and Service Disabled) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration<br />f. Company point of contact, phone and email address</p>
<p>All responses must be submitted in an electronic form via e-mail to the Contracting Officer at Christopher.Brennan@ssa.gov no later than May 9, 2012 at 12:00 pm. Reponses will not be accepted after the due date. Responses must not exceed twenty (20) pages. The file size limitation for e-mail attachments is 5 MB. Faxed information will not be considered. SSA will not accept phone calls regarding this notice.</p>
<p>Disclaimer:</p>
<p>This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by SSA to award a contract. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with your submittal. SSA will not return any information submitted in response to this notice. Information received will be used in SSA's market research effort and for procurement planning purposes. The Government reserves the right to contact, or not to contact, any party responding to this notice in order to obtain further information for market research purposes. Respondents are advised that SSA is under no obligation to provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>Confidentiality:</p>
<p>No proprietary, confidential, sensitive information should be included in your response. SSA reserves the right to use any non-proprietary information in any resultant solicitation.</p>

  E.1  52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
 
   (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation factors below. The Government intends to award without discussion with respective offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The Government however, reserves the rights to conduct discussion if deemed to be in its best interest. Furthermore, if discussions are to be conducted the Government will establish a competitive range. The competitive range shall be comprised of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency pursuant to FAR 15.306 (c) (2). The evaluation factors used to evaluate offers are as follows:

    Technical Acceptability
    Past Performance
    Price
 
   Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.
 
   (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
 
   (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

                         (End of Provision)
 
   (e) EVALUATION APPROACH
 
 1. TECHNICAL:
 
 (i) Assessment:  The Government will assess each area of the technical proposal to ensure the offeror meets or exceeds the standards of the contract.  The Government will evaluate the technical proposal based on the information provided in the Technical Volume.  The Government will infer from the offeror's responses to the required information the offeror's capability to perform to the requirements of the entire SOW.  In order to be considered for award, the offeror must demonstrate the ability to provide adequate and qualified staff and expertise to satisfy the statement of work requirements by describing or providing the information requested in the Technical Volume
 
  2.  PAST PERFORMANCE:
 
 (i) Factor Assessment: The purpose of Past Performance evaluation is to assess the degree of confidence the Government will have in an Offeror's ability to provide services that meet customer needs.  The Past Performance evaluation will assess how relevant the Offeror's contracts on previous efforts of similar size and scope to this acquisition have been rated by their customers.  The evaluation will focus on and target performance that is relevant to the principal tasks of the SOW, (i.e. providing annual preventive maintenance services for Arjo Patient Lifting Devices as stated in the SOW).   More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the performance confidence assessment than less recent and/or less relevant effort.  A performance confidence rating will be assigned based on the offeror's ability to perform the requirements of this solicitation
 
  (ii)  Description of factor:
 
 (A) The Government will conduct a past performance review of each competitive offeror.  Evaluations will be based on present and past performance information provided by the Offeror and gathered from various sources.  In addition to the information provided by the Offeror's customers, the Government reserves the right to use data obtained from other Government and commercial sources.
 
 (B) Recent:  A contract is considered recent when performance of the effort is ongoing or has been completed within the past 3 years.  Current performance will have a greater impact in the confidence assessment than less recent performance.
 
 (C) Relevancy:  The government will perform an independent determination of data relevancy, provided or obtained.  The main assessment of relevancy focuses on capability and magnitude.  Capability assesses whether the work being performed in the reference is similar to the work in our requirement.  Magnitude defines whether the amount of work in the reference is similar to the amount of work in our requirement.  An effort is considered relevant when there is a logical connection with document destruction services.  The scope of past performance information in value and size shall also be considered in determining relevancy.   More relevant performance will have a greater impact on the confidence assessment than less relevant effort.
 
 (D) Performance:  The government will perform an independent determination for each contract reference, provided or obtained.
 
 (iii) A lack of relevant past performance information shall be rated as an unknown performance risk, having no positive or negative significance.  A strong record of relevant or semi-relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than a "Neutral/Unknown confidence" rating.  Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance.
 
 (v) Where the performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems.  The Government will also consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised) to resolve problems.  Offerors will have the opportunity to address any negative or adverse past performance information received during this evaluation (subject to the restrictions of FAR 15.306 (e) (4), for which they have not had an opportunity to address in the past.
 
 3. PRICE:
 
 (i) Factor Assessment:  This criteria evaluates the overall price (i.e. aggregate for all five years of performance) to determine if the proposed price is fair and reasonable.  The Government may determine an offer unacceptable if the proposed prices are materially unbalanced which is defined as significantly understated or overstated in relation to the actual cost of that work or when the price is determined not to be fair and reasonable.

<FOJA>Follow-on Delivery Order Following Competitive Initial Order
<AWDNBR>TCC07HQD0052
<DONBR>120018
<DESC><p>This notice is in accordance with FAR 5.301 and FAR 16.505<br /><br />Contracting Agency<br /><br />Office of the Comptroller of the Currency<br />250 E Street SW, Washington, DC 20219<br /><br />Description of Action- The Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) Management Application Services Delivery (MASD) requires continued project support from TeraThink Corporation (TeraThink) for the Personnel Administration and Security System (PASS) project (formerly known as the Critical Infrastructure Protection and Security Personnel Tracking System, or CIPS PTS). The contracting action to which this exception applies will award a follow-on task order to TeraThink to provide said project support. The task order will be awarded on a sole-source basis under an exception to the fair opportunity process for orders under multiple award contracts as provided for in Section H.1 of the contract.</p>
<p>Description of Supplies or Services- The follow-on task order includes support for business process analysis, requirements analysis, design, and testing to fully integrate PASS with the Treasury's Identity and Access Management Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Data Synchronization (PDS) solution. The follow-on task order also includes support for business process analysis, requirements analysis, design, and testing as part of ongoing operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) activities for PASS. See the performance work statement (PWS) for a complete description of the services and deliverables required under the task order.</p>
<p>Authority Cited- FAR 16.505 (b) (2) (iii) "The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order."</p>
<p>Reason for Authority Cited- (a) Background: In September 2008, the OCC awarded TeraThink a task order (TCC-07-HQ-D-0052/TCC-08-HQ-0004) to provide support to the PASS project. The task order was awarded after a competitive task order award process involving all three holders of the OCC Program Management Office Support (PMOS) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. The scope of the original task order included tasks for the first phase of the PASS system-development process; (b) Justification: The scope of the work for the follow-on task order constitutes "logical follow-on" to the original task order, its scope being downstream tasks typical in the system development process. Furthermore, as noted in the background, all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order. Finally, because TeraThink has executed project support tasks for the first phase of the project and all subsequent phases thereafter, their team has in-depth knowledge of the project, the business processes related to the project, and the PASS system. That experience makes it unlikely that another PMOS awardee could complete the follow-on work as quickly and at a lower cost than TeraThink. Therefore, in the interest of economy and efficiency, the task order should be awarded on a sole-source basis, outside of the fair opportunity process.</p>
<p>Award was made 4/30/2012</p>
