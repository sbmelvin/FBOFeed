<DESC>Purpose of Announcement: In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System, Section 3.2.2.4 Single Source Selection, this announcement is to inform the public/industry of the FAA's intention to procure the High Reach Extendable Turret (HRET) from a selected source via sinfle source procedures. The William J. Hughes Technical Center intends to enter into a single source award with Crash Rescue Equipment, Inc. located in Dallas, Texas.The decision to contract on a sole source basis with Crash Rescue Equipment Inc. is based on the fact that they are the original source of supply for the HRET.  Crash Rescue is the current producer of the Snozzleâ„¢ technology, which was the first HRET, developed for the Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) industry.  At this time Crash Rescue is the only manufacturer that is producing a HRET that will be capable of meeting the FAA's requirements. A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. If your firm disagrees with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your company's capabilities and experience in providing equipment listed above and the FAA will evaluate the information accordinly. All responses to this announcement shall be directed to Jerry Hendricks, Contracting Officer, received by 4:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, May 25, 2005. E-Mail responses are encouraged or mail to FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Contracts Brach ACX-52, Atlantic City International Airport, New Jersey 08405. All inquires to be submitted via e-mail only. See Technical Specification/Req. Below.  With the arrival of the Airbus A380 aircraft into commercial service in early 2006 and other future NLA aircraft, the FAA needs to establish the best performance criteria for optimal and safe next generation HRET operations around all aircraft including second level aircraft.  Expected results include:  determining performance criteria and techniques needed to penetrate second level aircraft, determining maximum standoff distance needed to operate a next generation HRET effectively, and determine solutions for discharge reactive forces that affect HRETs and optimum discharge pressures.   TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION The next generation HRET device shall be mounted on the FAA ARFF Research Program's new research vehicle.  The vehicle will be certified by the manufacturer to meet or exceed the requirements of FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 150/5220-10C Guide Specification for Water/Foam Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Vehicles.  The intent of this contract is to maintain the vehicle to the original operational specifications as close as possible.  It is understood that some minor modifications to the host vehicle may be necessary during installation of the next generation HRET.  The device will be used for FAA testing of next generation HRET performance and will require modifications after installation in order to determine most effective operational ranges.  These modifications can be to the physical structure of the HRET, the programming of the computer controls and/or the electrical systems.   TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS Â·	The HRET shall be permanently mounted on an Oshkosh, Striker 3000, 6 x 6 ARFF vehicle. Â·	The next generation HRET shall meet or exceed the requirements within AC 150/5220-10C, Guide Specification for Water/Foam Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Vehicles. Â·	The next generation HRET shall meet or exceed the requirements within the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 414, Aircraft Rescue and Fire-Fighting Vehicles. Â·	The next generation HRET shall comply with Chapter 18 of NFPA 1901, Standard for Automotive Fire Apparatus.    Â·	The next generation HRET shall be capable of penetrating the second level skin of the fuselage at a height of 35 feet above ground level from a minimum standoff distance of 35'.  The next generation HRET shall be capable of reaching into the second level passenger doorway at a height of 30 feet above ground level from a minimum standoff distance of 30 feet and flow foam/water at a rate of at least 250 gallons per minute.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Ion Storage Group has a requirement to cut, grind and polish Government supplied ultra-low expansion (ULE) cavity spacers. The Ion Storage Group at NIST is conducting research toward the development of the next-generation, time and frequency standards. Part of that research effort is directed toward assessing the feasibility of frequency and time standards that are based on narrow optical transitions in single, laser-cooled ions. Critically important to these studies are ultra-stable lasers whose linewidths are substantially smaller than 1 Hz for averaging times from 1 to 10 s.  So far, these linewidths have been obtained only by locking the frequency of the clock laser to a well-isolated cavity. However, in addition to careful isolation of the cavity against environmental perturbations, it is also essential that the cavity be properly cut and polished in order that it has the dimensional stability to support the short- to medium-term laser-stability required. In order that the frequency of the cavity-stabilized laser not fluctuate by more than 1 Hz (or even less), the cavity length must not change by more than 1 part in 10 to the 15th power of its length. NIST has tried various vendors throughout the years and so far, none has been able to duplicate cavities with the same dimensional stabilities that are routinely achieved by Research Electro-Optics, Inc. (REO).  In fact, REO is the main source of reference cavities that are used for optical clock research throughout the international community at large, including NRC (Canada), NPL (England) and PTB (Germany).  Also REO has a long history of manufacturing ULE reference cavities of all sizes and finesse levels and has developed a unique capability to prepare the spacer ends for the optical contacting of the mirrors to the cavity. This process is proprietary to REO and involves not only polishing and annealing, but other processes as well that preserve the dimensional stability and the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) of the spacer. 

NIST Proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with Research Electro-Optics, Inc., 5505 Airport Blvd. Boulder, CO 80301 a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Under $100,000). Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or email. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.

The information is to include, but not be limited to, uses for tax credits, California’s Health Insurance Premium Payment Program, Income Support programs and health and work demonstration projects.  The website will also include a Benefits Calculator which can be used to calculate the effects of changes in earned income on Federal and State of California programs.  All work is to be accomplished within 32 months of the contract award date.  The website is required to have the following salient characteristics (1) A text-based menu to ensure that individuals with readers will have an easier time reading the menu versus reading one that is graphics-based.  While there may be a graphics menu, it must be in addition to, not as a substitute for, the text-based menu. (2) Easy-to-use sitemap and search capabilities. (3) Easy-to-view color scheme with fonts that are clear and readable, (4) All graphics, regardless of significance, are to have ALT tags, describing the graphics.

(7)  Work across browsers (work properly in Internet Explorer and Netscape).  (8)  Resolution of 800x600 dpi.  (9)  The website is required to have a Spanish language version.  The website home page is to have a link written in Spanish, directing Spanish-speakers to that portion of the website.  This may be accomplished by having a link on all pages (as Part of the menu), a more significant marker on the index, or other means (10) The website(s) will meet or exceed W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 draft as it currently exists.  See http;//www.w3.org/TR/WCA20/). (11) The website is to provide feedback features to permit users to submit comments on any aspect (technical or programmatic) of the website.  (12) The website must contain a forum section regarding any Federal or state disability issue/program pertinent to California.  (13) The website must be compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  (14)  The Benefits Calculation Engine shall be transparent to the user.  (1)  The Benefits Planning Scenarios, as well as other web pages, are to be in both English and Spanish.  The website is to provide various scenarios (minimum of six) which will provide individuals with information on the effect on benefits/benefit eligibility that occurs as a result of a new job, earnings change, change in marital status, and other changes to financial circumstances.   The Benefits Calculation Engine will respond to data input by the user in theses scenarios and will provide benefit calculations based on changes outlined in the scenario.  A solicitation will not be issued.  SSA will not respond to solicitation copies and will not pay for information received in response to this announcement.  Responses must provide sufficient information for SSA to determine that an organization other than World Institute on Disability can provide the above services.  The vendor/company must provide information that it has developed a Benefit Calculator Engine as well as experience in providing web-based disability information/data.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

However, all proposals received within fifteen business days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Microarray Facility, Advanced Technology Center (ATC) plans to procure on a sole source basis for Human Genome Oligo Set V3.0 oligonucleotide sets with Qiagen, Operon Biotechnologies Division, 2705 Artie Street, Building 400, Huntsville, Alabama.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  Some of the ATC’s missions are the manufacturing of quality micro-arrays for comprehensive gene expression analysis, providing training protocols and technical support to the NCI researchers and developing new micro-array technologies and applications.  High density DNA micro-array technology has been used to achieve high throughput analysis of massively parallel genomic sequences.  These high density DNA micro-arrays have been used to perform expression studies, re-sequencing experiments, and genotype analysis on the genes of human, mouse, and other organisms.  Qiagen/Operon is the only known source that can provide a large sent of unique 70 base pair nucleotides containing amine groups at their 5’ ends.  Qiagen/Operon has assembled a large number of unique sequences in stock over 20,000 of the aforementioned oligonucleotides for human genes and more than 16,000 for the mouse.  Qiagen/Operon is the only company that offers large oligonucleotide sets of 70 bases (70mers) that can be used for complex expression studies.  Since significant work has been done using Qiagen oligonucleotides, they are believed to be the only ones which will maintain compatibility and allow comparison of experimental results without introducing new variables.  Qiagen/Operon is the only known source to the NCI researcher that can provide the aforementioned oligonucleotides and has as large a number of unique sequences in stock.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on June 1, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.

<DESC>The most recent Small Business Economic Trends published by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) continues to list the cost and availability of insurance as the single most important problem for small business.  Although is it below its high from a year ago, nearly twice as many respondents choose it as their top problem compared to the second biggest issue, taxes.  Health insurance as a problem has surfaced within the last two years as three years ago the cost and availability of health insurance was not even in the top three problems of the NFIB survey.This concern is testimony of how pricing and availability of health care plans are impacting small businesses offering of health insurance.  Over the last two years, employees of small firms (fewer then 500 employees) experienced a drop in employer health insurance offerings, from 44 percent to 43 percent (special tabulations using the U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, March Supplement).  (Note that large firm employees had a similar decline from 68 percent to 67 percent.)  Similar findings can be found in the annual Kaiser Family Foundation’s annual survey on health employer benefits.  This widely quoted source also shows that employer-sponsored health insurance premiums rose 11.2 percent between 2003 and 2004 – the fourth consecutive year of double-digit gains.
The Office of Advocacy seeks research to study the small business health insurance issue.  Proposals should use datasources that focus on the firm size or the entirety of the business, not establishment size (or business location) data. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting officer (billy.jenkins@sba.gov).  Fax proposals will not be accepted

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Unless you are a vendor who submitted a proposal in connection with this solicitation last year (in which case you will be receiving a fax along these lines sometime the week of 5/23/05), please do NOT contact us regarding these services or this solicitation... there's little point.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.
(b). Definitions.   As used in this clause.
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a “Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1).  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct of indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2).  After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i).  In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii). In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3).  The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.   
(c.) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1). Certain Stock Disregarded.  For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i). Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii.) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.
(2) Plan Deemed in Certain Cases.  If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.  The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.  For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1). Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i). Warrants;
(ii). Options;
(iii). Contracts to acquire stock;
(iv). Convertible debt instruments; and
(v). Others similar interests.
(2). Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure.
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that its not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>The Tongass National Forest is soliciting for offers for the Kosciusko Stewardship project. Primary purposes of this project include second growth commercial timber removal, maintenance of existing roads, and restoration of previously logged over areas.  To accomplish these goals, this project combines commercial timber removal from previously logged over areas with road maintenance and thinning activities. <br><br>

Timber removal will only take place in identified units.  Approximately 1,344 CCF of cut tree marked second growth commercial timber within a 50 acre unit. <br><br>

Pre-commercial thinning of approximately 25 acres.<br><br>

Road maintenance activity including surface maintenance of approximately 10 miles, brushing of approximately 14 miles, hourly equipment/operator use of an excavator, crawler tractor and dump truck, installation or replacement of road markers/signs.  Road reconstruction activities are involved also with estimate price range of between $25,000 and $100,000.  The primary NAICS code for the resulting contracting will fall under road construction type activities as the majority of the value of the contract will reflect that activity.<br><br>


The resulting contract incorporates a Task Order Resource Services and Construction contract with provisions for Timber Removal. This is a multi-year contract with performance from date of award through five years.  In event that the costs of the services exceeds the value of the timber products removed and/or the appropriated funds, the cancellation dates required by Federal Acquisition Regulation 17.106-1 will be mutually arrived at.<br><br>

The project is located on Kosiusko Island in southern southeast Alaska off the northwest coast of Prince of Wales Island.  There are no commercial services available on Kosciusko Island.   Access to the island is by float plane or boat.  Kosciusko Island is not served by regular commercial boat, barge or air service but such transportation can be acquired through charter.  The nearest full service community is Ketchikan, Alaska located approximately 60 air miles to the east. <br><br>

The solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps on or about June 3, 2005.<br><br>
Potential offerors are requested to the solicitation from the Internet if at all possible.  Alternatively, a hard copy of the solicitation documents may be requested via fax at 907.228.6254.  Fax requests should reference solicitation R10-05-05-26.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  Offers will be due approximately 30 calendar days after the solicitation issue date.

The Site Vist will be held at 10 AM on all three dates set forth above.

However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies, based upon the criteria specified herein, are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service (USPS) is conducting this prequalification solicitation in an attempt to identify the suppliers that will compete for future Designated Fuel Supplier (DFS) contracts across the United States.  A DFS is generally defined as a refiner, wholesale marketer, super jobber or any qualified petroleum company authorized and properly licensed to sell or resell refined petroleum products throughout the continental United States.  Tanks in this program are owned by independent USPS contractors, and range in capacity from 500 to greater than 10,000 gallons.  They are situated both above and underground; many have the ability to accept truckload deliveries, however some require special accommodations such as pump trucks to receive fuel. (While preference will be given to suppliers that can provide fuel in less than truckload quantities as required, they will not be disqualified on this basis.) Fuel may also be required to be provided FOB the respective terminal storage loading facility in full petroleum tank loads, minimum 7000-7500 gallons of diesel fuel. The Postal Service is primarily interested in prequalifying suppliers with existing operations that can provide or be modified to provide the products and services described in this document.  Suppliers who meet the prequalification criteria will be those who have demonstrated their ability to perform consistently to high standards of quality and reliability.

Solicitations requiring a prequalified supplier will be advertised only to suppliers on the prequalification list.  The Postal Service policy requires adequate competition and reserves the right to advertise such solicitations to all or a portion of the prequalified suppliers.   Future solicitations may be published only to those suppliers on the prequalified list.  However, being listed as a prequalified supplier does not guarantee that a supplier will be awarded a future contract.  In addition, the Postal Service reserves the right to use non-prequalified suppliers when circumstances dictate this to be an appropriate action that is in the best business interests of the Postal Service.

Potential Offerors having objections to non-Government personnel participating in the evaluation of proposals and/or contract documentation including resultant contract administration activities shall contact the PCO prior to submitting their proposals.  

J.	BASIS FOR AWARD:  Contract award decisions, if any, will be based on an evaluation of which proposals or parts of proposals best further the Government objectives in the GPS OCX PRDA effort and on the availability of funding.  The Government intends to make multiple awards with one small business set-aside.  The selection of none, one, or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each Offeror’s proposal (both technical and cost/price aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the GPS OCX PRDA.  Proposals are evaluated solely on the criteria published in this PRDA.  The proposals will be evaluated based on the following two criteria that are listed in descending order of importance.  No other evaluation criteria will be used.  Each criterion will be evaluated concurrently.


CRITERIA I

Mission Capability
The Offeror’s proposal will be evaluated separately for both technical content and program management on how well the proposal will achieve the overall PRDA objectives.  The evaluation will focus on the understanding demonstrated and the effectiveness of the Offeror’s proposed solution for:

a.	Offeror’s understanding of the technical scope and approach in accomplishing the objectives of the SOO and execution of the CSOW
b.	Degree of innovation displayed (balanced by lessons learned, best practices, and proven technologies)
c.	Management approach to accomplish the objectives of the SOO and execution of the CSOW
d.	Approved subcontracting goals (as applicable)

CRITERIA II

Cost/Price: Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles.  Although an important discriminator, Mission Capability is significantly more important than Cost/Price.  The Offeror’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated using one or more of the techniques in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is reasonable and realistic.

No other evaluation criteria will be used.  The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated concurrently.

The Evaluation Teams will produce and document findings that thoroughly identify and describe strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies associated with each Offeror’s proposal when evaluated against each evaluation criteria.  Any information or data incorporated by reference or referral will not be considered.

Mission Capability Technical Merit ratings will be rated: Outstanding – a significant or exceptional aspect of an Offeror’s proposal that has merit and exceeds expectations in a way beneficial to the Air Force and will be included in the contract or inherent in an Offeror’s process; Good – meets expectations; Marginal – aspect of or omission from proposal that may contribute to a failure in meeting specified minimum objectives; Unacceptable – materiel failure to meet objectives; or Unique – may not meet all Air Force objectives but offers a unique innovation that justifies special consideration.  Mission Capability  Program Management will be rated Acceptable – Yes or No. Cost/Price rating will be Reasonableness (“Yes” or “No”) and Realism (“Yes” or “No”).

K.	DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: The delivery address for proposals is: SMC/GPK (Attn: Carol Laechelt), Los Angeles Air Force Base, 2400 South Pacific Avenue, Building 410, Fort MacArthur, San Pedro CA 90731.

Complete proposals must be received by 1200 hours (noon) on Tuesday, 21 June 2005 Pacific Daylight Time.  Offerors shall pre-coordinate delivery time with either the PRDA PCO (Carol Laechelt) or the PRDA Deputy Program Manager (Capt Grant Leeds).

L.	AWARD NOTIFICATION: The PCO will notify Offerors whose proposals have not been selected for negotiation/award as soon as possible.  When a proposal is not selected for award, an Offeror may submit a written request for pre-award debriefing in accordance with FAR 15.505(a).  Any post-award debriefing of Offerors shall be accomplished in accordance with FAR 15.506.

M.

Any assertions of technical data rights shall be made in Attachment 5 of the Model Contract in the form provided.

N.	PROGRAMMATICS:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from the Offeror or potential Offeror during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered “significant concerns” and shall be communicated directly to the PCO.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the PCO, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Col Roc Myers, (310) 363-1222.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

<DESC>PLEASE NOTE CORRECTION OF POC EMAIL ADDRESS.  CORRECT POC EMAIL ADDRESS IS:  Laura.Barraza@dla.mil.         

The Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC) seeks expression of interest regarding DSCC’s desire to establish a Government supply contract for various “kitting” projects.  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) definition of kitting is “two or more assorted items issued as a single item of supply”.  The kit will have a Bill of Material and be used for a specific purpose. A kit will also consist of government approved components assembled in government approved packaging to be supplied to a storage depot or directly to the customer.
 
Delivery destinations would include Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) depots and direct vendor delivery locations for Military bases located in the United States and worldwide.

This prospective initiative will encompass multiple NSNs of various types, with a potential to add items over the life of the contract(s).   This initiative anticipates a Request for Proposal (RFP), utilizing Best Value Source Selection criteria to award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract(s).  Multiple awards are possible.  The type of contract contemplated for this program is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) or Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment (FP w/EPA) Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) with one or more option periods of one or more years.   Standard long term contracts at DSCC are for a one year base period with four (4) one year options for a total contract length of five (5) years.  Suggestions for other long term arrangements will be considered.

The Government seeks information on vendors’ capabilities and ideas for providing supply support.  Depending upon the nature of the responses to this request, the Government will determine such things as acquisition strategy, source selection criteria, production lead times and economic order quantities.  Each contract entered into under this prospective program will include surge and wartime readiness sustainment requirements.  We anticipate the use of Electronic Commerce.

Topics that vendors may wish to comment on include, but are not limited to:

•	The overall feasibility and cost effectiveness of such an initiative
•	Any Economic order quantities that lend themselves to price breaks
•	Recommendations for use of existing Government furnished material
•	Industry capabilities for long term support. 
•	If required, how would you help develop and configure a new kit?
•	How would you deal with kit components that have a First Article Test (FAT), Critical Safety applications (CSI) or Shelf Life requirements?
•	How do you monitor and make configuration changes?
•	What would be the best method for acquiring sole source or long lead-time items?
•	Would you buy from DLA if DLA offers the best deal in respect to price and/or delivery?
•	What recommendations would you make if required to buy DLA managed kit components?
•	Can you supply special packaging?
•	Do you have a plan for handling surge demands?
•	If customer requires services other than supplying actual kits, can you do that?  (Such as stocking bins,  re-ordering material,  etc.)  
•	What other services in conjunction with kitting would you recommend? 

The Contractor will be required to deliver final products which will conform to the requirements cited in the Procurement Item Descriptions.

Responses to this request that indicate that the information therein is proprietary or represents confidential business information will be received and held in confidence for U. S. Government only.  However, DSCC’s intent is to develop an RFP with consideration to the aggregate of the information provided from industry as a whole.  

All respondents to this notice, who have not opted out, will automatically be placed on a mailing list to receive the RFP upon it’s issuance.  

Please provide written responses (emails are authorized) to the following POC:

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-ORDC-05-01
<RESPDATE>122004
<CONTACT>Darrick Early, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-401-3693, Fax 202-690-7412, Email darrick.early@hhs.gov
<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The Federal Response Plan of the Department of Homeland Security designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response to man-made or natural disasters. In 2002, HHS established the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP). This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies threatening the civilian population. The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for response to a public health emergency. *** DESCRIPTION *** This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. The Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), also referred to as radiation sickness, is an acute illness caused by irradiation of the entire or a significant portion of the body by a high dose of penetrating radiation in a relatively short time period (minutes).  This exposure results in the depletion of hematopoetic stem cells and progenitors, resulting in severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  Severe neutropenia can significantly increase an individual’s susceptibility to lethal infections, while thrombocytopenia increases the risk of hemorrhage.  Currently there are no approved therapeutics to mitigate ARS.   The Government has an interest in identifying sources of therapeutics likely to be effective in preventing or reducing the development of neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia when administered at times after acute exposure to radiation.  The Government is particularly interested in identifying therapeutics that are effective when given several hours to days after exposure.    Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DHHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy to meet the Nation’s bioterrorism defense needs. Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit a capability statement to the DHHS. Submitted information should include: a) a description of the product including relevant chemical, physical chemical or immunological characteristics; b) a description of the mechanism of action of the product; c) a description of the proposed formulation, dosage and route of administration; d) a statement of the proposed indications for use; e) a statement of the proposed production process and the current state of validation or GMP compliance; f) an estimate of production capacity and timelines, and estimated cost; g) a product development plan for GMP production, animal and human studies; and h) the overall stage of product development including the current status of preclinical and clinical safety and efficacy studies. All information submitted to DHHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. Information must be submitted by December 20, 2004. Responses should be limited to 25 pages and are preferred in electronic format and can be e-mailed to the attention of the technical contact person: Marissa A. Miller, DVM, MPH, ORDC, Phone 202/690-6013, email Marissa.Miller@hhs.gov. Please ensure that at least TWO (2) COPIES of all responses are submitted: one to the technical contact person, Marissa A. Miller, and one to the primary contracting point of contact, D. Andre Early. 

Under provisions laid out in the Project BioShield Act of 2004, future competition may be limited to sources responding to this request for information (Sec. 319F-2(c)(7)(C)(vii) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 274d-6b).

They must be capable of recording information by seconds, minutes, hours or days and synchronizing time and date when downloaded to PDAs or laptop computers.  Dataloggers must be compatible with Windows XP and Windows Pocket PDA software.
 

Justification for Sole Source Procurement:

The NRCS National Soil Survey Center recommends the Global Water water level sensor or logger to monitoring water table levels.  NRCS Southeast Soil Survey Region (MO-15) is using Global Water sensors in a regional soil water study.  MO-15 has developed a methodology for installing and operating these sensors to develop defensible and consistent data regarding hydric soils, soil moisture and related soil-water properties (see attached workplan).  Global Water sensors have been tried and proven by NRCS in other areas to accurately measure water tables and soil moisture.  

This equipment has already been purchased for use in Klamath County by the soil survey party leader.  By using the same equipment for both the Sprague River CEAP study and the soil survey insures data compatibility so results are interchangeable and consistent.  This way data from both studies can be used to complement each other.  Also by using the same equipment, we will be able to use the same field personnel, computer hardware and software for downloading data in the field for both studies.  This will save the agency time and money, as well as improving the quality and quantity of data.

A review of other water level and soil moisture sensor manufactures was conducted.  No alternative source was identified that could meet all the specifications needed.

                    WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

 1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
 be:

 *  an existing published wage determination
 *  a survey underlying a wage determination
 *  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
    a wage determination matter
 *  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

 On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
 for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
 Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
 because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
 Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
 contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
 and 3.) should be followed.

 With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
 process described here, initial contact should be with the
 Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

        Branch of Construction Wage Determinations

        Wage and Hour Division

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
 interested party (those affected by the action) can request
 review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
 (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

        Wage and Hour Administrator

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
 interested party's position and by any information (wage
 payment data, project description, area practice material,
 etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

 3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
 interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
 Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

        Administrative Review Board

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

AMENDMENT 2.

Q6. Is this solicitation for the installation of the devices ONLY or does it include the manufacturing of the attachments?
A6.Installation and manufacturing of the attachments

Q7. How long after 2 June will the contract be awarded ? Hence, what is the actual manufacturing cumulative time for manufacturing?
A7. Depending on the number of competitive offers that we receive will depend on the technical evaluation timeline.  I forsee the award being made no later than 6 June which should give you about 14 days to complete and meet the required date of 20 June.

Q8. When will the vehicles be available to begin modification ?
A8. As soon as the award is made. Reference question 7 above.

Q9. With place of performance listed as Fort Bragg, it suggests the vehicles may not leave the base and all manufacturing and installation work must be completed on the base. Is this correct?
A9. I do not remember anything saying the vehicles cannot leave the base.  The work will be completed at the contractors facility wherever that may be.

Q10. Are the contractor submited drawings reguired in any specific format other than printed hard copies ? Autocade, ProE, SmartCAM etc..?
A10.  We are not requiring any specific format.  That choice is being left up to the contractor.  As long as we can understand the technical drawings.
