<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) contemplates awarding a one year cost reimbursement contract with four option years.  This is a total small business set-aside procurement, the NAICS code is 541611, and is a request for proposals. CSAT is interested in highly experienced organizations able to handle a National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare which will implement a comprehensive program of information dissemination, knowledge application and technical assistance strategies to promote organizational and systems change at the national, state and local levels. The prime target audiences for this Center are Regional, State, and local child welfare and substance abuse agencies, including independent Tribal agencies and organizations.  As such the Center:

1)	Functions as the locus for the collection, dissemination and practical application, of the best available information on services and strategies for responding to the needs of families who come in contact with the child welfare system as a result of substance abuse;
2)	Helps communities identify gaps in services and develop integrated approaches to respond more effectively to families who come in contact with the child welfare system as a result of substance abuse;
3)	Convenes coalitions of policy makers, practitioners, researchers, consumers and
family members from substance abuse and child welfare to define new directions and strategies; and
4)	Provides targeted technical assistance through the use of national and local experts, who assist communities that wish to implement interventions such as problem/risk identification, cross-training strategies, staff co-location, and unique judicial/court strategies (such as family drug courts.)

This project is a re-compete to continue many of the activities that occurred under contract 270-02-7108 with the Center on Children and Family Futures entitled the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW), 2002-2007. The Statement of Work has been expanded to include additional tasks such as, the development of a training video and new tasks to support the requirement of the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-288) to fund and provide technical assistance to Regional Partnerships intended to increase the well-being of, and improve the permanency outcomes for, children affected by methamphetamine or other substance abuse. Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACF) is currently working on plans to implement this requirement of P.L. 109-288.

<DESC>The NIAID, NIH, and other DHHS agencies, support extramural research to develop new products to protect the public from the health consequences of biological agents that might be used in acts of bioterrorism and from emerging/re-emerging diseases, such as West Nile Virus, multi-drug resistant Tuberculosis, and Dengue Fever. The biological agents deemed to pose the greatest threat to civilian populations are prioritized in the NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens and toxins list, which is available at: http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm. 

The NIAID contributes to meeting the goals for host defense described in the NIAID Strategic Plan for Biodefense (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/Research/strat_plan.htm) by supporting the development of new candidate vaccine adjuvants that stimulate the innate immune response to: protect against pathogenic infection; specifically activate the appropriate arms of the immune response; and result in stronger, more protective vaccines against NIAID Category A, B, and C Priority Pathogens.  This novel class of adjuvants stimulates the innate immune response and demonstrates strong adjuvant properties in animal models. These candidate vaccine adjuvants will be developed for human use with currently licensed or new investigational vaccines, to protect against NIAID Category A, B, or C Priority Pathogens. This initiative supports the development of candidate vaccine adjuvants through immunological characterization studies, lead compound optimization, and/or Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies.

<DESC>This is a sole source acquisition to conduct research and technology studies to reduce volumes in High Level Waste (HLW) glass compositions for the Hanford Waste Treatment Plant (WTP).  The chromium leach factor is known to have a significant impact on estimated HLW glass volume created during the waste treatment process.  Oxidation practices have been limited to the use of a single oxidant, such as premanganate.  The proposed contract will provide application of proprietary technology for the application of multiple oxidants to expedite chromium oxidation and concurrently during alkaline leaching of aluminum with fewer required water washings of the waste prior to leaching, reducing operating cost and less mass of waste. Based on patent considerations, JEH Consulting Inc. supported by Tulane University is the only one reponsible source that will satisfy agency requirements. The Statutory authority permitting use of other than full and open competition is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(1)(i)(A) which allows other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency's requirements.

<RESPDATE>100207
<ARCHDATE>10312007
<CONTACT>Timothy Costas, 202-385-8570
<DESC>The Department of Transportation (DOT),  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Air Traffic Organization - EnRoute (ATO-E) plans to extend the current Second-Level Maintenance activities for the Display System Replacement (DSR)/User Request Evaluation Tool (URET) systems; Contractor Depot Logistics Support (CDLS) for DSR, URET, Initial Academy Training System (IATS), and Data Position (D-POS); and continue engineering and maintenance tasks associated with the EnRoute legacy automation systems, through September 30, 2009, under the AAS/DSR Contract DTFA01-88-C-00042 with Lockheed Martin Transportation and Security Solutions (LMTSS). The extension of CDLS and Second-Level Maintenance requirements are within the overall DSR contract period of performance and are mission critical to support the transition of the legacy EnRoute automation systems to EnRoute Automation Modernization (ERAM) systems.  There are numerous interdependencies between the DSR and ERAM systems and the short transition timeline to ERAM (2009) does not allow other than LMTSS to complete these activities without significant risk to current EnRoute Air Traffic operations and the transition to ERAM.   The existing DSR consoles and displays become part of the ERAM system baseline after ERAM transition.  ERAM replaces all software and backroom equipment at all twenty Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs).  As a result, the CDLS and software maintenance activities are intertwined with ERAM.  The ERAM program will rely on DSR CDLS activities to maintain DSR consoles and displays until ERAM transition is complete, and DSR software maintenance activities not only maintain the DSR software baseline, but qualify ERAM required software and firmware changes on DSR processors.  Specifically,  â€¢	LMTSS experience in developing and supporting DSR/URET will eliminate the time required to set up for (subcontracts, databases, facilities, personnel etc.) and become familiar with DSR/URET CDLS and second-level tasks thus avoiding the potential for logistics/software support disruption to DSR/URET and the interdependent schedule impacts to the fielding of the ERAM system by maintaining a single, integrated support provider until the ERAM transition is complete.   â€¢	LMTSS, as prime integrator, is uniquely positioned to understand, manage and provide continuous depot support for the multi-phased and numerous complexities and risks of transitioning EnRoute operational and support sites to ERAM including the continued support of the proprietary, aging and obsolete CDG cabinet until it is replaced by ERAM; and the replacement of hundreds of RISC 6000 processors; and repair capabilities for unique and no longer manufactured DSR LRUs. â€¢	LTMSS has acquired the expertise and subject matter experts (SMEs) for Second-level maintenance activities that include Software Maintenance Process, Software Maintenance Operating Procedures, Verification and Regression (V&R) Testing Process, Engineering Change Control Board (ECCB) Process, CAS Maintenance Process, Defect Prevention Process, and Critical Thread Review Process.  In accordance with FAA Acquisition Policy 3.2.2.4 and AMS Procurement Guidance T3.2.2.4.A.3, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the extension of DSR/URET sustainment activities, i.e. Second-level support and CDLS activities under Contract DTFA01-88-C-00042.  All inquires or questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to the Contracting Officer, Tim Costas, at email address Tim.Costas@FAA.Gov.

Basis for Award:

Offerors shall submit a list of current and past contracts (with points of contacts) dating back three years in which the Offerors performed similar work as to the requirement being listed by FEMA identifying whether the Offeror was a  Prime or Sub-Contractor.  FEMA will utilize the provided information to determine the Offerors? technical qualification to accomplish the required task.  The Offerors will be evaluated on:

(1)	Past Performance:  The Government will evaluate the Offeror?s, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors? and critical team members? demonstrated past performance in delivering quality products and services and in meeting technical, cost/price, and schedule requirements on similar programs; and to determine that the Offeror demonstrates the application of systemic improvement management practices and minimizing life cycle costs.  The Past Performance risk will address the probability of the Offeror successfully accomplishing the requested effort based on the relevant past performance.  Problems not addressed by the Offeror will be considered to still exist. However, consideration for discounting problems may be given when those problems are addressed through demonstrated systemic improvement.  The degree to which the Offeror can demonstrate that it has successfully applied continuous systemic improvement to resolve past performance problems will be evaluated.  Problems with no corresponding systemic improvement will be evaluated.  In the case of an Offeror without any relevant past performance of for whom the information on past performance is not available or is unknown, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably and will be assigned a rating of unknown.  

(2)	Technical Qualification: The Government will evaluate the extent and relevancy of the Offeror?s, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors? and critical team members? experience during the past three (3) years in performing the kind of work that will be required under the prospective contract and the Offeror?s ability to cope with the uncertainties and difficulties associated with that kind of work.  The Government will also evaluate the extent of relevant benefits (if any) that the Offeror gained from each contract/subcontract reference identified and how they relate to the task areas of the statement of work.  The risk will address the probability of the Offeror successfully accomplishing the requested effort based on the relevant experience.  

Award will be made on Best Value Basis to Government.  Quotes must be priced on F.O.B. Destination.  Interested organizations may submit their quotes via email to Kelly Lynch at Kelly.Lynch@dhs.gov, no later than 12 Noon Eastern Standard Time (EST), on September 24, 2007.

<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point requires rentals for conference rooms at the Holiday Inn Morgantown, PA for the period of 10/01/2007-09/30/2008. Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk Philadelphia intends to negotiate a sole-source purchase order with Holiday Inn for the rentals in the amount of $40,000.00. The Holiday Inn in Morgantown, PA is used by NAVICP Mechanicsburg and Philadelphia personnel for various meetings held throughout the year. The reasoning behind the sole source is that this particular hotel is centrally located between the two sites. Due to the remote location, the Holiday Inn is the only known source which has conference rooms large enough to accommodate the needs of both activities. In addition, they are the only known source in that area with the type of equipment (audio, visual, etc.) necessary for the meetings. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation will be awarded as a result of this announcement. However, interested persons may submit an offer which will be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. See note 22. Responses should be received no later than Thursday, September 20, 2007.

It will be essential to have the machine serviceable by factory reps in order to keep downtimes to an absolute minimum, thus reducing as many scheduling impacts as possible.	Jeffrey's Manufacturing Solutions is the regional distributor and the only Haas Automation rep within a 100 mile radius of MSFC. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Judith Drabkin at Judith.R.Drabkin@nasa.gov, FAX: 256-544-4401 no later than 4:30 p.m. local CST on September 25, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services'(CMS) mission is to ensure health care security to all beneficiaries.  In carrying out this mission, CMS is dedicated to the highest integrity of its programs and has contracted with various entities for benefit integrity functions.  Originally, program integrity efforts were aligned with CMS' fiscal intermediaries and carriers.  The recent enactment of section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) changes CMS' current contracting structure by phasing out the fiscal intermediaries and carriers and phasing in the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) for CMS Medicare claims processing.  As a result of the MMA and the adoption of the MAC strategy, a realignment of the program integrity jurisdictions is necessary so that workloads align with the new MACs. In addition, the future intent of these realignments is to have one program integrity contractor be responsible for the detection, deterrence and prevention of fraud, waste, and abuse across all claim types.
CMS has established seven (7) jurisdictional zones to deal efficiently with fraud, waste and abuse issues which also align effectively with multiple MAC jurisdictions.  CMS will be procuring the seven (7) zones in three (3) separate cycles.  

CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for three (3) zones as follows:
Zone 4:  Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico.
Zone 7:  Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Zone 5:  West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,    Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana.  

It is anticipated that three (3) separate stand alone single IDIQ contracts will be awarded for each zone with a base period plus 4 option years. CMS intends to solicit this requirement as a full and open competition. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of Request for Proposal in early October 2007.  The solicitation will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.   It is anticipated that this cycle will be awarded before May 31, 2008.  

CMS will hold a Pre-proposal Conference on October 17, 2007 at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Baltimore, MD.  More details will be provided with the release of the solicitation.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Saeedullah Khan Paracha, Managing Director, Habibullah Energy Ltd., 1st Floor, Nacon House, 270 Moulana Din Mohammad, Wafai Rd., Karachi, Pakistan, Phone: 92-21-568-5314, Fax: 92-21-568-4423, Email: hel@cyber.net.pk  
  Habibullah Integrated Coal Mining/Power Generation Feasibility Study. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study that would develop a plan for the reliable supply of coal of consistent quality and quantity to an appropriately located power plant, and would also help determine the appropriate plant configuration and technology.

The Grantee holds a Letter of Interest, issued through Pakistan's Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB), which required the Grantee to provide a sizeable bank guarantee that it will undertake and complete a power generation Feasibility Study based on coal from its two leases in the Lakhra coalfield by October 2008.  Habibullah Mines Limited (HML), a sister company of the Grantee, is concurrently looking to develop a plan to modernize its coal mining operations in anticipation of ramping up its coal supply for the power generation project.  The integrated Feasibility Study would include an evaluation of coal reserves available through the two leases and identify the period that the quantity can support the operations of a 150 MW electricity generation enterprise.  The Feasibility Study will also assist in developing and planning for appropriate mining operations suited to the quantity and quality of coal required, and to meet generally accepted international mine safety and health standards.  Additionally, the Feasibility Study will examine the necessary aspects for establishing a modern, environmentally-friendly coal-fueled electricity generation station, including site selection, selection of coal combustion technology, compliance with acceptable environmental emission standards, optimizing the station's heat rate, and the design of the facilities including arrangements, or alternatives, for cooling water.

The Feasibility Study will be used by the Grantee to negotiate the power purchase agreement (PPA), a parallel operating agreement (OA), and fuel supply arrangement (FSA) with appropriate parties, as well as the tariff structure with Pakistan's National Electric Power Regulatory Authority.  Following a successful Feasibility Study, PPIB would be in the position to issue a Letter of Support, which together with the approved PPA, OA and FSA, would provide the basis for the financial closure of the project and its construction and operation.  The Feasibility Study would also help determine which of three modern technologies (pulverized coal combustion, circulating fluidized bed combustion, and integrated gasification combined cycle) and which of two basic plant configurations (two 75 MW units or a single 150 MW unit) should be used.  Both of these decisions will be influenced by the quality of the coal that will be supplied for the plant, as well as environmental concerns and requirements.  The location of the plant, with critical factors being the plant's fresh water requirement, coal supply source selection, and proximity to the national power grid will also be a component of the Feasibility Study.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from an $810,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  The Grantee will contribute an additional $810,000 for a total of U.S. $1,620,000 dollars.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp</a></b>.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 3:00PM, LOCAL TIME November 1, 2007 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>1.     The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a single source firm fixed price purchase order to procure laboratory equipment; such as air track, photo gate timers, force tables, optic sets, collision cards and demonstration apparatuses from Pasco Scientific.  All of the equipment must interface with existing laboratory and demonstration equipment in the USAFA core physics classes.  Each of the items has a unique mechanical and electrical interface that must mate with existing hardware in the physics department.  Each item must work with and directly interface with the existing Pasco ME-9215B master timers, air tracks and force tables.  If a different contractor were selected, the full amount of this request would be spent purchasing entirely new systems and/or adding on new pieces to existing equipment.  Pasco Scientific is the only known source fully capable of the direct interface and functionality of slave timers and electromagnetic actuators for use with existing photo gate systems and software.

2.     The duplication of effort and cost that would be incurred by switching to new system is not considered of benefit to the government.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees. All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.      

3.        Any company that feels they can meet the requirements as stated above without impact to the current operation of the Department of Physics must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim no later than 24 September 2007.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

4.     This procurement is for the acquisition of a sole source commercial item using simplified procedures in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.  This office intends to award a contract by other than full and open competition in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.     5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	Zeiss LSM 510 NLO Multi-photon Confocal Microscope with Scanning Stage and  
         	Environmental Chamber


Purpose/Brief History:

The CCR Confocal Microscopy Core Facility was established by the NCI Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis in September 1997.  The core facility provides state-of-the-art confocal microscopy and digital imaging to CCR investigators to perform high quality clinical and translational research in cancer biology and to train students, residents, and fellows in the field of confocal microscopy.  The core facility also provides services and opportunities for collaborative research to investigators throughout the NCI as well as other NIH Institutes and FDA.  

The Zeiss LSM 510 NLO Multi-photon Confocal Microscope with Scanning Stage and  
Environmental Chamber will be used to perform imaging in thick specimens and will have three non-descanned, external detectors to provide multi-spectral imaging of these thick specimens.  A FLIM module will be added to this system for fluorescence lifetime imaging, an imaging technology that currently is not available to core facility users.  The XY scanning stage allows stitching of images to construct whole tissue sections as well as allow imaging at multiple locations during time lapse studies. 


PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

1.	Statutory Authority: Statute: 13.106-1 (b)

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.

(2)	For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

1.	Justification:

The CCR Confocal Microscopy Core Facility requries a third confocal and image processing system to meet the increased demand for extended time lapse imaging (overnight), to provide NDDs for deeper tissue imaging using the IR laser and to provide FLIM.  This system must provide high resolution; expanded fluorescence capability; speed and ease of use; and quality image capture, processing, and storage capabilities.  The Zeiss LSM 510 NLO Multi-photon Confocal Microscope with Scanning Stage and Environmental Chamber meets all of our specifications in one integrated system.  The Zeiss LSM 510 NLO system has a number of unique features not available from other companies.  These include Point Scanning 2P/Confocal, Internal detectors with Spectral Capability and 3 External Detectors for deep tissue imaging.  The LSM 510 NLO is a point scanning confocal with the following minimum specifications:  Laser Lines must Include IR Chameleon 680-1080nm tunable(>3W), 458,488,514,561,and 633 nm, at least 2KX2K image collection and must incorporate a separate pinhole for EACH internal detector on the system to accommodate different wavelengths so slice thickness between channels is balanced for colocalization when simultaneously scanning. It must support  1 and  2P simultaneous imaging with adjustable confocal pinholes and direct wide field detection of 2P signal.  It must be able to achieve speeds of at least >4Fps at full 512 X512 image acquisition.  It must incorporate Semrock filters with high efficiency sputter coated technology and optical correction for individual objective lenses via motorized collimator optics.  Users must be able to adjust for focusing of the IR beam to the visible beam. This allows for simultaneous excitation of VIS and IR excited fluors with perfect colocalization.  Any lens can be added and adapted by the user on the system.  It must have direct coupling for the Coherent Chameleon laser with computer controlled tuning with wavelength ranges between 680-1080nm, Acousto Optical Modulator(AOM) for attenuation and line selection and the AOM should require no prechirp for integration on the system as well as stable output of beam directly into the AOM.  No alignment by user should be required for the beam during wavelength tuning.  The system must run and be supported in femto second mode for optimal IR 2 photon imaging and must be able to output low power in the femto second range to insure optimal pulse width without heating at the specimen.  Automatic Z interpolation/correction during active scanning must be available to increase IR power, or detector sensitivity as user scans deeper into a highly scattering samples as well as automatic wavelength switching and image acquisition between two user specified IR wavelengths without user alignment of any kind between wavelengths.  

The Zeiss LSM 510 NLO Multi-photon Confocal Microscope with Scanning Stage and Environmental Chamber has unique features not available from other companies, is compatible with our existing equipment as all of our current equipment is Zeiss, and PC-based, we will be able to network this new system to other computers and printers in the laboratory, thus allowing for easy image transfer and/or printing.  We will be able to interchange parts, such as the PLAN APO objectives, if necessary.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	Coherent Chameleon System Ultra II Ti:Sapphire laser and Harmonic Generator 9300

Purpose/Brief History:

The Coherent Chameleon System Ultra II Ti:Sapphire laser and Harmonic Generator 9300 is required as the 2-photon laser for the Zeiss LSM 510 NLO Multi-photon Confocal Microscope with Scanning Stage and Environmental Chamber which will be used to perform imaging in thick specimens and will have three non-descanned, external detectors to provide multi-spectral imaging of these thick specimens.  The Harmonic generator is needed for the FLIM module which will be added to this system for fluorescence lifetime imaging, an imaging technology that currently is not available to core facility users.  As a core facility, we need to provide over 135 users with "state-of-the-art" multi-photon/confocal imaging for a wide range of applications, including time lapse, 3D, 4D, FRET, and FRAP.  

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

1.	Statutory Authority: Statute: 13.106-1 (b)

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.

(2)	For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

1.	Justification:

The CCR Confocal Microscopy Core Facility needs to purchase a multi-photon confocal with a Ti:Sapphire laser and Harmonic Generator to provide NDDs for deeper tissue imaging using the IR laser and to provide FLIM.   This solid state ultrafast laser system will be used as an excitation source in multiphoton microscopy and must be comprised of a solid-state single-frequency green pump laser, a sealed Titanium:Sapphire (Ti:S) Kerr lens modelocked oscillator, an actively controlled interface between these two components, a solid state chiller, and a dual manual and/or computer interface to allow for experimental integration.  The following performance specifications are required:  1)  Output average power specification required is > 3.3 Watt at peak of Ti:S curve, with a  tuning range of 680nm to 1080nm range.  Capabilities are required across this entire tuning range to cover our current and future experiments.  2) Capability for rapid wavelength changes, 40 nm/sec.  3) Repetition rate is nominal 80 MHz 4) Beam quality to specified as M2 < 1.1 to ensure tightest focusing capability. 5) Beam shape specified as better than (i.e. smaller range) ellipticity =  0.9-1.1.  A round beam ensures more efficient coupling of light from the laser into the microscope and minimal astigmatism. 6) Minimum tuning range required is 680nm - 1080nm inclusive without operator adjustments other than request of wavelength. System to tune through atmospheric absorption bands > 900 nm without requirement of external gas purge. 7) Pulse width approximately 140fSec. And 8) System shall have the lowest noise specifications to provide optimal images.  A noise spec of 0.5%, or less, is required.  Required design specifications are as follows:  1)  Optimized pulse width for maximum multi-photon excitation in a typical confocal microscope.  Pulse width must typically be between 120-140fSec across the full tuning range to minimize optical pulse stretching (also called "disperson" or "chirp") in our microscope and thus give minimum pulse width and highest peak power and highest multi-photon conversion efficiency at the sample.  In order to assure minimum chirping, output pulse must be very close to the bandwidth limit.  Systems with pulse width under 100fSec are unacceptable because they have too much bandwidth and thus exhibit large pulse chirping.  Typically these short-pulse systems attempt to use excess average power to make up for pulse stretching; however, excess average power will induce more photo-damage in our biological samples.  To further ensure minimum pulse chirp, pulse width must be actively controlled and optimized across full tuning range. 2)  Hermetically-sealed construction.  Diode pumped laser systems generally degrade due to optical contamination from dust and solvents present in the lab. It is required that the system be hermetically sealed to provide long life and minimal downtime. Our requirement for hermetic sealing is that there is no exchange of gas, or dust from the lab, as evidenced by no light leakage from the interior cavity.  3) Permanent alignment of head.  Our laboratory focus is on laser microscopy, as opposed to basic laser research. We require that the design of the laser be of permanent alignment, with no ports for dust invasion, and no field alignment requirements in order to meet our project deadlines. 4)  Design that minimizes downtime. The Ti:S oscillator cavity must be constructed with a single-tuning-element design to eliminate all needs for adjustment, optimization, or cleaning the system. System must include a closed-loop air filtration and recirculation unit to ensure that the cavity is free from out-gassing components, micro-dust particles, and water vapor.  System must be able to maintain less than 1% humidity at all times without external purging or other intervention.  5)  User-replaceable pump diodes.  Because pump diodes are the single greatest maintenance cost, diodes must be user replaceable and can be changed without the involvement of the laser head, or disturbance of any kind to the experimental set up. Disruptions of this kind, for example, to re-thread the optical fiber through the umbilical can be avoided.  6) Low noise.  Amplitude noise of the system is critical in many of small signal applications. Thus the Ti:S is pumped by a single-frequency/single-longitudinal mode pump source so that the noise spectrum will be free of chaotic noise behavior characteristic of multimode pump sources. 7) Integrated spectrometer.  System has an onboard spectrometer capable of monitoring both wavelength and bandwidth of Ti:S laser. Spectrometer to be addressable via USB. 8) Ultra-quiet Chiller.  System has a chiller that is all solid-state design.  Freon pump-type refrigeration units should not be acceptable as they are nosier and create greater waste heat and mechanical vibrations.  Furthermore, the chiller has the capability to be remoted up to 8 meters away for ultimate noise/heat suppression. And 9) System Control.  System should  be user controllable either via RS232 or via the panel interface located on the power supply.                        

Coherent Chameleon System Ultra II Ti:Sapphire laser and Harmonic Generator 9300 has unique features not available from other companies and is compatible with our existing equipment.

Portions of the existing system equipment are proprietary and only ADT can perform the upgrades.  ADT installed and has solely maintained the existing system and is best suited to make the modifications and changes to the equipment at the least cost to the government.  Due to the requirement to still utilize existing legacy equipment for dual access during SmartCard integration, any other action would result in complete failure of the security equipment and bring the entire access control system down.  This action will allow use of much of the existing systems base with specific upgrades to meet SPD-12, FPS 201 with compliant equipment that allows our legacy system to operate without system failure.  Additionally, this will facilitate the integration into the DHS Component Nationwide SmartCard management system which is forth coming from DHS.  The required open market products are considered commercial items in accordance with FAR Part 2 and are to be purchased utilizing simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Subpart 13.5 ? Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The above named vendor is believed to be the most advantageous source for providing upgrades to FEMA?s existing security alarm system equipment.  This notice of intent is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to provide the required products in writing via email or fax to Phyllis H. Woodward no later than 4:00 PM/EST, September 21, 2007.  Contact information is as follows:  Email to Phyllis.Woodward@dhs.gov or fax to 540-542-2631.  Capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>1.  The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) of the United States Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, is a technical assistance provider working on the development and implementation of laws and international agreements affecting trade and investment in over 35 countries worldwide including the Middle East and North Africa.  CLDP is supporting the U.S. Government?s Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) by providing technical assistance to a group of countries in the Middle East to improve their legislative and regulatory frameworks, and ultimately, to facilitate the region?s preparedness for the Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA).  

As trade and commerce increases in the Middle East and the countries in this region expand their presence in the global market, it is important that their business and legal professionals have an ever-greater familiarity with commercial law.  The objective of this particular technical assistance activity is to increase the capacity of law faculties in the region to cultivate future lawyers, judges, policy makers and business people who have an adept understanding of international commercial law practices and standards. As part of an ongoing program to this end, CLDP anticipates awarding a contract to one qualified expert to provide advice regarding the administration of commercial law curricula in law schools in the Middle East.  The expert will advise on the human resource and organizational requirements for the best administration of a commercial law curriculum.

2.   CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES 
Based on in-country consultations with the deans and administrators of the participating institutions, the Contractor will provide specifically tailored advice on all issues of commercial law curriculum administration.  Specifically, but not exclusively, the experts will provide information on appropriate faculty qualifications for the relevant courses, faculty sourcing, capacity building procedures for such faculty, as well as input on crafting course descriptions and syllabus formation.  The Contractor will provide the following services to accomplish this transfer of expertise:

2.1	Achieve, in cooperation with CLDP and the appropriate law faculties in the Middle East, an awareness of the latest state of development of the commercial law curricula in the institutions designated by CLDP.

2.2	Based on this understanding, and prior to initial consultations in country, draft a preliminary memo on projected areas of need for designated law faculties, challenges to achieving more successful administration, and other points of interest. 

2.3	Conduct meetings, in country, with appropriate law school deans and law professors of designated institutions in the Middle East in order to consult on areas of needed input and identify areas of future consultative support.

2.4	Submit progress reports for each trip to the region.

2.5	Participate in US based consultative visits for law school deans and professors from the designated institutions as they may arise in continuation of the technical assistance program.

3.  FORCE MAJEURE
In case of events beyond the control of the parties, CLDP and the Contractor will agree upon a new schedule and period of performance.


The duration of this contract is from October 1 through July 31, 2008 with three one year option periods.     The Government contemplates an award of a purchase order Requirements Contract, FAR 52.216-21, resulting from this RFQ.

<DESC>1.  BACKGROUND  The U.S. Department of Commerce?s Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) has been providing technical assistance to the Government of Tunisia as it strives to fight unemployment, especially the unemployment of young engineers. To that effect, CLDP has helped Tunisia foster the growth of technology-based Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), by building Tunisia?s expertise in the management of technology projects. In particular, CLDP has helped develop such capabilities at Institut des Hautes Etudes Commerciales (IHEC) and at Ecole Polytechnique, respectively Tunisia?s premier business school and engineering school.  

Under CLDP?s program, IHEC and Ecole Polytechnique reached a stage where creating a case study-based textbook on ?Entrepreneurship and Innovation in the Maghreb? (hereafter referred to as ?the Textbook?) was necessary in order to codify Tunisia?s newly developed management of technology expertise. IHEC has taken the lead in developing the Textbook and in drafting it in French.

The purpose of this Contract is to augment CLDP?s in-house expertise as it assists IHEC in finalizing the Textbook.  Specifically, under the Contract, the Contractor will provide expertise, comments and drafts on the content of the Textbook.

2.   CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES 
During the Contract period, the Contractor will assist CLDP in providing expertise in the areas of entrepreneurship and innovation in SME?s to IHEC as it finalizes the 150 to 200 page Textbook.  

In particular, the Contractor may be called upon by CLDP to do the following:

2.1  To review the drafts of chapters in the 150 to 200 page Textbook prepared by IHEC, and provide comments in order to finalize the text prior to publication.

2.2  To draft specific sections of the Textbook, in French, after review by CLDP.


3.  FORCE MAJEURE
In case of events beyond the control of the parties, CLDP and the Contractor will agree upon a new schedule and period of performance.


The duration of this contract is from date of award through September 15, 2008.     The Government contemplates an award of a Requirements Contract, FAR 52.216-21, resulting from this RFQ.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Furthermore, APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.<BR><BR>A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is soliciting contractual support to provide a wide range of technical and support services required for the proper care and use of laboratory animals for NIH animal programs.  The NIH is one of the world?s largest biomedical research organizations and is the focal point for US Government health research initiatives. It is comprised of 30 different categorical  Institutes and Centers (ICs) which conduct research in a variety of scientific disciplines including molecular biology, immunology and infectious disease, hematology and tissue transplantation, genetics, physiology, neurology, virology, bacteriology, pharmacology/toxicology, metabolism, biochemistry, cardiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and dentistry.  

Twenty-two ICs have laboratory animal programs providing research support for NIH intramural scientists.  NIH laboratory animal programs involve the use of approximately 575,000 square feet of space located primarily in twenty-six buildings on the Bethesda campus and thirteen buildings at the NIH Animal Center in Poolesville, MD.  Remote facilities include four leased facilities in Rockville and Gaithersburg and two Government owned facilities in Baltimore, MD.  All NIH animal programs and facilities comply with applicable laboratory animal regulations, guidelines and standards, and are accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC).  

The purpose of this acquisition is to provide a wide range of technical and support services required for the proper care, use and humane treatment of laboratory animals to any NIH IC animal program.  Functions include:  veterinary medicine, animal care and husbandry, veterinary and research technical support, data management, cage and environment sanitation, routine maintenance of animal care equipment, animal transportation, logistical and clerical support.  Support will be provided to projects involving a full range of biomedical research and scientific disciplines.  Continuous high quality animal care shall be provided as set forth in the applicable animal welfare regulations, standards and guidelines.  Animals must be maintained under carefully controlled conditions to minimize research variables and allow the accurate interpretation of laboratory results.  Consequently, it is essential that animal colonies be properly maintained to avoid any situation or condition that might unnecessarily adversely affect animal health and ongoing research.  The Contractor shall maintain strict adherence to all applicable Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

The procurement action is partially set-aside for small businesses.  Multiple, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, task order type contracts are anticipated.  The contracts are expected to be awarded for one sixty (60) month base period.  Individual task orders containing options are expected.   Tasks of low to moderate technical complexity with an IGCE of $250,000 or less will be set aside for small businesses. Tasks of low to moderate technical complexity with an IGCE of $100,000 or less will be set aside for 8(a) businesses.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICIS) code is 54171, Size Standard 500 Employees, Research and Development in the Physical Engineering, and Life Sciences.

Introduction<br/>
<br/>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  <br/>

<br/>The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has a requirement for establishing large scale, coordinated Systems Biology Programs that utilize a combination of computational and experimental methodologies to conduct research Projects to analyze, identify, quantify, model and predict the overall dynamics of the network of cellular molecular components of microbial organisms and their interactions with the host cells.<br/>
Description<br/> 

<br/>Each research Project of the Systems Biology Program shall concurrently utilize multiple high-throughput ?-omics? technologies to generate a diversity of experimental data. These experimental data shall be collected and integrated to develop and/or validate computational models of the molecular interaction networks involved in the biological processes under investigation.<br/>  

<br/>The resources generated by the System Biology Program shall be made publicly available and easily accessible to the scientific community through public data, software and reagent repositories and through web portals The ultimate goal of the Systems Biology Program is to enhance knowledge of the overall complexity of the biological, biochemical and biophysical molecular processes in microbial organisms and host cells which may lead to the initiation and progression of infectious diseases. Such information should identify novel, unique, as well as common molecular signatures that may represent future targets for intervention and could aid in the identification of emerging pathogens and in the development of antimicrobial drugs, immunotherapies, vaccines and diagnostics for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, thus potentially translating basic research findings into clinical applications.<br/>

<br/>It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about September 15, 2008. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows:  10.45 FTEs.<br/>

<DESC>THIS MARKET SURVEY IS REIVSED TO REFLECT THE CORRECT SIZE STANDARD FOR NAICS 541519.  THE SIZE STANDARD LISTED IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS $21M, HOWEVER THE CORRECT SIZE STANDARD IS $23M. This is a market survey for support services for the Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) Program.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with this submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense. This requirement was previously advertised in October 2006, however, we received a very limited number of acceptable/relevant responses from SEDB and SB.  At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  Since the first market survey was released, the SOW has been revised to show emphasis on the aviation safety aspect of the requirement and the job descriptions and qualifications have been more clearly defined.  Contractors interested in performing this requirement must clearly demonstrate competence to perform in both the aviation safety analysis discipline and the information technology discipline.  It is anticipated that the contract will be Time and Materials - Labor Hour Type contract with fixed hourly rates for each of the labor categories.  Travel and Materials will be cost-reimbursable.   The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors: 1. Capability Statement - This document should identify: â€¢        Type of services provided by your firm,  â€¢        Size and type of services provided on previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information, personnel qualifications and past performance to include contract numbers and length of contract)  â€¢        Number of years in business 2.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.   Attached is a draft of the Statement of Work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments.  All responses to this market survey must be received by 28 Sep 2007.

That is a span of almost 300 degrees, is this a typo?  Answer: No, this is not a typo, the temperature range is correct.  Question:  Will there be any gases or vapors (alcohol or other) present in the chamber during testing?  Answer:  We will be blowing approximately 2 liters of alcohol breath into a breath instrument within the chamber for each test, 20 tests x 2 liters of 0.080 grams ethanol per 210 liters of saturated breath.  Therefore, there will be ethanol vapor and water vapor introduced to the chamber in addition to breath by products.   The response date has been extended to September 24, 2007.

A: The data represents 926,124 calls that were accepted from August 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005. However, the number of actual calls records is slightly lower than this total number due to some information being lost in a server crash.

(17) Q: What percentage of the call note data is non-electronic (hand written)? How many boxes or other storage containers does that represent? 
A: Approximately 1/3 of the call note data is non-electronic. All of the available call information (paper and discs) fits into one lateral file drawer.

(18) Q: Where is the data physically located? If the data is not local, will the contractor be responsible for acquiring the data or will the contractor need to be onsite to access the data?
A: The data is physically located at the State of Texas. The details for accessing it will be finalized upon execution of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between DHS and the State of Texas, and will be provided to the contractor at that time.

(19) Q: What percentage of the call note data is electronic? Will the contractor need to be onsite to access this electronic data?
A: Approximately 2/3 of the data is electronic and is stored on CDs.  The details for access to the CDs will be provided upon execution of the MOU.
 
(20) Q: What percentage of the call data is derived from a CAD-style system (i.e. one that has call address, time, and other relevant attributes)? Will the contractor need to be onsite to access this data?
 A: We do not have this information at this time.

(21) Q: Is the note data (hand written or electronic) associated with a specific call with the call number identified?
A: No, the note data is not associated with a specific call with the call number identified.

(22) Q: Will the contractor have access to the call detail from each of the 26 Area Information Centers (AICs)?
A: Yes, for the available call records.  However, some call data from certain centers do not exist any more.  For example, the server at one of the centers crashed and they were unable to recover call data for this period. Accordingly, call detail is unavailable since the record was destroyed.

(23) Q: Does scope include other associated 211 operations (Child Healthcare, Integrated Eligibility and Enrollment)?
A: No, the scope does not include other associated 2-1-1 Call Center operations.

(24) Q: Do you anticipate this project to have linkage to various emergency operations (e.g., emergency operation centers, 911, etc.)?
A: No, this project will not have linkage to other emergency operations centers.

(25) Q: Will this process encompass planning for advanced citizen registrations for services (e.g., special services and needs)?
A: No, the process will not encompass planning for advanced citizen registrations for services.

(26) Q: Is change management for call processing anticipated as part of the project?
A: No, the scope of this project will not include change management for call processing.

(27) Q: Are there any current geospatial indicators captured in the 211 data available (e.g., telephone number, ZIP code, etc.)?
A: Yes, the geographic information associated with the data is predominantly zip codes.

(28) Q: Are there any current geospatial tools in place for the 211 operations (e.g., ESRI)?
A: We do not have that information at this time.

(29) Q: What current databases are in use for the AICs?
A: Data gathering tools included Info &Referral (I&R) applications such as Alliance, Iris, Beacon, Tapestry, and ServicePoint. Hand-written data gathering occurred during this time period as well.

(30) Q: What data gathering tools (I&R or CRM applications) are currently in use today and were in use during the August 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005 period?
A: The data gathering tools in use during August 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005 include I&R Software: Alliance, Iris, Beacon, Tapestry, and ServicePoint. Hand-written data gathering occurred during this time period as well. However, knowledge of the current data gathering tools is not a requirement of the Government for performance under this RFQ.

(31) Q: Is there a preferred database for the end state plan?
A: The preferred database for the end state plan (assuming this refers to the database that will contain the content from the calls and be delivered to DHS) is one that supports statistical analyses of the data stored in the database (e.g. SPSS). 

(32) Q: What is the estimated volume of ?hand written notes stored in boxes? that will need to be read and have data entry performed?
A: All of the information (paper and discs) fits into one lateral file drawer.

(33) Q: What assistance and resources will be provided by the Texas 211 AICs in gathering the data?
A: There is someone who can answer questions about the data, which is already all in one place. The amount of assistance available will depend on the MOU between DHS and 2-1-1, which has not been finalized yet.

(34) Q: Will the existing databases and boxes of notes be centrally accessible (specifically in Washington DC) or will the vendors? project team be required to visit each of the 26 AICs to gather the necessary data?
A: The data is currently centrally accessible in Austin, TX. Other arrangements that might be made according to the MOU have not been finalized yet.

(35) Q: Would DHS accept a response that has a ?spotlight? clause to analyze the data and adjust the project accordingly (e.g., 4-6 weeks after initial analysis)?
A: This solicitation amendment changes the contract type from fixed price to time and materials which will account for the uncertainty in the requirement.

(36) Q: Can the government provide a list of the types of electronic formats? Can samples be provided? Do you have data dictionaries for the electronic formats and can they be provided?
A: The government cannot provide a list of the types of electronic formats, and samples cannot be provided.  There are no data dictionaries for the electronic formats in existence.

(37) Q: Can the government provide an estimate of the total number of electronic records created during the calendar period specified in the Statement of Work (SOW)?
A: 926,124 calls were accepted from August 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005.  However, the number of actual calls records is lower than that due to some information being lost in a server crash.  Approximately 2/3 of the data is electronic and is stored on CDs at this time.

(38) Q: Can the government provide an estimate of the total number of paper records created during the calendar period specified in the Statement of Work (SOW)?
A: Approximately 1/3 of the records are paper records since approximately 2/3 of the data is electronic.

(39) Q: Are the paper and/or electronic call records captured in more than one language? If so, which?
A: The paper and/or electronic call records are captured in one language, which is English.

(40) Q: Is the selected vendor responsible for conversion of any paper records into electronic data? 
A: The relevant information from the paper records must be entered into the electronic database in which the information from the project will be stored and transferred to DHS. However, the paper records do not need to be transcribed into electronic format beyond the entry of relevant information into the database.

(41) Q: For paper and electronic call records what address and/or geospatial information is already available?
A: The full extent of the existing address and/or geospatial information is unknown, as this information varies by individual call records.  However, the predominant geographic information available is zip codes.

(42) Q: Does the government have a ?minimum geographic unit? in mind in overlaying demographic data on the geospatial data? For example, is it a block, a census tract, or a county, etc.? 
A: The government does not have a ?minimum geographic unit? in mind in overlaying demographic data on the geospatial data. This will be an aspect of the Offeror?s response that will be considered in the technical evaluation.

(43) Q: Would the government be amenable to geospatial coordinate gathering occurring in the base year but the analysis and related cartography would occur in the option year? 
A: Offerors shall provide quotes in accordance with the requirements as defined in the solicitation.

(44) Q: Does the government have any preference for type of electronic format used to deliver the published project data? 
A: The preferred database for the end state plan (assuming this refers to the database that will contain the content from the calls and be delivered to DHS) is one that supports statistical analyses of the data stored in the database (e.g. SPSS).

(45) Q: Does government expect or need to have access to interim data sets?
A: No, the government does not expect or need to have access to interim data sets.

(46) Q: If the raw call center data is in more than one language, does the final delivered project data set need to support multiple languages?
A: The raw call data center is only in English, and the final delivered data set will not need to support multiple languages.

(47) Q: Does DHS S&T have dedicated funding for the Texas 2-1-1 temporal and geospatial analysis project? Does DHS S&T have dedicated funding for the subsequent analyses throughout the U.S. and related software build out of the data collection template?  
A: See Question 11.

(48) Q: Is there an incumbent providing these services and if there is what is their name and contract number under which they are performing the work?  If this is not a direct re-compete with an incumbent is there a company performing any of the required tasks in whole or in part? If so what is their name and contract numbers?
A: This project constitutes a new requirement.  There is no incumbent contractor involved in the effort.

(49) Q: Does DHS S&T have a desired or target start date?
A: The target start date is as soon as contract award can be made.

(50) Q: Is there an incumbent currently providing similar analytical services as described in the Statement of Work or is this a new requirement?  If there is an incumbent, can DHS please provide the name of the incumbent firm?
A: See Question 48.

(51) Q: Does DHS anticipate any work being performed Government-site?  Does DHS anticipate the database, and any associated hardware, being maintained Government-site?
A: DHS does not anticipate any work being performed Government-site aside from meetings with the Human Factors Program Office.  DHS will own the database, but it will not need to be updated maintained for new call data. 

(52) Q: Will the database that the selected contractor develops need to interface with other DHS databases or systems or will it be a standalone database?
A: The database will be an independent, stand-alone database and will not be required to interface with other DHS databases or systems.  The primary purpose of the database is to serve as a standardized data collection repository for the relevant call data to support analyses of what needs were identified by callers, over what time period and at which geospatial coordinates, and will not be updated for new calls 

(53) Q: Does DHS have a rough order of magnitude for the number of 211 calls received by the 26 regional Texas 211 Information and Referral System call centers from 1 August 2005 through 31 December 2005 (e.g., tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions)?
A: See question 16.

(54) Q: Does DHS have an estimate (whether an absolute number or a percentage) of the number of calls that have handwritten versus electronic notes?
A: See Question 13.

(55) Q: Did any of the Texas 211 centers use a database and data entry tool to collect data?  Were the paper and electronic call notes made on forms or were they freehand? 
A: See Question 30.

(56) Q: Are there audio recordings of the calls that the contractor will be expected to analyze? 
A: No, there are no audio recordings of the calls that the contractor will be expected to analyze and this is not a requirement by the government.

(57) Q: How exact is the information about the geographic origin of each call (e.g., general city, specific zip code, or exact street address)?
A: Where available, most of the geographic information on the origin of each call is by zip code.

(58) Q: Where does the Texas 211 call center data currently reside (i.e., in one central call center, distributed among the 26 regional call centers, or at DHS facilities)? 
A: The data is currently centrally accessible in Austin, TX. Other arrangements that might be made according to the MOU have not been finalized yet.

(59) Q: Is the call center data ready for delivery (i.e., not mixed in with unrelated paper or electronic information)?  If not, will the selected contractor have the responsibility of helping to prepare and separate the call center data for use in the database and subsequent analyses?
A: It is all together in one lateral file drawer with no other data mixed in.

(60) Q: Under what authority will the selected contractor collect information from the regional 211 centers?   In other words, will the selected contractor have to negotiate access to call center information with DHS, the State of Texas, or whoever holds the call center data? 
A: See Question 18.

(61) Q: The Price Worksheet (Attachment 3) references a 42-month period of performance but the Statement of Work references three one-year periods of performance (36 months total).  Can DHS please clarify the expected periods of performance?  
A: See Question 8.

(62) Q: In the Synopsis, the Quote Format section notes that the page limit shall be 10 one-sided pages inclusive of the cover page.  The Quote Format section also requires that the technical quote include a table of contents.  Can DHS confirm that both the cover page and table of contents count against the 10-page quote limit?  
A: The cover page and table of contents count against the 10 page quote limit. 

(63) Q: Does DHS wish to see resumes of proposed personnel for this effort?  If so, will the inclusion of resumes count against the 10-page limit? 
A: See Question 6.

(64) Q: Given the short turnaround time between submittal of questions and the proposal due date, will DHS consider extending the due date beyond 17 September 2007? 
A: The due date has been extended to September 25, 2007 at 12:00 PM EST.

All other terms and conditions of the subject Request for Quotations remain unchanged.

<RESPDATE>092807

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF BIZ OPS ANNOUNCEMENT This announcement is an update to the 29 Aug 2007 Federal Biz Ops posting for NATO Trainer Cargo Aircraft Alternatives study for the purpose of clarifying the intent and requirement for sources sought. The requirement is to develop a source list of companies interested in providing information, ideas and solutions to fulfill the functions of passenger airlift, cargo airlift and pilot training provided by the three (3) NATO owned and operated Trainer Cargo Airlift (TCA) aircraft (B707) stationed at the NATO Air Base, located at Geilenkirchen, Germany.  Companies will be provided a Request For Information (RFI) to enable NATO perform their study/analysis of alternatives. The TCA aircraft provide valuable airlift (cargo and personnel) support of NAEW&C Force Command (FC) E-3A aircraft operations.  The TCAs are also used for pilot basic qualification and continuation training.  Due to their age, flying hours and accumulated cycles, it has become increasingly difficult to sustain and maintain these aircraft in a cost effective manner.  Based on the requirements articulated by NATO, airlift support for NE-3A operations may be required until the year 2035 and possibly beyond. NATO has developed an initial list of potential alternatives for fulfillment of the TCA requirements.  Potential options include replacement of existing aircraft, leasing of aircraft and/or procurement of air transport services to support the military requirements.  Options also include pilot training, organic and or contracted services. NATO requires information to determine the viability of the options and to facilitate the eventual generation of a NATO conducted study/analysis. Accordingly, NATO would like to enlist and solicit industry support in obtaining this information.  The current annual TCA flight requirements are provided as follows: Radius: .	1,000 to 4,000 km, 90 flights .	4,000 to 6,000 km, 80 flights .	10,000 to 15,000 km, 10 flights Cargo & Pax: .	100 kg to 1 pallet + 5 to 20 pax, 60 flights .	3,000 - 7,500 kg, 3 to 5 pallets + 40 to 60 pax, 60 flights .	7,000 - 15,000 kg, 7 to 10 pallets + 60 to 80 pax, 50 flights .	700 x 300 x 175 cm, 5,000 kg, oversized cargo, 10 flights  Passengers:   .	30 to 50 groups pax, 12 flights of 6,000 km Pilot Training: .	Multi-engine, crew coordination, initial qualification .	Pilot proficiency In summary, the intent of this announcement is to solicit the interest of qualified companies who are in interested in this potential solicitation.  Accordingly, interested companies are requested to response to the Contracting Officer, with a one-page "white paper" with an understanding of this document and provide contact details, i.e., POC and alternate, e-mail addresses, full postal address, post code, telephone and fax numbers for your company and or for each nominated company. Request responses NLT 28 SEPTEMBER 2007  See Note 26.

<DESC>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy intends to award a purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to Coherent Laser, Inc. for an 18 Watt CW SLM pump laser, model Verdi V18, regenerative laser amplifier Ti: Sapphire, and second harmonic generator for REGA output.  This item service is being acquired for academic and research applications at the US Air Force Academy Physics Laboratory.  The required laser system must deliver output at 852nm and 426 nm at repetition rate > 250 kHz and with typical pulses of width under 1pSec at 852nm.  The laser must deliver non-mode-hop, single longitudinal-mode output; i.e., line width must be under 5MHz.  Systems based on multi-axial design (MAD or QMAD) are not acceptable because of the mode-beating noise inherent in this design.  The laser must have a noise performance of lower than 0.03% rms from 10Hz to 1GHz.  When replacing pump laser diode modules the laser head position and beam propagation path must not change, nor shall the laser cavity require any realignment or exposure to the laboratory environment.  The pump diode module and the delivery fiber must detach from each other.  The delivery fiber must be single core and not detach at the laser head when replacing the laser pump diode module.  The laser system must automatically and continuously optimize the pump diode wavelength in order to maximize optical conversion efficiency and to ensure maximum pump diode lifetime. Systems that use an assumed pre-programmed decay rate are unacceptable.  The laser system must be compatible with, and will be seeded with the Academy's existing Verdi-V10 and MIRA 900 Laser system.  Coherent has been found to be the only vendor who manufactures a complete laser system that meets the Academy's experiment requirements and is also equipped with a service and repair group capable of making all repairs on-site and in a timely manner.  Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.  No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  If no response is received by 20 Sep 2007  12:00PM, MDT, to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies and or services though a sole source procurement with Coherent Laser, Inc., a sole source award will be made

AIRBORNE LASER (ABL) HIGH ENERGY LASER WAVE-FRONT SENSOR (HELWFS) TECHNOLOGY

THIS DOCUMENT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  DO NOT PREPARE OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  THE PURPOSE OF THE RFI IS TO CONDUCT MARKET RESEARCH AND RECEIVE INPUT FROM INDUSTRY ON THE FOLLOWING TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED BELOW.  THE GOVERNMENT MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE THE REQUIREMENT IN THE FUTURE.  INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE SHARED WITH CONTRACTORS SUPPORTING THE ABL PROGRAM AND WITH FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS.  TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO LT. MIKE PRIMROSE AS STATED IN THE CONTACT SECTION BELOW.  SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ARE LISTED AT THE END OF THE DOCUMENT.  

CONTACTS
Questions, comments, or suggestions should be directed to Lt Mike Primrose, MDA/ABL/ALTC, at (505) 853-3772 or michael.primrose@kirtland.af.mil.  


DESCRIPTION

A.	INTRODUCTION:
The Department Of Defense (DoD) is interested in receiving information for market research purposes for high frame rate, low noise, large format cameras for applications such as active tracking, wave-front sensing, imaging, and laser scoring.  In the event an HELWFS will be pursued, the Government is interested in understanding what market capabilities exist to satisfy the requirement.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC), Lt. Mike Primrose is encouraged.

B.	TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA:

The DoD is interested in approaches that address the following camera output performance goals:
1)  Wavelength: The camera shall detect near-infrared photons in the 1.315 micron region.  High quantum efficiency (>0.65) is desirable to maximize the camera performance.
2)  Frame Rate: The camera system shall have a frame rate of at least of 5.5 kHz, as required for airborne and surface-based applications.  Readout latencies should be compatible with the rates noted here and in subsequent items. Readout times shall be less than 50usec and integration times shall be user-selectable from 0.5usec to 20usec.
3)  Noise: The overall camera noise performance shall be less than 20 electrons per pixel NEI.  This camera is primarily intended to see High Energy Laser (HEL) light for wave-front sensing applications, so very low noise is not critical. However, commonality with existing cameras and good performance suggests to us that Avalanche Photo-Diode (APD) technology is of special interest, with avalanche gains needed in the region 1-100 or more.  The noise values quoted here represent all additive noise sources, including dark current and readout noise.  Multiplicative noise sources (such as uncompensatable temporal or spatial variations in per-pixel gain) shall be less than 3%.
4)  Array Format: The camera shall be produced in an array format for tracking, wave-front sensing, imaging, and scoring applications, with designs supporting array sizes of at least 128x128 being desired.  Pixel pitch shall be 30um, pixel response non-uniformities shall be correctable to 5% with linear gain-offset Non-Uniformity Correction (NUC) algorithms.
5)  Multiplexer: An electronic multiplexer to rapidly read out the full array or subsets of the array is desirable.  The number of ports should be compatible with the desired frame rate and available bandwidth for the overall camera system.
6)  Dynamic Range: The dynamic range of the pixel output shall be greater than 2000:1, with at least 12 bits of quantization in the camera's digitizers.
7)  Cross Talk:  Nearest-neighbor pixel cross talk shall be less than 5% from all sources.
8)  Read Out Time:  The pixel read out time shall be < 50usec, and the integration time shall be user-selectable from 0.5 usec to 20usec.
9)  Triggering:  The camera shall be capable of initiating its exposure from an external electrical signal (using a standard high-speed protocol such as low-voltage differential signaling).  The timing jitter, from the input trigger edge to the beginning of the exposure, shall be less than 100 nsec.  In this external triggering mode, the camera's frame rate shall be controlled by the frequency of the external signal, i.e., from 0 Hz to 5.5 kHz.  The camera shall ignore any trigger signal that comes sooner than the camera's minimum frame time after an earlier valid trigger.
10)  Operations: The camera shall be capable of high temperature >200 K  (-99 degrees F) operation.  The camera shall achieve operating temperatures when provided forced air between 275 K and 280 K (35 - 45 degrees F) with a flow rate of 1.5 lbs/min/camera using normal room air.  The camera's internal cooling system shall not introduce mechanical vibrations.
11)  Pixel Fill: The pixel fill factor shall be greater than 80%, meaning that at least 80% of the Focal Plane Array (FPA) area is to respond to light.  This requirement recognizes that certain technologies, such as Avalanche Photo-Diodes (APD), may not be able to produce the desired 100% fill factor.  But detectors that can match the other requirements while achieving 100% fill factor will be considered a plus.
12)  Lifetime: The camera shall be capable of usage lifetime characterized by Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF)=5 years, as the expected uses are for operational DoD systems.  Since these systems can be remote, long lifetime and shelf life are essential to this effort.
13)  Persistence:  Focal plane persistence is defined as the fraction of the camera's response to illumination in one frame, that persists as an apparent response in the next frame. Persistence shall be less than 1E-5 for any pixel.
14)  Extinction Ratio:  The Overall Extinction Ratio (defined as the ratio of the video signal with the tube/APD etc. gated off to the video signal with tube/APD gated on when operated in accordance with the specified timing) for wavelengths near 1.315 microns shall be < 1E-5.

The Government asks that industry respondents discuss how camera performance could be measured, using standard metrics such as responsivity, detectivity, noise equivalent power (or irradiance), or D-star.  The Government also requests that respondents define and discuss how measurements could be made to prove performance on items 1-14 above.

QUESTIONS

DESCRIPTION

A.	INTRODUCTION:
The Department Of Defense (DoD) is interested in receiving information for market research purposes for high frame rate, high bandwidth, low noise detectors for applications such as active tracking, wave-front sensing, imaging, and laser scoring.  In the event that the ADT will be pursued, the Government is interested in understanding what market capabilities exist to satisfy the requirement.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC), Lt. Mike Primrose is encouraged.  

B.	TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA:
 
The DoD is interested in approaches that address the following camera output performance goals:
1)  Wavelength: The camera shall detect near-infrared photons in the region 1.0-1.1 microns.  High quantum efficiency (>0.65) is desirable to maximize the camera performance.
2)  Frame Rate: The camera system shall have a frame rate of at least 5.5 kHz, as required for airborne and surface-based applications.  Readout latencies shall be less than 50 microseconds, and compatible with the rates noted here and in subsequent items.
3)  Noise: The overall camera noise performance shall be less than 10 photons per pixel NEI.  However, DoD is interested in being able to scale the designs to the desirable 1-photon NEI performance level. Avalanche Photo-Diode (APD) technology is of special interest in this regard, with gains needed in the region 10-100 or more.  The noise values quoted here represent all additive noise sources, including dark current readout noise  Multiplicative noise sources (such as uncompensatable temporal or spatial variations in per-pixel gain) shall be less than 3%.
4)  Array Format: The camera shall be produced in an array format for tracking, wave-front sensing, imaging, and scoring applications, with 128x128 pixels whose size is 30microns in order to be consistent with current ABL optics.  The pixel fill factor shall be greater than or equal to 0.9.  Pixel non-uniformities shall be correctable to 5% with linear gain-offset Non-Uniformity Correction (NUC) algorithms.  The array will be designed so that a Multi Lenslet Array can be interfaced to the camera with minimal effort or off-board alignment requirements.
5)  Multiplexer: For large arrays, an electronic multiplexer to rapidly read out the full array or subsets of the array is desirable.  Of particular interest is a device for which multiple non-overlapping regions of interest (ROI's) may be simultaneously read out.  The number of I/O ports should be compatible with the desired frame rate for the overall camera system, as well as the ROI read capability for the detector array.
6) Dynamic Range:  The dynamic range of the pixel output shall be greater than 2000:1, with at least 12 bits of quantization in the camera's digitizers.
7) Cross Talk:  Nearest-neighbor pixel cross talk shall be less than 5% from all sources
8) Read Out Time: The pixel read out time shall be < 50usec, and the integration time shall be user-selectable from 0.5 usec to 20usec.
9) Triggering:  The camera shall be capable of initiating its exposure from an external electrical signal (using a standard high-speed protocol such as low-voltage differential signaling).  The timing jitter, from the input trigger edge to the beginning of the exposure, shall be less than 100 nsec.  In this external triggering mode, the camera's frame rate shall be controlled by the frequency of the external signal, i.e., from 0 Hz to 5.5 kHz.  The camera shall ignore any trigger signal that comes sooner than the camera's minimum frame time after an earlier valid trigger.
10)  Operations:
-	ABL platform provides for two separate mounting packages/units. The sensor head platform is 6.25"H x 6"L x 4"W excluding protrusions from electrical connectors and kinematic mount features.
-	The support electronics package has a 6"L x 6"H x 4"W platform available.
-	Max weight  - TBD.
-	Mounting and fastening - Plug and Play.
-	Cameras shall achieve their nominal operating performance while provided with forced air between 35 degrees F and 45 degrees F, with a flow rate of 1.5 lbs/min/camera using normal room air.  The camera's internal cooling system shall not introduce mechanical vibrations.
11) Electrical:
-	Electrical Power Supplied - 28 VDC Type I and  II
-	(For All Operational Modes) - 208 VAC, 3 phase, 400 Hz
-	All other Mil-STD to be called out later (environmental)
-	Electro Optical cleanliness per Mil - STD 1246C, Level 200
-	Frame Start Synchronization (user provided)
       -	Signaling protocol:  LVDS, 100 nsec minimum pulse width
       -	Sample rate: DC to 5.5 kHz
       -	Jitter between Frame Start Synchronization pulse and beginning of exposure:  100 nsec maximum
-	Video Signal Interface:  eight LVDS 28-bit data links using the National Semiconductor Channel Link signaling protocol.  Each link will carry two 12-bit camera channels.  Three additional bits will be added by the FPGA in the camera to identify valid line and field periods, and the "CCD Active" interval. One additional bit will be held in reserve.  The resulting 28-bit word will be transmitted over a link consisting of 4 LVDS pairs at a bit rate of 252 Mbit/s each, with a fifth LVDS pair carrying a 36 Mhz clock.
12) Lifetime: The camera shall be capable of lifetime consistent with Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF)=5 years, as the expected uses are for operational DoD systems.
13) Persistence:  Focal plane persistence is defined as the fraction of the camera's response to illumination in one frame, that persists as an apparent response in the next frame. Persistence shall be less than 1E-5 for any pixel. 
14) Extinction Ratio: The Overall Extinction Ratio (defined as the ratio of the video signal with the tube/APD etc. gated off to the video signal with tube/APD gated on when operated in accordance with the specified timing) for wavelengths near 1.0 - 1.1 microns shall be < 1E-5.

The Government asks that industry respondents discuss how camera performance could be measured, using standard metrics such as spectral responsively, detectivity (D*), and noise equivalent signal power (or irradiance).  The Government also requests respondents discuss how measurements could be made to prove performance on items 1-14 above.

QUESTIONS
Following are some specific questions regarding the ADT requirements.  Contractors should freely make any other comments or suggestions on areas not discussed here.

1)  Does industry believe that the draft Advanced Detector Technology (ADT) specifications are reasonable?  If not, please provide recommendations on how the draft specifications could be improved.
2)  Is there anything in the current description that is unnecessary? 
3)  What is an adequate schedule for development of an ADT?
4)  What is a reasonable cost estimate to develop an ADT?
5)  In addition to responding to any of the above questions, industry may also offer any other comments or recommendations that it feels would improve the technical effort.

<ARCHDATE>11172007
<CONTACT>Wayne Berry Contract Officer  440-526-3030 x7438
<DESC>Anyone wishing to respond to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence they can meet these requirements. Interested parties have until September 21, 2007 to submit their qualifications and capabilities in writing. Such qualification and capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Fax responses to the attention of Wayne Berry at (440) 838-6052 or email at Wayne.Berry@VA.GOV. Oral communication will not be accepted. If there are no further responses to this notice within the time designated, negotiation will commence with Vicon Motion Systems.   EQUIPMENT REQUEST:  VICON MX MOTION CAPTURE SYSTEM  1. Nature of equipment.  We propose to purchase a motion capture system that will modernize and advance  our shared central core facility, the Motion Study Laboratory of the Cleveland Functional  Electrical Stimulation (FES) Center located in the Louis Stokes Cleveland Department  of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. A state-of-the-art digital motion capture system  will insure uninterrupted data collection, facilitate computationally intense data  processing and provide for a greater number of collaborative projects within the rich and  extensive local research community that concentrates on musculoskeletal health and  motor control. This new equipment will achieve our long-term objectives of developing  sophisticated musculoskeletal controllers for surface and implanted FES systems and  adding real-time biofeedback capabilities to extend our current protocols to address the  priorities of returning veterans from OIF/OEF, especially as they relate to new projects  involving advanced limb prosthetics and orthotic systems.  The instrument that we are requesting is a motion capture system that records and  analyzes 3-dimensional (3-D) movements and the forces associated with those  movements. This system, the VICON MX, records human movement by tracking  reflective markers attached to skeletal landmarks of study participants. An array of  specialized video cameras captures this movement as participants move through a  calibrated volume while the system digitally reconstructs the motion in 3-D.  The system's data collection and analysis software consists of programs to control  data capture and upload 3D photogrammetric calibration, fully automated 3D marker  reconstruction, and specialized biomechanical models of the human body to display and  calculate results. Results from an analysis of lower extremity mechanics include  kinematic data such as center of mass motion, and hip, knee, and ankle joint angles  during walking, and kinetic data such as joint forces, moments and powers. In addition,  spatiotemporal data can be calculated such as gait velocity, step and stride times,  stance and swing times, and single and double support times. Furthermore, the  recorded movements can be mapped to a project-specific 3D model of a human, e.g.  adapted to specific applications such as reaching or grasping.  The requested motion capture system, the VICON MX, will be a new digitally based  imaging system that will replace our current motion capture system, the VICON 370E.  Critical improvements with the new system will be increased accuracy, efficiency, real  time operation and flexibility of motion capture research. Our current system is 15 years  old, its analog components are failing, and the system is lacking key advantages  available in modern systems such as real-time output for biofeedback, virtual reality or  close-loop control applications.   The instrument is a VICON MX 16 camera motion capture system.  Includes 16 VICON MX13 Cameras with 1.3 MegaPixel resolution, VICON  Workstation Software (Site License), VICON MX Biomechanics Accessory Kit, 1  year of &quot;Complete&quot; Service Level Support Agreement, VICON On-Site  Installation and Training.  VICON Polygon 3.0 Full Version  Muscle modeling and report generation module  VICON PECS Control  ActiveX interface for other programs  MXControl component  Enhanced data collection with 3rd party capture devices such as force plates,  EMG etc., permits selection of active channels, date rates, gains  4. Personnel qualified to operate equipment/interpret experimental results.  All of the Investigators listed above are qualified to interpret the experimental results  obtained with the equipment. Half (6) of the investigators listed above have operated  similar systems and can easily come up to speed with the new equipment. In addition,  the following personnel are also qualified to operate the equipment:  Set-up of the system will be accomplished by the vendor and is included in the price  of the instrument. Dr. Ronald Triolo (Director of the Motion Study Laboratory at the  Cleveland FES Center, Dr. Elizabeth Hardin, and Mr. Rudi Kobetic (Technical Director  of the Motion Study Laboratory) will actively guide the vendor through the installation  process and integrate it into the existing instrumentation in the Motion Study Laboratory.  Their experiences in motion capture tasks include setup, collection of motion data, and  managing of all equipment, maintenance of paper documents (e.g. informed consent,  data collection protocol and anthropometric measurement forms) and redundant  backups of electronic data, transfer of data to collaborators, training and supervision of  students or other staff to assist with data reduction, creation of gait reports, creation and  continued updating of outcome parameters within a gait database and summary of data  for presentations, grant submissions, and papers. They have worked with similar data  capture systems in studies involving various populations including trans-tibial and transfemoral  amputees, and paralysis secondary to SCI, stroke or multiple sclerosis.

<SUBJECT>A -- GOES-R Ground Segment: Market Research and Release of Draft Documents for Anticipated Procurement
<DESC>This requirement is in the market research phase and the Government is not only seeking sources for this proposed acquisition but alternatives to the approach reflected in the referenced documents.

A.  Background

On March 21, 2007 NOAA posted a pre-solicitation notice (reference number: NE-EK000-5-00033) that identified a revised GOES-R acquisition approach for the procurement of space and ground systems for the GOES-R satellite.  This notice explained how NOAA awarded contracts for the Preliminary Design and Risk Reduction (PDRR) phase of GOES-R to three contractor teams in anticipation of a single contract for the spacecraft, ground system, and system integration.  However, the Government has determined that the spacecraft and ground system will be procured separately.  The PDRR contracts ended April 20, 2007, and NOAA and NASA are now proceeding with their separate procurements.  NOAA will retain overall program management responsibility, acquire the ground system, operate the system following satellite launch, and will be responsible for algorithm development.  NASA will award the spacecraft contract, continue to award the instrument contracts, and acquire the launch vehicle under a separate contract.  The GOES-R Program office will manage overall systems engineering and integration.

B.	Pre-solicitation Information for Potential Offerors:

1.  This is a solicitation for Government market research and offeror planning purposes.  The objective during this phase is to invite potential prime offerors/offeror teams to submit information and request a one-on-one discussion that allows the Government to assess the market for viable competitors.  The Government is seeking sources for the proposed acquisition, and is soliciting top level feedback and alternatives to the procurement approach reflected in the GOES-R Ground Segment related documents.  NOAA is conducting this activity to promote competition, improve the Governments knowledge of industrys capabilities, and improve potential offerors understanding of NOAAs requirements.  The Government is also soliciting information from the small business community.  Small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and HUBZone businesses are invited to submit relevant information for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and small business subcontracting goals for this requirement.  

2.  NOAA has posted three related documents on the NOAA GOES-R Program Office Web site at http://osd.goes.noaa.gov/ac.php to assist potential offerors understanding of preliminary Ground Segment (GS) objectives and requirements.  The documents are the GOES-R GS Acquisition and Operations (A&O) Procurement Concept, the GOES-R GS Functional and Performance Specifications (F&PS), and the GOES-R GS Concept of Operations (CONOPS).  The Procurement Concept document provides information on the GOES-R Program background, GS objectives, the system integration concept, a GS effectivity concept with high level milestones, contracting method and management information requirements, planned Government furnished property items, and the anticipated GS procurement schedule.      

3.  This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  The GOES-R GS procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time.

4.  The preliminary documents described in this notice constitute all information concerning the procurement of the GOES-R GS that will be furnished at this time.  Firms interested in obtaining a hardcopy of this synopsis and preliminary documents described herein must submit a request, in writing, to David Runner, Contracting Officer, NASA/GSFC, GOES-R Code 417, Bldg 6, Room S104, Greenbelt, MD, 20771 

C.  Government Requested Information from Potential Prime Offerors

1.   NOAA invites potential prime offerors to submit the information described below:
a.	Expression of Interest and Prospective Team 
b.	Capability Information
c.	Relevant Past Performance
d.	General feedback on GS objectives, schedules, and requirements

2.   The expression of interest information should identify the prime contractors prospective team members.  This list should include any major interdivisional participation and first tier subcontractors, and should show the general division of work planned for each team member.

3.  Capability information should include a discussion of the potential offerors understanding of the GOES-R GS requirements, the key technologies that can be applied to GOES-R, lifetime requirements in driving design considerations, lessons learned in past ground systems development that can be applied to GOES-R, and any preliminary design and risk reduction activities that are relevant to GOES-R.  This section should also include a brief description of the potential offerors facilities, financial condition and other resources necessary for developing, producing, integrating, and testing the GOES-R GS.  Include the availability of facilities and other resources.      

4.  Relevant past performance information should include a discussion of the potential offerors past experience in developing and supporting the operations of ground systems for  systems similar in nature to GOES.  The past performance information should include a listing of contracts/subcontracts, and a brief description of the quality of performance on these contracts, the relevance of the experience, and any other past performance history that demonstrates an ability to successfully perform the GOES-R GS contract.

5.  General feedback from potential offerors should include the identification of significant technical and schedule risks, and specific comments on any aspect of the Governments preliminary GS Procurement Concept, GS F&PS, and GS CONOPS.  Prime offeror teams are also encouraged to provide comments on alternative approaches to the Governments requirements.

6.  NOAA has requested this information to allow the Government to perform an informal review of potential prime offerors possible viability as competitors for the prime GS contract.  NOAA may ask for supplemental information.  Potential prime offerors that submit responsive information will be notified by email that NOAA has received the information.  NOAA does not intend to formally advise each submitter of their potential to be a viable competitor for the prime GS contract; however, NOAA may do so informally.  Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submission, submitters may participate in any resultant GS acquisition. 

7.  Potential prime offerors interested in submitting proposals for the prime GS contract and/or those who intend to respond with information to this synopsis are requested to contact David Runner within three days of receiving this notice.  All requested information and comments on the preliminary documents are due by 5:00 PM EDT, May 31, 2007, to the address cited in paragraph B.4. above; email responses will also be accepted at david.t.runner@noaa.gov and mary.petruzzo@noaa.gov.  Information submittals are limited to 15 pages, cover to cover.  Use 8.5 inches x 11 inches white paper, 10 point font, single sided print, and no foldouts or elaborate graphics.  NOAA will only accept information and comment packages from potential prime offerors; prospective subcontractors should not submit separate packages.  Small business firms should follow instructions in paragraph D of this announcement.

	8.  NOAA invites potential prime offerors and their team mates to participate in one-on-one discussions with the GOES-R GS Project Office and NOAA procurement personnel.  This discussion period is open starting May 16, 2007, and will continue until June 8, 2007.  Discussions are limited to a two hour period per team, and will be held at NOAA headquarters facilities in Silver Spring, Maryland.  Potential prime offeror team participation is limited to 10 people.  Potential prime offerors are requested to contact David Runner to schedule a discussion with NOAA.

	9.  The GOES-R Ground Project intends to release a draft request for proposal (RFP) for ground segment effort in the June to July 2007 time frame.  It is the responsibility of potential prime offerors to monitor FedBizOpps for further NOAA acquisition announcements.

10. This announcement is for information purposes only; it is not a solicitation.  Any information or documents submitted by vendors will be used for market research purposes only.  Additional details regarding the GOES-R GS acquisition will be provided subsequently. 

D.  Government Requested Information from Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business/Women and/or Veteran Owned Businesses/HUBZone Businesses

Businesses under this category who wish to provide information should submit data similar to that required for the potential prime offerors.  Responses should not exceed 8 pages.  This information will be used to assess an appropriate level of competition and the level of subcontracting goals for the prime contract.  Please note, however, that the Government does not intend to perform any viability assessment or notify the business entity as to their viability to participate in this requirement.  Please send all small business responses directly to the NOAA Small Business Representative, Lawrence Frazier, by email at lawrence.b.frazier@noaa.gov.  Mr. Frazier may be contacted by telephone at (301) 713-4179.

<SUBJECT>V--Request for Information/Comments
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued to solicit comments and suggestions from industry on changes that are proposed by the Department of the Interior, Aviation Management Call When Needed (CWN) Single Engine Air tanker (SEAT) contracting program.  There are two major categories of changes. One is the CWN SEAT program and the second is a New Extended Use SEAT program. Your comments and suggestions are invited on any and all of the proposed changes. Please refer to the numbered item when preparing your response. Proposed Changes to Department of the Interior (DOI), Aviation Management (AM) Call When Needed (CWN) Single Engine Air tanker (SEAT) contracting. 1.	Seat Base Ramp Parking- Effective with the 2008 season, only contractors who are actively on a contract call-out and are being paid for their services will be permitted to park aircraft, crews and support equipment on Government controlled aircraft  ramp.  Contractors intending to pre-position aircraft must make alternative parking and logistics arrangements. 2.	Reduction in Exclusive Use contracts - Shift to On Call contracts -The number of exclusive use SEAT aircraft will be reduced dramatically.  The new emphasis will be placed on contracts awarded by the DOI, Aviation Management designated as "On-Call" contracts.  The "On-Call" designation will assist in avoiding confusion with contracts awarded by other agencies. As in the past vendors are not required to respond to a dispatch request, nor under this contract does the Government guarantee a vendor any specific number of days on any given call up. 3.	Point of Hire Change- Effective with the 2008 season, the point of hire (and release) will no longer be a vendor's place of business. (See exception below) All points of hire will be one of the Designated Dispatch Points (DDP) located below.  The specific DDP will be identified at the time the order is placed.  It will be the contractor's responsibility and cost to move aircraft, personnel and support equipment to (and from) the DDP.    The bid schedule shall allow for only one rate to be offered for aircraft, personnel and support equipment, regardless of the DDP. 4.	DDP Exception - If a contractor's base of operation is closer to the incident (fire) location, the point of hire (and release) may be the contractor's base of operation.  For the purposes of defining the "contractor's base of operation" it shall be the location from which the contractor conducts business as indicated on SF1449, Block 17a, or other locations identified in the contract. Exercising this exception is at the sole discretion of the ordering office. 5.	Basis for Order- Orders under this contract shall be made on a best value basis. Best value shall include 1) aircraft capability; 2) aircraft location; 3) availability of aircraft and 4) overall cost to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest offeror, if determined to be the best value. New Department of the Interior, Aviation Management Extended Term On-Call Single Engine Air tanker (SEAT) contract. This contract is anticipated to replace a significant number of current Exclusive Use Contracts.  Unlike the On Call SEAT contract (above), which has no guarantees other than day to day; this new contract will afford both vendors and the Government with a guaranteed term of order.  However there are no guarantees of work until such time as an order has been placed and accepted by the contractor. 6.	Point of Hire Change- Effective with the 2008 season, the point of hire (and release) will no longer be a vendor's place of business. (See exception below) All points of hire will be one of the Designated Dispatch Points (DDP) located below.  The specific DDP will be identified at the time the order is placed.  It will be the contractor's responsibility and cost to move aircraft, personnel and support equipment to (and from) the DDP.    The bid schedule shall allow for only one rate to be offered for aircraft, personnel and support equipment, regardless of the DDP. 7.	 DDP Exception - If a contractor's base of operation is closer to the incident (fire) location, the point of hire (and release) may be the contractor's base of operation.  For the purposes of defining the "contractor's base of operation" it shall be the location from which the contractor conducts business as indicated on SF1449, Block 17a, or other locations identified in the contract. Exercising this exception is at the sole discretion of the ordering office. 8.	Bid Page Change-   The bid page shall afford a vendor the opportunity to present a daily availability price based upon a guaranteed order of 30/60/90 consecutive calendar days. A vendor may offer a different rate for each term. A vendor may offer on one or all terms.   The rates shall remain in effect for the duration of the order, including any extensions from the original term.  The Government reserves the right to determine which term of order is required for each incident/fire. A vendor is not required to respond to any dispatch (order) under this contract.  9.	Basis for Order- Orders under this contract shall be made on a best value basis. Best value shall include 1) aircraft capability; 2) aircraft location; 3) availability of aircraft and 4) overall cost to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest offeror, if determined to be the best value. For the 2008 ON Call and Extended Term SEAT contracts the following cities are Designated Dispatch Points (DDP): Boise, Idaho Reno, Nevada Grand Junction, Colorado Phoenix, Arizona Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas Atlanta, Georgia Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota Please forward your comments and suggestions to me by September 24, 2007.

<SUBJECT>B--This is a notice to inform of the Government's intent to award a sole-source contract to Wyle Laboratories for a NoiseMap Simulation Model in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park.
<DESC>Performance Work Statement: Integration of Visitor Use Simulations and Sound Modeling to Estimate Noise Levels from Recreational Activity 1  General information 1.1  Background The National Park Service (NPS) Organic Act (16 U.S.C. l 2 3, and 4) requires that resources of National Park units be preserved unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations, and Section 4.9 of the National Park Service Management Policies (2006) applies this requirement to the preservation of acoustic resources in National Park units. Sounds associated with visitor transportation and hiking can affect the movements and behavior of wildlife, as well as the quality of other visitor's experience. Accordingly, the NPS Natural Sounds Program needs analytical tools that can model and estimate sounds associated with visitor activities. 1.2  Objective This project will demonstrate estimation of sound levels from visitor activities by integrating data from a visitor activity model with the NoiseMap Simulation Model (NMSim), using data from the Big Creek Watershed of Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM). 1.3  Scope of Work The Acoustics Division of Wyle Laboratories (Wyle) will utilize acoustic data collected by NPS to develop an ambient sound level model for the Big Creek Watershed of GRSM. This model will be implemented in NMSim. This sound level model will include ambient sound level characterizing acoustic conditions in the absence of anthropogenic noise, available information regarding traffic on nearby roads and aircraft overflights, data regarding hiker movement patterns and sound production, and hiker activity data produced by visitor use simulation model. 2  Government-furnished property and services        1.  Natural ambient sound level data, excluding the effects of anthropogenic noise.        2.  Data describing the sound source levels of hikers in GRSM.        3.  As available, data regarding road traffic and aircraft overflights. 3  Contractor-furnished items and services        1. The software development environment for NMSim.        2.  Programming support to modify NMSim.        3.  Equipment and supplies to support software development and data analysis.        4.  At least one technical expert to participate in meetings and web conferences with NPS and other research             groups contributing to the project. 4  Specific tasks         1. Perform the following noise modeling analysis:               A.  Work with NPS to translate sound level and visitor source level data into formats suitable for                                    integration into NMSim.               B.  Work with Dr. Steve Lawson and NPS to obtain data on visitor use patterns in the study area.               C.  Work with NPS to integrate any available information regarding traffic on nearby roads and aircraft                          overflight activity.               D.  Develop a process to translate visitor use data from visitor use simulations into a format suitable for                    ingestion into NMSim.         2. Produce the following documentation:               A.  Ambient noise maps using NMSim documenting anthropogenic noise levels from hiker sounds alone,                     from all other sources, and from all sources combined.               B.  A technical report documenting the improved noise modeling capabilities of NMSim.        3.

<SUBJECT>Advanced Techniques in Command Control Services to Improve Situation Awareness
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC-SD) requires engineering support in support of the in the architectural design, site survey, development, integration, certification testing and demonstrating the Trusted Information Infrastructure TM (TII TM). Specifically, this contract requirement focuses on a solution for creating a data store that can protect documents/information, tag each document/attribute as it is written and store the documents/information so that only the tactical user with the correct credentials (program/security level) gain access to the sections of the document or attributes that they are authorized to view.  The solution will also allow for the automated or recommended classification/ program/ security level for a given paragraph, sentence and overall document or tactical information at the attribute level. The proposed requirement is needed to support the Secure Information Sharing (SIS) prototype.  For more than a decade, CSCI has been developing TII TM to meet the DCID 6/3 and Common Criteria 2.0. TII TM was designed in accordance with the Department of Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP).   CSCI has the necessary security background, cleared staff, and CSCIâ€™s TIITM provides for a compartmented foundational infrastructure certified and accredited by DSS, OSD, and DIA for Protection Level (PL) Three with PL4 services and required no waivers.  CSCI has the intellectual property rights to both the software and hardware that no other vendor can offer and can modify the necessary components to make this concept work with software applications that SSC-SD has developed.  TII TM structure is sectioned into three pillars of technology; Wide Area Network (WAN) Security, PL3 Common Operating Environments (COE) in Local Area Networks (LAN), and PL4 Controlled Interface. Six major objectives formed the underlying foundation in the development of TII TM: use of Commercial-off-the Shelf (COTS) products, re-use current infrastructure, network centric security approach, defense-in-depth security approach, reduction in cost of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), and simplified training and administration.  For these reasons, the Government intends to award a sole source cost plus fixed fee contract to CSCI for this effort. The contract Period of Performance is estimated at 36 months (a one (1) year base period with two (2) one (1) year options). The estimated value of the effort is not to exceed $6M.  This is an isolated procurement with no anticipated follow-on potential.

<SUBJECT>41 -- Intent to Award to Sole Source
<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This agency intends to award to Trane Pacific Service, 330 Sand Island Access Rd, Ste 103, Honolulu, HI, 96819 maintenance service for heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system located at the Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies, 2058 Maluhia road, Honolulu, HI 96815.  

The following items are required:

-two (2) Trane Air Cooled Screw Chillers
-One (1) BCU (Summit)
-Six (6) UPCM
-two (2) Direct Drive Pumps < 20HP
-2 Direct Drive Pumps > 20HP
-118 VAV Box, 66 Filters
-4 Variable Frequency Drives
-one (1) Desert Aire air conditioning unit (restrooms).
-one CompuAire unit
-BARD MN. WA602-A00XX4X  SN. 153B041883481-02

A contract for maintenance services will be awarded to Trane Pacific Service following no response back to this notice of intent.     APCSS requires maintenance services for the existing ventilation and HVAC systems.  The contract term will be one base year and four option years.  The estimated total contract value is less than $150,000.

Trane Pacific Service is the only service provider in the state of Hawaii that is authorized to perform service and maintenance on the Trane manufactured HVAC units.  This requirement is not available for ?full and open competition? because the HVAC equipment and software is proprietary.  Market research indicates other companies? can purchase repair parts (from Trane), however they lack the expertise to repair software or circuit boards break-downs.  Award to another source would result in: (a) additional costs such as replacement equipment and training would be incurred, (b) replacement of infrastructure currently in place, (c) no guarantee that only Trane manufactured replacement parts will be used, (d) no guarantee the repair person would be qualified to work on Trane equipment and (e) lapse of service.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN07-61, Proposer's Day Announcement for High Resolution Affordable Emissive Micro-Display (EMD)
<DESC>DARPA will host a Proposer's Day Workshop in support of the BAA08-02, High Resolution Affordable Emissive Micro-Displays (EMD) program on October 19, 2007 at ManTech SRS Technologies from 8:00am to 12:00pm.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the High Resolution Affordable Emissive Micro-Displays (EMD) program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the High Resolution Affordable Emissive Micro-Displays (EMD) program is to develop a new generation of emissive micro-displays with high brightness, long lifetime, good electrical efficiency, and low cost. The principal application target for this new capability is the emergent arena of dynamic holography. Current micro-displays are expensive, optically inefficient, unsuitable for tiling into large area displays, or incapable of achieving long lifetimes at the necessary level of brightness and spatial resolution. 

Key objective parameters include, but are not limited to, a production cost less than $30/cm2, high image quality reaching a pixel pitch less than 20 microns, brightness greater than 300 cd/m2 and a lifetime of more than 20,000 hours.  The display should be tileable with seams no larger than 1 mm.  As these are the minimum expected values, continued optimization of these parameters is expected.  Additional parameters will be listed in the BAA08-02 and at the Proposer's Day Conference. 

REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register NLT October 12, 2007.  Please send an email to BAA08-02@darpa.mil requesting a Proposer's Day registration form.   Instructions for registering will be on the registration form.  Directions to the facility and other materials will be sent via e-mail once the registration form has been received.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  

Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 30 registrants, and no more than 2 representatives per organization.  The Proposer's Day will be unclassified and open to the general public.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference.  Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60, "Foreign National Visit Request".  The completed Citizenship Form or DARPA Form 60 must be faxed to:  Christine Bonsby, ManTech SRS Technologies, fax 703-807-0976, phone 703-351-7293, no later than October 12, 2007.  The necessary document will be emailed, once the registration form has been received.  Attendance is not required to propose to any associated BAA.  

Additionally, attendees who would like to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference may request to do so.  Presentations may contain 2 slides and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues).  Proposers desiring to reserve a time to present at the Proposer's Day Conference should contact Christine Bonsby at BAA08-02@darpa.mil or 703-351-7293 as soon as possible, but no later than the registration cutoff date for the Proposer's Day Conference.  

All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by both the organization that funded the research and the DARPA Program Manager.  The DARPA Program Manager will review and approve in advance any presentations to ensure there is no material that is subject to the Department of State's International Traffic in Arms Regulations.  It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all material they plan to present at the Proposer's Day Conference has been approved by the funding organization in advance.  An electronic copy of all material to be presented must be provided to the DARPA Program Manager for review by October 10, 2007.  There will be no exceptions to this requirement.

ASPR (Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response) requires this service in order to meet and continually improve emergency response capabilities.

The Court Services and Offenders Supervision Agency is seeking a qualified, capable, and interested small businesses to provide Community Coordination Services in support of the Agency?s Violence Reduction program. 

The Violence Reduction Program (VRP) is a programmatic intervention that blends best practices from the literature ? such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mentoring ? into a three-phase treatment intervention for men, aged 18-35 with histories of violent, weapons, and/or drug distribution convictions.  The goal of the Violence Reduction Program is to help offenders:

- Develop non-violent approaches to conflict resolution.
- Increase problem-solving skills.
- Adopt communication styles that improve social skills.
- Establish an alternative peer network by promoting pro-social supports and accountability networks.
- Learn and apply skills to regulate anxiety.

Each year, CSOSA organizes up to eight cohorts of approximately 15-25 offenders to participate in Violence Reduction Program Groups.  Offenders are referred to VRP cohorts based on their residence in or near four Washington, DC neighborhoods:  Columbia Heights, Marshall Heights, Congress Heights, and a fourth area to be named in FY 2007.
 
Phase I:  Assessment and Treatment Readiness (6 weeks)
- Offenders receive comprehensive psychological and educational assessments to determine program suitability.
- Offenders attend weekly treatment readiness sessions that introduce them to the cognitive-behavioral intervention model.

Phase II:  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (12 weeks)
- Offenders participate in cognitive behavioral therapy (Controlling Anger & Learning to Manage It ? CALM).  
- CALM is a 24-session group training program intended to reduce anger, violence, and emotional loss of control in males with a history of these challenges. 
- CALM employs psycho-educational instruction, role-plays, discussions, practical exercises, and homework assignments to convey new knowledge and skills to participants.  

Phase III:  Aftercare and Community Reintegration
- Offenders must participate in up to eight (8) weekly aftercare groups.
- Offenders may choose to continue to participate in up to ten (10) VRP alumni groups.

The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.

Federal Maritime Commission
Performance Work Statement
Document scanning/indexing
1.Background
The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) is an independent regulatory agency responsible for the regulation of ocean borne transportation in the foreign commerce of the United States.  The FMC administers the Shipping Act of 1984, as amended by Public Law 105-258 (The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998), Section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988 and Public Law No. 89-777.  All of these statues were amended and modified by the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which took effect on May 1, 1999.  To achieve its statutory mandates, the FMC relies on technology to support its mission.

The Office of the Secretary (OS) is the public's main contact point with the FMC.  The OS receives and processes a variety of documents filed by the public, including:  complaints initiating adjudicatory proceedings for alleged violations of the shipping statutes and other applicable laws; special docket applications and applications to correct clerical or administrative errors in service contracts; all communications, petitions, notices, pleadings, briefs, or other legal instruments in administrative proceedings; subpoenas served on the FMC or members and employees thereof; and Freedom of Information Act requests and other information requests.  In addition, the OS maintains a Public Reference/Docket Library and provides for the issuance of publications and the authentication of instruments and documents of the FMC.  The documents in the scanning and indexing system are stored electronically on large volume storage devices.  

The Commission's OS also coordinates the provision of scanning, indexing, and retrieval support for other Commission offices including the Office of General Counsel and various operating bureaus.  

2.Objective/Scope
The primary objective is to employ the services of a contractor to perform on-site scanning and indexing services for the FMC using the FMC's scanning equipment located in the OS.  In addition, the contractor will assist with verifying files and documents maintained in the scanning system against existing logs. This would require, for example, comparison of documents listed in logs against electronic documents to verify that documents have been digitized and stored in our system prior to sending paper files to long-term storage.  The contractor will also be required to assist with verifying that files from the old scanning system have been correctly transferred and organized into the new scanning system based on their ability to apply subject matter knowledge.  The contractor is expected to offer suggestions to improve functionality and processes involved with the scanning program.  Within broad parameters outlined by OS staff, the scanning contractor will be required to research and compile information necessary to accurately index and organize electronically converted files.  Working independently, the scanning contractor will be required to prioritize assignments within the parameters established by the OS staff to meet weekly or project deadlines.  Should any work be scheduled for performance at the contractor's facilities, the scanned and indexed files must conform to the FMC's formatting requirements and must be retrievable through the FMC's existing hardware and software technologies.  Currently the FMC uses Laserfiche 7.2 as its document scanning software/system.  Should the need arise, additional contract labor resources may be required, and will be negotiated pursuant to the PWS and contractor's labor category schedule.

3.Deliverables
The contractor shall be responsible for providing 40 hours of on-site labor in accordance with this PWS 52 weeks per year, excluding the following federal holidays.  Should the need arise, additional contract labor resources may be required, and will be negotiated pursuant to the PWS and contractor's labor category schedule.

7.Government Furnished Resources
The FMC will provide access to its building and offices, the required network access, and any available technical documentation regarding the existing scanning system and process.  Training on FMC procedures and scanning equipment/software will be provided by designated FMC staff or FMC-approved vendors.

8.Personnel Security Requirements
The contractor shall immediately notify the COTR of any changes in personnel assigned to this award.  Any new personnel will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement before they can begin work.

9.Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)
The Government will periodically evaluate the Contractor's performance in accordance with the QASP. The purpose of the QASP is to ensure reliable, uninterrupted services are provided in accordance with the PWS.  The plan will also ensure unnecessary complaints and acceptable performance.
The Government's QASP includes the following elements:
Periodic inspection of the Contractor's work
Communicating customer complaints
Progress meetings with the Contractor 

Method of Surveillance:
Random Evaluation: This method employs a "spot check" style of evaluation and may be adjusted, based on quality trends.  The Government retains the right to inspect all requirements of the contract. Unacceptable performance will be recorded and the Contractor shall be required to correct the unacceptable condition within a 24-hour time period.  If the Contractor does not correct the unacceptable condition within 24-hours, the COTR will notify the Contracting Officer who will take appropriate administrative action for unacceptable performance.

<DESC>The Coast Guard is intending to "Sole Source Contract" for the continued developement of the Loran/eLoran Network. Tasks include a network health assessment, a high-level security assessment, a strategic / future directions report, and installation and tuning of network management software. The current Loran network is undergoing a modernization effort and redesign to meet the mission goals of eLoran. The security of the Loran network is a primary issue. The Loran network is a stovepipe network that is privatized and secure. Access to the network is extremely limited to provide for a safe, proprietary means of operation. Access has been granted to limited personnel for preliminary work accomplished from March to May 2006 timeframe. Accessibility to other contractors paves the way for possible security concerns in the future, and resources are not in place to have the ability to mitigate those concerns.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The NAICS Code is 334611 with a size standard of 500 employees. The Department of Health and Human Services seeks to acquire a WebInspect perpetual user license and user license annual maintenance utilizing simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR 13.100, 12.603, and 12.602.  

The software will be used by Information Technology Auditors to perform vulnerability assessments of computer web applications and services during the normal review of operations at auditees.  The software, WebInspect by SPI Dynamics, can analyze the numerous Web applications and Web services in an auditee?s environment quickly and easily and is maintained and updated daily which is critical due to the ever changing environment of the web.

SPI Dynamics vulnerability database is one of the most comprehensive and accurate knowledgebases on the market.  WebInspect checks for all of the following vulnerabilities:

Command Execution, HTTP Compliance, SQL Injection, WebDAV Compliance, Cross-Site Scripting, SSL Strength, Directory Traversal, Certificate Analysis, Abnormal Input, Content Investigation, Parameter Overflow, Spam Gateway Detection, Buffer Overflow, Client-Side Pricing, Parameter Addition, Sensitive Developer Comments, Path Manipulation, WebServer/Web Package, Path Truncation, Identification, Character Encoding, Absolute Path Detection, MS-DOS 8.3 Short Filename, Error Message Identification, Character Stripping, Permissions Assessment, Site Search, Brute Force Authentication, Application Mapping, Known Attacks, State Management, Crawl, Directory Enumeration, Automatic Form-Filling, Web Server Assessment, SSL Support, Parameter Injection, Proxy Supp.

If the OIG attempted to conduct an audit without such a product, they would be unable to properly determine if proper controls were in place during an assessment.  The OIG has staff members who are familiar with the product as it is currently utilized for vulnerability assessments of their internal websites and services.  By standardiziing on an existing product, the OIG can share technical expertise, troubleshooting, and operational use by all staff.  This will also reduct the need for additional training from the vendor.  If OIG purchased a non-standard vulnerability web assessment tool, OIG could come under scrutinization by outside peer reviews for not following internal policy of standardization that has been dictated by the current HHS Secretary.  SPI Dynamics, Inc. is the exclusive manufacturer and provider.

Any and all interested offerors are encouraged to submit a quote.  Please request a copy of the RFQ from Clint Druk at clint.druk@psc.gov if you wish to be considered for this requirement.

All questions must be submitted in writing via email to Clint Druk at clint.druk@psc.gov by 2:00 PM EASTERN TIME Tuesday, September 19, 2007. All quotes must be submitted via electronic copy and to the addresses and locations cited in attached solicitation by section by 10:00 AM EASTERN TIME, Wednesday, September 20, 2007.  Quotes shall be in .pdf or Microsoft Word format.

This acquisition is a brand name only requirement based upon the excerpt from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and Approval.

Reflex Disknet Pro software was installed on the USSOCOM enterprise in January 2007, and provides USSOCOM Headquarters enterprise and local visibility of compliance with established network security policy. This requirement is to continue the maintenance and support of the system.  As the system is currently less than a year into service the costs associated with the purchase as outlined below would not be fully recouped if any competitor's software were able to be integrated as a replacement.   
Reflex Disknet Pro reveals how security policy is actually applied on the operational network. By highlighting systems and users that do not comply, command attention and resources may then be focused on strengthening the network security posture through better policy enforcement. Reflex Disknet Pro also provides information that will identify issues that are inadequately addressed by existing policy. This information enables USSOCOM to continually develop and refine its computer network security policy. Finally, due to its ability to monitor removable media at a highly granular level, Reflex Disknet Pro is a useful tool to mitigate the risk necessitated by operational requirements. The software is the only CJCSI 6510.01D approved software which allows USSOCOM to meet the following requirements:
	Provide an  enterprise-wide solution with a policy driven mechanism of securing information
	Provide an automated capability to ensure data integrity across the enterprise
	Provide a  central control of access to removable media, as well as user access to floppy disk, CD/DVD ROM, Zip/Jazz drives, memory sticks, PDA and flash memory allowing all removable media/IO devices to be authorized before use is granted and for authorization to be centrally managed or authorized with Active Directory group management
	Provide a profile based file management capability to prevent users from creating defined file types on local workstation and or network drives
	Provide device management through administrative control of user access to all PC ports.
	Provide ability to control USB, IrDA, Com, Firewire and LPT ports 
	Provide detailed auditing capability. All events are centrally logged in an SQL database with the ability to create structured queries and detailed reports. All file operations on all removable storage devices including CDs/DVDs, thumb drives and PDAs, can be audited. 
	Provide tracking of user behavior and system security
	Automatically detects and integrate with compatible anti-virus scanners
	Ensure data can only be accessed by authorized personnel, on authorized systems
	Provide enterprise and local visibility of compliance with established network security policy (show how security policy is actually applied on the operational network) 
	Provide the automated capability to identify issues not captured by existing policy
	Provide capability to mitigate the risk necessitated by operational requirements
	Provide an automated application verification and  audit analysis capability 
	Provide visibility into enterprise operations and potential security threats
	Quantifies the status of enterprise security providing the necessary information for continuous improvements
	Provide a capability to build security analysis into existing policy and automate event response
	Provide capability to identify and prioritize potential network vulnerabilities
	Provide a common policy definition for network operation among enterprise stakeholders  
	Ensure only approved file types can be accessed on removable drives.
	Ensure only authorized digitally tagged disk can be used when using floppy disk, or during removable media authorization; enforcing a complete virus check of all removable media.

United States Special Operations Command requires this brand name only support as award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The approximate cost of the duplication effort would be $899,497.00, as outlined in the table below.  These costs are based on expenditures under the current contract that have been incurred to gain a level of operational acceptance by the government for contractors and government employees.  

The cost that would not be recovered through open competition involves resources for testing and operational readiness (certification and accreditation, operational compatibility and continuity) with the current network architecture and the risk associated to downtime and lack of coverage during a replacement phase of new technology.   

Award will be made to the quotation which offers the best value to the government.  The Government also reserves the right to make no award at all.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. 

This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-20.  This acquisition is a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 624190 and the Business Size Standard is $6.5M.  This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  The Court Services and Offenders Supervision Agency is seeking a qualified, capable, and interested small businesses to provide Community Coordination Services in support of the Agency?s Violence Reduction program. 

The Violence Reduction Program (VRP) is a programmatic intervention that blends best practices from the literature ? such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mentoring ? into a three-phase treatment intervention for men, aged 18-35 with histories of violent, weapons, and/or drug distribution convictions.  The goal of the Violence Reduction Program is to help offenders:

- Develop non-violent approaches to conflict resolution.
- Increase problem-solving skills.
- Adopt communication styles that improve social skills.
- Establish an alternative peer network by promoting pro-social supports and accountability networks.
- Learn and apply skills to regulate anxiety.

Each year, CSOSA organizes up to eight cohorts of approximately 15-25 offenders to participate in Violence Reduction Program Groups.  Offenders are referred to VRP cohorts based on their residence in or near four Washington, DC neighborhoods:  Columbia Heights, Marshall Heights, Congress Heights, and a fourth area to be named in FY 2007.
 
Phase I:  Assessment and Treatment Readiness (6 weeks)
- Offenders receive comprehensive psychological and educational assessments to determine program suitability.
- Offenders attend weekly treatment readiness sessions that introduce them to the cognitive-behavioral intervention model.

Phase II:  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (12 weeks)
- Offenders participate in cognitive behavioral therapy (Controlling Anger & Learning to Manage It ? CALM).  
- CALM is a 24-session group training program intended to reduce anger, violence, and emotional loss of control in males with a history of these challenges. 
- CALM employs psycho-educational instruction, role-plays, discussions, practical exercises, and homework assignments to convey new knowledge and skills to participants.  

Phase III:  Aftercare and Community Reintegration
- Offenders must participate in up to eight (8) weekly aftercare groups.
- Offenders may choose to continue to participate in up to ten (10) VRP alumni groups. 
- ?Community Life Coaches? volunteer to guide offenders as they navigate their neighborhoods, while reinforcing use of relaxation and stress management techniques and cognitive skills acquired during CALM.
- Offenders continue to learn and practice valuable stress reduction and relaxation techniques.
- Offenders complete community service projects to repair the harm caused by crime.

- Develop and deliver a curriculum for support groups designed to promote a pro-social, long-term relationship between individual Community Life Coaches and offenders.

<DESC>III.STATEMENT OF WORK
The following are the major types of activities that the contractor will be performing for the Directorate of Science, Technology and Medicine (DSTM and other OSHA organizations as appropriate.
1.Assistance to Support Stakeholders in Safety and Health Matters.  The term "stakeholders" refers to all private and governmental bodies at the Federal and state level that may need OSHA's input regarding occupational safety and health issues or that could be affected by OSHA programs. OSHA works closely with all stakeholders on program that would promote the safety and health of workers. Such programs include simplifying and streamlining regulations, interagency cooperation, partnership, customer services, and special initiatives. OSHA provides special assistance to small businesses to promote voluntary compliance. OSHA pays special attention to high hazard industries such as construction, to high hazard occupations such as hazardous waste and foundry workers, and to hazardous materials including chemical and biological agents. OSHA's outreach programs include disseminating technical information in a form appropriate for the audience. These forms include written guidance in plain English, videotapes, interactive software, reports and a variety of electronic methods. In connection with this effort, the Contractor shall provide the following types of services:

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<ARCHDATE>09172008
<CONTACT>Theresa M. Velasquez Contracting Officer 3032313937     theresa.velasquez.mms.gov;
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to show the following questions and answers on Solicitation Number M07RQ14670. Provide EMC Documentum electronic records functionality, or provide an automated migration path to EMC Documentum Records Manager" Question:  That text appears in the introduction rather than in the "Requirements" secion.  Does this imply that connectivity with EMC is an optional or future component of the eFOIA system?  Connectivity with EMC is a requirement.  Section I Operational and Functional Requirements: "Redaction: There must be a redaction capability within the system or a way to integrate with the Appligent Redax software to redact PDF documents" Question.  Does MRM currently use Appligent Redax?   Yes.  Section II Records Management Storage and maintenance: The system must provide for the storage, maintenance, and access to the current and historical electronic records. Question: Does the customer have the expectation that legacy records (released and reviewed documents,  past correspondence with requesters, for example) will be imported into the new system?  If so, can MRM provide guidance on the number, complexity, and size of those documents?   We need the capability delivered, but the contractor will not be asked to import the legacy records identified in the question.  The number, size and complexity of the documents is information which will require too much time to pull together for purposes of this solicitation.    Section IV, Integration. "Compatible: System must be compatible with Windows XP.  If the software uses other COTS for databases, MRM prefers MS SQL Server" Question: Can MRM please provide the following: - preferred version of MS SQLServer  2005  - current desktop browser version  Internet Explorer 6.0.2900.2180  Section VIII: Quantities and Location "4 licenses plus 1 administrator license must be included in the proposal" "Locations: 5 seats are located in Lakewood, ...." Questions:      Does the MRM FOIA team consist of 4 active users, or is it 5 active users (one of which would also act as system administrator)?  5 active users      Of the 4 or 5 users, how many are in each of the following roles:            - clerical / data entry  -1             - FOIA analysts/officers  -3                 - FOIA team management /system administrator   -1       Of the 4 or 5 users, do all team members actively work on FOIA request all day every day, or is there some known      "pattern" to predict how many members would be logged in to the system at any point in time.  The 3 FOIA Analysts/Officers actively work on FOIA requests all day most days.  The FOIA Team Manager /system administrator would only use the system occasionally to review progress and obtain statistics for reporting purposes  and administer/update the system as necessary .  The clerical/data entry person would access the system daily, but would not be in the system all day.        (Any clarification that you can bring on roles and responsibilities would be much appreciated) Section IX Other "Migration:  The contractor shall convert data from the legacy FOIA Access Tracking database to the provided system" Question:  In order to provide an accurate estimate on the cost of data conversion, we would need to know the following information. - how many requests (total count) are in the current database?   434 closed, 63 appeals, and 72 current  - how many requesters are in the current database?  There are 620 combined requesters and internal contacts in the database  - how many internal contacts / record owners are stored in the current database   see above question  - can MRM provide -at a minimum- the database schema(s) for the Access database   Providing the schema would likely create more questions than answers.  We are providing a copy of  the MRM FOIA ACCESS DATABASE data entry guide instead. Other topics not specifically covered in the RFP: Question: Can MRM provide any guidance on the number of requests processed in a typical year?  It varies from 45 to 75.    Question: Can MRM provide guidance on the size of potentially responsive documents to a typical request?  Varies from 1 page to thousands of pages, typically around a couple of hundred pages.                   (an approximate page count of the smallest, larges, and "typical" request would be helpful) Question: The RFP does not make mention of the "scoring system" to be used to rate the proposals.  Can you please provide clarification on how bids will be evaluated and scored?

DESCRIPTION: FCI Sandstone, Sandstone MN, operates a rear gate sallyport system consisting of two sliding gates with J operators and interlocks.  Each gate has a vehicular and man gate component.  The gates are installed in a manner that prohibits a component of one gate from being opened unless both components of the other gate is closed.  Gates are controlled by the Control Center.  The control panel at the Control Center is connected by approximately 1500 feet of wiring bundle to the gate systems, which includes a relay cabinet located in the sallyport.  The operating mechanisms of the inner sallyport gate are inoperative.  The clutch, track wear plate, pulley, drive motor, and sensor switches of the vehicular component of the inner gate system have failed.  

SCOPE OF WORK: The scope of work is to replace the J operator and gate, including new overhead track and all associated clutch, track wear plate, pulley, chain, and motor mechanisms, for the inner gate.  The existing gate panel, track, and gate posts may be re-used.  Existing power circuits in the sallyport area will need to be extended to the new operator and Control Center as needed.  New relays will be installed as necessary at either the sallyport relay cabinet and/or control center panel.  Motor mechanisms will include overload protection and provision for manual operation of the gate system.  Gearbox systems will include heaters to ensure continuing lubrication capability of lubricants contained within.  Motor gearbox will be locked with a prison lock.  Detention quality hardware and tamperproof screws will be used in securing access panels, covers, hatches, and other points of entrance to the overall system.  The existing gate panel is approximately 14ft. x 14ft.  Photographs are enclosed (in hard copy bid packet) showing the gate and slider, operator and track detail, and man gate/sliding gate in it?s entirety.  Contractor will furnish all parts, material, labor and installation services to implement the requirements of this scope of work.  Contractors are encouraged to visit the site, and can contact the COTR, Steve Hansberry, at (320) 245-6530 or Shansberry@bop.gov to set up a day/time.

 	-Are the units to be of rotary or static design?  Rotary
	-Is the bid to be for two or three units?  Three
	-Are the primary and secondary cable/conductors to be   replaced?  I believe that the 	existing cabling could be reused to lessen the cost impact.If the cabling needs to be replaced that can be a separate maintenance issue.
	-The solicitation states ?Also, the contractor must have the NAICS code listed in this solicitation on their CCR registration? 335312 is for motor and generator manufacturing. 	Is this required? Yes 
	-Do Davis Bacon Wages apply? No ? since the cost of the converters exceed the cost of 	install this requirement is being treated as a supply, not a construction project.
	-Are certified payrolls required?  No since Davis Bacon does not apply
	-What are the work hours?  730-4:30- unless approved through the contracting officer
	-Who is to furnish escorts?  We will furnish the escorts
	-What durations are available for outages?  As long as each unit can be isolated and 	replaced individually there should not be an outage.
	-Is there a desired outage time during the remove and replacement?  No more than 48 hours.
	-Can the existing conduit be re-used when possible?  Yes as long as it meets code requirements.The existing conduit is aluminum.
	-Can the new units be delivered on-site, or will it have to be transported on to the base by the installer? The government does not want to get into the practice of loading and 	unloading the equipment.The contractor should coordinate the delivery so it can be off loaded and set in place that day or in a location where the contractor can load it at a later 	date.The government will not accept any liability during this process
-Is there any existing Exhaust Fans or any kind of Air Movement available in the Frequency Converter Room?  This question is not applicable because we are requesting rotary converters.
-If no ventilation exists, would it be possible to have Ventilation Installed?  This question is not applicable because we are requesting rotary converters.
-Can we bid a Static designed system versus a rotary that is designed for 50 degrees C?  No
	-When each converter is removed, wiring of the new SSFC (Solid State Frequency 	Converter) is to the existing panels feeding the 460 VAC into the unit; and the SSFC unit will feed existing 400Hz Load panels?  We are not going to use SSFC?s.
-Is the 400 Hz Load distribution panel in each converter room within site of the existing converter? (This is a code requirement)  Yes, the main 400 Hz switchgear is within line of site of the converters.  From there they feed out to the 400 Hz distribution panels throughout the facility.  They can be locked and tagged at the switchgear.
-Do individual 400 Hz branch circuit breakers feed each Back Shop, each aircraft test equipment, and/or each trainer? Yes
	-Are Spare Parts required for the support of the new SSFCs?  No.  We are requesting a maintenance contract with warranty.  Again rotary only.

	-Is an Operation Training Course required?  Just an Operational Procedures Manual.
	-Is a Maintenance Training Course required?  No due to the maintenance contract.

	-Is it required to install new 460 Volt feeder Circuit breakers in existing panel? The breakers do not need to be replaced unless the new converters require a change in the size 	based on code requirement.
	-Is it the US Government's requirements that the SSFC have an identical minimum output rating?  All rotary units will be identical.
		-Is the specified 577 Amps a "per phase,? number? This is 199 kVA, as stated above?  			No.  It is 3 phase total amperage.
		-Please clarify that the equivalent 577 Amps, 3-pahse, corresponding to 199 kVA is at a 			Power Factor of 0.8?  Yes

9.                  What type of material is the roof constructed?

20.              Will the government obtain all applicable permits?

Answers:
2. A 40 degree temperature rise is required to reduce cure time.

 

3. A cure time is not required the air make up unit comes with that function anyway. The air make up unit is required for winter months. A cure time is dependent upon the inside temp in comparison to the outside air (intake temp).

 

4. I?m not sure there has not been a site visit by the company. The location just depends on where we want it but it should be in normal situations on the roof supported by the roof.

 

5. Not sure what these acronyms mean?

 

6. The booth will have to be a drive through.

 

7. We do not have them but could provide as needed.

 

8. It will be a flat roof so that it can go inside the building.

 

9. I do not know what ever they provide the roof has no load bearing.

 

10. I do not think so it will be a roof inside of a building.

 

11. 8 feet

 

12. I have discussed this with TECQ and EPA region 12 and they never said anything about that. They did talk about the ducting not being on the same side of the other buildings air intake unit.

 

13. The dimensions are correct and should fit into the place we have planned.

 

14. I do not have drawings the company would need to do a site visit to determine this. I could get you the measurements and a drawing on a piece of paper if needed.

 

15. The booth will be used 5 days a week and average 20 gallons a week. It should come with a 1 year warranties I also put in the contract for 1 additional year beyond that. There was also a statement for them to train us what repairs we could perform without voiding the warranty.

 

16. I do not know.

 

17. That will be up to the QEA assigned to over see the contract. 

 

18. No the building is newer and should not contain any asbestos. The base has just put a new roof on that building as well.

 

19. Not a clue on this one I think the company would have added this when they sent their quote.

Statement of Work for Commercial Lease of Administrative Vehicles
U. S. Department of State
(A/OPR/GSM/FMO)

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Continuous long term (e.g., twelve consecutive months or longer) lease of administrative vehicles.

VEHICLE SUMMARY
The general types of vehicles required shall be as follows:
	Automobiles/Sedans: sub-compact, compact, mid-size, large executive, premium executive
	Passenger Vans: seven to fifteen passenger, front-wheel or all-wheel drive when available
	Cargo Vans: compact and full-size
	Pick Up Trucks: compact, mid- and full-sizes, 2- and 4-door, standard and extended cab, 4x2 and 4x4
	Sport Utility Vehicles: compact, mid- and full-sizes, 2- and 4-door, 4x2 and 4x4

The DOS will specify vehicle type and desired options on each call; Lessor may provide any manufacturer model vehicle that meets both DOS requirements and Buy American Act regulations.  Vehicles may be any color (black, dark blue, or white preferred), with the exception that large executive and premium executive sedans must be black or dark blue.  

Vehicles will be provided with flexible fuel gas/ethanol (E85) capability when available from manufacturers in the type and class of vehicle ordered.  Hybrid electric vehicles and vehicles operating on alternative fuels, such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or propane, are acceptable when available from manufacturers in the type and class of vehicle ordered, but must be approved in advance by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). It is the DOS's intent to burn biodiesel fuel in any diesel-powered vehicle provided by the Lessor, unless specifically prohibited by the vehicle manufacturer; it is the Lessor's responsibility to notify the COR of any such prohibitions prior to accepting the call for the vehicle.  The Lessor will not provide 4x4 vehicles unless specifically ordered or approved in advance by the COR.

LEASE TERMS
Basic Agreement Period: The BPA shall be valid for one base year with two one-year options. 

General: In response to this request for proposal (RFP), the Lessor will provide a price schedule for all vehicle types the Lessor will make available under this BPA; the Lessor's price proposal will become a formal part of the BPA upon award. While the Lessor is not required to provide a price schedule for every vehicle type listed above, the Lessor must include a price proposal for large executive and premium executive four-door sedans as a minimum. 

The DOS will initially lease individual vehicles for twelve (12) consecutive months; each individual lease may be extended in one-month or multiple-month intervals thereafter, not to exceed 36 months in total.  Prior to expiration of any given lease period as specified in the call, the Contracting Officer (CO) will issue a formal modification to extend the lease if needed; the modification will specify the number of additional months and the corresponding price per month as specified in the Lessor's price schedule. 

There is no guaranteed minimum quantity that the DOS will order.

Ordering: As requirements arise, the COR will notify the Lessor of desired vehicle types, quantities, specifications and lease duration by fax or email, based on vehicle types offered in the Lessor's proposal. Within two business days of receipt of a request from the COR, the Lessor will notify the COR (by return fax or email) of vehicle availability and delivery lead-time for each vehicle requested.  The Lessor may offer and the COR may accept substitution of specific vehicle types/options other than those initially requested by the COR when agreed to by the COR in advance and at no additional cost to the government.  Upon determination by the COR that the Lessor's response is satisfactory to meet requirements, the Contracting Officer (CO) will issue a formal call against the BPA for the agreed upon vehicle(s) at the price specified in the Lessor's price schedule. The Lessor will then provide vehicles to the COR within 15 days of issuance of the call by the CO, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the Lessor and the COR, in which case a not later than delivery date will be specified in the call. The Lessor will not provide vehicles to the COR until directed to do so by the CO via formal BPA call.

Extensions: Individual vehicle leases may be extended on a month-to-month or multiple-month basis by modification to the initial call prior to expiration of the call.  Existing calls may be extended and new calls may be issued up until the last day of the BPA base year or option year.  In those cases where the end of the period of performance specified in a call falls after the end of the BPA base/option year, the vehicle lease will terminate at the end of the period of performance specified in the individual call.  

Pricing:  For each vehicle type offered, the Lessor will provide a price schedule that includes standard per-month rates for months 1-12, months 13-24 and months 25-36. The DOS will issue calls for vehicle leases for any period of time ranging from twelve to 36 months, and will reimburse the Lessor the applicable rate for each month of the lease as specified in the Lessor's price schedule. (As a practical example, if the DOS issues a call for a vehicle lease for a 16 month period, the first twelve months will be invoiced/reimbursed at the monthly rate specified for months 1-12, and the next four months will be reimbursed at the rates specified for months 13-24.  Likewise, a 26 month lease will be invoiced/reimbursed at the rate specified for months 1-12 during the first twelve months, at the rates specified for months 13-24 for the next twelve months, and at the rates specified for months 25-36 for the last two months.) This rate structure will apply for all vehicles continuously leased by the DOS with no contractual break in service. For the purposes of this requirement, vehicles replaced during the specified lease period at the Lessor's discretion, because of maintenance problems, or due to age and mileage stipulations contained in other parts of this agreement, will be considered to be continuous, uninterrupted leases. 
Prices specified in the schedule will include no-charge mileage allowances available to the Lessor's best customers. Charges for cumulative mileage beyond Lessor-defined annual limits, if any, will be clearly defined in the Lessor's proposal. Finally, discounts for prompt payment will be defined in the Lessor's proposal.

Vehicle Replacements: The DOS may, at its option, require replacement of any vehicle that reaches three years of age or 45,000 miles during the agreed upon lease period, with the exception that the DOS may require replacement of large executive and premium executive sedans that reach two years of age or 30,000 miles. If this occurs, the Lessor will provide the replacement vehicle to the DOS for the remainder of the period specified in the call at no additional charge, and the replacement vehicle will be considered a continuous, uninterrupted lease as defined above. The Lessor may not replace any vehicle during the first 12-months of any lease period unless agreed upon in advance by the COR.

Termination:  
	General: Any vehicle(s) leased prior to the BPA expiration date will be retained by the DOS for the entire period of performance specified in the call regardless of the expiration date of the BPA; all terms and conditions of the BPA will remain in full force until the end of the lease period specified in each individual call.

	Grace Period:  At the end of each lease period, the Lessor will grant DOS a five workday grace period for DOS to ready the vehicle for return to the Lessor.  The Lessor will not charge DOS any lease fees during the grace period. Should the DOS fail to return the vehicle by the end of the grace period, the Lessor will be entitled to pro-rata payment for each day past the five-workday grace period (see Payments below). For the purposes of this requirement, a workday is defined as Monday through Friday, not including days the federal government is closed for business. 

	Delivery & Pick Up: The Lessor will deliver vehicles at the beginning of each lease period and retrieve vehicles at the end of each lease period at a location that is no more than 10 miles from the Main State building, located at 2201 C Street NW, Washington, DC 20520, unless otherwise agreed upon in advance by the Lessor and the COR. The cost of such delivery and retrieval shall be included in the Lessor's final price proposal.  The Lessor's responsibility for delivery shall be met when the Lessor notifies the COR that the vehicle is ready for pick up by the DOS at the agreed upon location. The DOS's responsibility for return of vehicles shall be met when the COR notifies the Lessor that the vehicle is available for pick up by the Lessor at the agreed upon location.

INVOICES AND PAYMENTS
Invoices: The Lessor will send invoices to the COR by the 10th day of each calendar month for each vehicle leased the previous calendar month.    The Lessor will bill monthly for all leases, regardless of the length of the lease specified in the call. Invoices shall clearly specify the vehicle ID number and all associate charges for the month. The Lessor will specify all credits and any applicable discounts offered to the DOS for prompt payment on each invoice.

Payments: DOS will verify and submit invoices for payment upon receipt from the Lessor. If it becomes necessary for any reason to determine a daily or monthly rate for pro-rata invoice adjustments, a daily rate will be determined by dividing the monthly rate specified in the call by 30 days. 

Charges for excess mileage beyond Lessor-defined annual limits and discount credits for prompt payment, if any, will be clearly identified on each invoice.  Excess mileage charges will be authorized for payment when such charges are in accordance with the Lessor's proposal and determined to be customary and reasonable by the COR. 


MAINTENANCE & REPAIRS 
The Lessor shall provide routine preventive maintenance (lubrication, oil/filter changes, replacement wipers and bulbs, etc.), breakdown maintenance/repairs, safety/emissions tests/inspections, and road-side assistance at no additional cost to DOS.  The Lessor will notify DOS when each vehicle is due for preventive maintenance, inspection or repair, and where the vehicle should be taken to obtain the required service.  DOS will deliver the vehicle to the designated maintenance facility as soon as possible for essential repairs (e.g., items due to manufacturer safety recall or that may cause damage to the equipment or a safety hazard for the operator or occupants) and within 10 work days of notice for non-essential service, and will retrieve the vehicle from that location upon notice from the vendor or Lessor that maintenance has been completed. The DOS will not have any repairs made to any vehicle without prior approval of the Lessor.

The Lessor will pay all fees and charges associated with vehicle towing, maintenance, repairs and inspections directly to the vendor performing the service. Lessor-designated maintenance facilities shall be within 10 miles of the Main State building, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Lessor and the COR. DOS will pay all normal operating expenses, including gasoline, oil, and tolls and parking fees.

The Lessor will provide a temporary replacement loaner vehicle, similar to the original vehicle, for any vehicle that will be out of service for maintenance or repairs for more than three consecutive business days; such loaner vehicles will be provided for the entire time period the original vehicle is out of service after the third day, and at no additional charge to the DOS.  The Lessor will provide a permanent replacement vehicle for any vehicle that will be out of service for more than ten consecutive workdays or that is out of service for breakdown repairs on more than three occasions during any twelve month period. Such permanent replacement vehicles will be provided for the remainder of the original vehicle lease period, and at no additional charge to the DOS; in these instances, the replacement vehicle shall meet the same specifications as the vehicle being replaced, unless differences in specifications are agreed upon in advance by the COR, and will be considered a continuation of the original lease for pricing purposes.

LICENSING FEES AND TAXES
Lessor shall pay all vehicle title, registration and licensing fees, charges and taxes.

LICENSE PLATES
All vehicles provided by the Lessor will be properly licensed, at the Lessor's expense, in accordance with procedures specified by the state in which the vehicle is registered.  The DOS reserves the right to replace Lessor vehicle license plates with official federal government vehicle license plates.  The DOS will ensure the security of license plates removed from Lessor vehicles and will replace the Lessor plates on the vehicle prior to return to the Lessor at the end of the lease period. 

INSURANCE
As a self-insured entity, the DOS shall be responsible for all repairs, or reimbursement for same to the Lessor, for any non-normal wear and tear or other damage sustained by the vehicle while in possession of the DOS. In the event DOS chooses to reimburse the Lessor for the cost of repairs  greater than $500, the DOS will reimburse the Lessor in an amount equal to the lesser of two commercial repair estimates, or the average of three commercial repair estimates obtained by the Lessor and provided to the COR. For repairs of $500 or less, the DOS will repair the vehicle or reimburse the Lessor based on one commercial repair estimate provided by the Lessor.  Repair or reimbursement will be at the COR's discretion.

For the purposes of this requirement, vehicles will be considered to be in the possession of the DOS from the time the DOS takes physical possession of the vehicle at the designated drop off point at the beginning of the lease period until the time the DOS delivers the vehicle to the designated drop off point at the end of the lease period, not including the time the vehicle is at a Lessor-designated maintenance/repair facility, during which time any damages to the vehicle will be addressed between the Lessor and the Lessor-designated repair facility. Drop off locations are addressed above, in the sub-paragraph entitled Delivery & Pick Up.


VEHICLE SPECIFICATIONS
Lessors will respond to DOS's request for vehicles with a description of the vehicle (e.g., make, model, year of manufacture, body style, color, odometer reading, etc.) it proposes to provide to meet the DOS's requirement.  As a minimum, all vehicles will be provided with features, equipment, safety features and accessories defined by the vehicle's manufacturer as standard.  If the Lessor chooses to provide vehicles with additional features or comfort and convenience items not specifically requested by the DOS (such as high performance engines, heavy duty alternators,  heated seats, dual zone air conditioning, remote keyless entry, alarm system, etc.), such features will be provided at no additional cost to the DOS.  If the DOS requires features beyond those defined as standard, the COR will obtain availability, delivery lead-time and itemized price surcharge information for each additional feature from the Lessor prior to submitting a formal call for the vehicle; in the event the DOS eventually orders the vehicle, the call will specify the desired additional features and the authorized surcharge amount that the Lessor may add to the basic monthly rate specified for that vehicle in the price schedule.

The Lessor will furnish to the DOS two (2) sets of vehicle keys, including remote keyless entry fobs if the vehicle is so equipped, which will be returned to the Lessor at lease termination.  The DOS will be responsible for the replacement of lost or damaged keys and remote entry fobs.

<DESC>Question 1:  The specified threat round is stated very vaguely and without regard to real world specifics, there being at least 4 different varieties of military grade 7.62 FMJ ball ammunition that all fall into the '7.62 mm ball' category and numero us varieties of armor penetrators available.  Specifically, are you soliciting a solution for 7.62 x 39, 7.62 x 51 NATO standard, 7.62 x 53R, 7.62 x 63 (.30-06 obsolete military) ammunition or other 7.62 mm type military rounds such as (obsolete) British . 303 caliber?  The same question applies to the solicitation part regarding 7.62 mm AP, since all four categories exist in AP, but further, what KIND of armor penetrator are you soliciting.  Is this mild steel, hardened carbide steel such as the APM2 NIJ st andard round, a tungsten carbide penetrator such as is found in the M-993 and Bofors AP ammunitions, or any others that should have been specified?  The same penetrator specification is requested with regard to the 12.7 mm AP solicitation and with the 14.5  mm AP solicitation with further clarification for 14.5 mm whether this requirement extends to DU (depleted uranium) core penetrators?  What is the number of survivable hits required for each of the above threats for successful completion of the solicitati on requirements, and what are the target dimensions required for the tests?  Finally, please specify the term 'service velocity' in feet or meters per second as required for the solicitation. Answer 1:  The solicitation requests that proposed technologies provide protection from 'conventional ballistic threats'. It is explained that in this context 'conventional ballistic threats' are defined as small arms rounds in the 7.62 ball to 12.7 AP mm range, with 14.5 AP as an objective for the future. An 'exact' round has intentionally not been identified because we are not interested is developing protection against a single projectile.   Rather, it is our desire to develop technologies that are effec tive against these classes of threats.   As youre aware, there are several varieties of military grade 7.62mm ball and armor piercing ammunitions.  Although, due to varying projectile mass and its associated velocity, the specific or muzzle energy associated with each projectile varies from roun d to round, the real concern between ball round impact and that of an armor piercing class projectile stems from the failure mechanism by which it defeats armor. As such, the solicitation is principally interested in systems or materials that offer AP clas s protection.   The term muzzle velocity is defined by MIL-STD 662 as 'The velocity of the projectile with respect to the muzzle at the instant the projectile leaves the weapon. This velocity is a function of the projectile weight, firing charge of the projectile, barrel characteristics, etc.' To provide a specific velocity in feet or meters per second would again defeat the intent of the solicitation by tying the request for proposal to a specific threat.   In regards to target dimensions and number of survivable hits, again these values are relevant to the proposed solution.  The response of any ballistic material is influenced by boundary conditions. Accordingly, it is anticipated that demonstration article s will be of sufficient size to adequately demonstrate the proposed ballistic solution.  Additionally, multi hit capability is typically considered favorable. However, it is not discussed in the solicitation and consequently is not a requirement. However, the offerors proposed solution will be evaluated against its merit as advancement over existing ballistic capability.  Ultimately, it is at the offeror's discretion to select what threat level their technology is effective against.   Question 2:  Is the abstract deadline Oct. 22nd?   Answer 2:  - In the General Information and Evaluation /Award Cycle Dates section: 'To be considered for the March 2008 award, the abstract cut-off date is October 22, 2007...'. Q uestion 3:  In Reference to Topic 01-2008:  As confirmation, are transparent solutions of interest to the BAA? Answer 3:  Yes, AATD is interested in the development of transparent ballistic protection technologies. Question 4:  The threats specified - Will these be evaluated at muzzle velocity or will they be reduced by a distance requirement? Answer 4:  As stated in the solicitation, 'the proposed solution system(s) should provide protection from small caliber threats&.all at service velocity&'. However, we will consider stand-off velocities versus ballistic threat, assuming the solution offers  advancement over existing ballistic capability. Question 5:  Are the evaluations single or multi-hit? Answer 5:  Multi hit capability is typically considered favorable. However, it is not discussed in the solicitation and consequently is not a requirement. However, the offerors proposed solution will be evaluated against its merit as advancement over exis ting ballistic capability. Question 6:  Can you give us the baseline areal density from which you would like to see at least the 33% weight reduction?  In other words, what do you consider the current state of art areal density?  We have experience building transparent solutions for  a variety of programs but each has a different areal density and in most cases they do not meet these higher threat levels.   Answer 6:  The baseline areal density is dependent upon the threat selected.  An 'exact' round has intentionally not been identified because we are not interested is developing protection against a single projectile.   Rather, it is our desire to develop t echnologies that are effective against a class of threats (i.e. small arms rounds in the 7.62 ball to 12.7 AP mm range with 14.5mm as an objective).   Question 7:  Are there specific areas or systems of a rotorcraft that are being targeted by this topic?  	Is the envisioned armor system to be protected by an outer skin of material or will it be exposed to the elements? Answer 7:  No specific areas of coverage are identified in the solicitation.   No specific areas of application are identified in the solicitation.  Potential offerors should address their concepts and potential applications thereof. Question 8:  To reach your 33% weight savings threshold, are you primarily looking for a structural armor system, as opposed to a parasitic armor system?  If so can you disclose the rough mechanical properties required for structural support today, or name  the material system that is providing structural support currently? Answer 8:   The solicitation does not specifically address parasitic/non-parasitic approaches intentionally.  Potential offerors should address their concepts and potential applications thereof.  Primary and secondary structure vary somewhat from aircraft to aircraft, and from aircraft generation to generation.  In general terms, aircraft structures are expected to migrate from current metals, with limited composite application, to mostly/all composite material systems over time.  Having said that, the requ irement solicited is intended to address both current and future aircraft applications, hence the solicitation identifies no specific parasitic or non-parasitic applications. Question 9:  The proposal mentions a state-of-the-art armor system as the benchmark for measured performance; can you disclose what you consider the state-of-the-art-system to be?  Are you able to provide the baseline cost, areal weight and system thicknes s of this system? Answer 9:  Current state-of-the-art systems tend to be ceramic-based (B4C, SiC, etc.) with a fiber or polymeric backing system (such as Kevlar, Spectra, Dyneema, other polymeric materials, etc.).  Protective systems intended for ball ammunition protection only may omit the ceramic strike face element typical in other systems.  Protective system areal density will vary with the specific threat(s) selected and will further vary from manufac turer to manufacturer based on their specific design approach. As discussed above, cost, areal weight, and thickness vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, and are in large part driven by the specific threat and design approach selected. Question 10:  You mention 4 projectile threats that you would like protection from; 7.62mm ball, 7.62mm AP, 12.7mm AP and 14.5mm AP.  Are you able to provide V50 velocities for each of these projectiles that would define 'protection at service velocity'? MIL-STD MIL-A-46103E 'Lightweight Composite Armor' defines protection as 2850, 2850 or 4000, 2850 and 3250 ft/sec respectively for these projectiles. Answer 10:  The solicitation requests that proposed technologies provide protection from 'conventional ballistic threats'. It is explained that in this context 'conventional ballistic threats' are defined as small arms rounds in the 7.62 ball to 12.7 AP mm  range, with 14.5 AP as an objective for the future. An 'exact' round has intentionally not been identified because we are not interested is developing protection against a single projectile.   Rather, it is our desire to develop technologies that are effe ctive against these classes of threats.   There are several varieties of military grade 7.62mm ball and armor piercing ammunitions (and 12.7mm and 14.5mm also).  Although, due to varying projectile mass and its associated velocity, the specific or muzzle energy associated with each projectile vari es from round to round, the real concern between ball round impact and that of an armor piercing class projectile stems from the failure mechanism by which it defeats armor. As such, the solicitation is principally interested in systems or materials that o ffer AP class protection.   The term muzzle velocity is defined by MIL-STD 662 as 'The velocity of the projectile with respect to the muzzle at the instant the projectile leaves the weapon. This velocity is a function of the projectile weight, firing charge of the projectile, barrel characteristics, etc.' To provide a specific velocity in feet or meters per second would defeat the intent of the solicitation by tying the solicitation to a specific threat at a specific range. Question 11:  Does the intended application require the use of curved panels or shapes or have any requirements to this nature, are flat plates sufficient for this program? Answer 11:  Potential applications for both transparent and opaque ballistic protective systems may include both flat and complex curved elements.  Having said that, proof of concept efforts could conceivably utilize flat panels only, and substantiation fo r your capability to move from flat demonstrator panels to requisite complex curved pieces.  Ultimately, it is at your discretion to select your approach. Question 12:  Does the intended application have any requirements for fire/flame resistance and/or static build up resistance? Answer 12:  Eventual specific aircraft applications could conceivably have requirements in those areas, but the solicitation identifies no specific requirements.  Your proposal would be evaluated against its merit as advancement over current state-of-the-a rt. Question 13:  Does the intended application have any multi hit or repair requirements?  Answer 13:  Multi hit and repair requirements are not included in the solicitation.  Your proposal would be evaluated against its merit as advancement over current state-of-the-art. Question 14:  Does the requirement have any other MIL-STD requirements that need to be addressed other than ballistics? Answer 14:  There are no other stated requirements at this time.
