The reference for this project is IFIB-NCSA-NCBS-07-01&02 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference.

Noncompetitive award is being made because this analyzer uses disposable cells, thus eliminating all risk of cross-contamination and carryover.  Additionally, this instrument has a large cuvette magazine with cuvette capacity for 600 tests, and can be loaded at any time, providing uninterrupted operation.  This instrument also is capable of sample dilutions up to 1:120, both pre-and post-analysis.  And it holds up to 35 reagents (thermally cooled), and up to 13 removable filter positions, thus allowing for a wide range of analytical capabilities (i.e., different wet chemistry experiments to determine different analytes of interest) to satisfy needs of multiple studies and/or projects. EST Analytical, Inc. is the only known domestic source that can supply the required items. Delivery will be FOB Destination to Menlo Park, CA. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement to the Contract Specialist by e-mail (rpaprocki@usgs.gov) no later than the response date shown in the announcement.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to award a noncompetitive purchase order to Wetlands and Water Resources, Inc. of San Rafael, CA for services in support of the CALFED Delta Regional Ecosystem Restoration Implementation Plan (DRERIP). This source has essential expertise in developing DRERIP conceptual models, knowledge of program activities, expertise in habitat restoration (including tidal habitats), and has extensive previous DRERIP experience necessary to complete the required tasks. The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement to the Contracting Officer by e-mail (rdonez@usgs.gov) no later than the response date shown in the announcement. Since the period of performance for these services starts after October 1, 2007, this is an FY08 acquisition and is currently unfunded. It will therefore be processed to point of award.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT, Per FAR 6.302-1, it is the Government's intent to award sole source contract to North Country Resources, Inc. This SUBJECT procurement will initiate facilitation, coordination and documentation services regarding the Bighorn Sheep Viability issues facing the Intermountain Region of the Forest Service. Issues to be dealt with include disease transmission between domestic sheep and bighorn sheep, the associated research literature, and how to maintain separation between the two sheep species.  Initially the work will center around the appeal decision on the FEIS for the Payette Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and the direction within that decision. The Payette is undergoing an analysis that will supplement the EIS and result in an amendment to the LRMP. Involved in the facilitated discussion are Cooperating State Agencies and Tribal Governments. Included in the discussion will be viability of bighorn sheep populations on the Payette and the effects domestic sheep grazing on the permitted allotments are having to the bighorn sheep. Also included will be discussions regarding strategies to maintain separation of the sheep species given overlap of the permitted allotments and the bighorn sheep habitat. This is not a formal solicitation. This notice constitutes the only notice. The Government encourages all interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement to submit in writing, complete information describing their ability to meet to provide said requirement. Information received as a result of this notice will be considered for the sole purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative written responses are received by 4:00p.m. (MST), July 30, 2007, a sole source contract will be awarded to North Country Resources, Inc. Detailed capabilities may be submitted to the following email address:  dbullock@fs.fed.us

<DESC>Notice of Intent The United States Department of Energy (DOE), Oak Ridge Office (ORO), plans to contract by other than full and open competition.  ORO intends to negotiate an extension to the current contract (DE-AC05-94OR21965) with Qwest Communication Federal Services, Inc. for operation, maintenance, repair, and service of the Oak Ridge Federal â€“ Integrated Communications Network (ORF-ICN) and lease of the system infrastructure equipment.  The operation and maintenance payments are scheduled through July 31, 2007, and the lease payments will be complete by September 30, 2007.  ORO plans to extend the operation, maintenance, repair, and service through October 31, 2007.  The estimated value of this contract extension is $1,800,000. A competitive solicitation for services to operate, maintain, repair, and service the ORF-ICN is expected to be issued by ORO in the near future. The use of other than full and open competition for the proposed action is authorized by 41 USE 253(c)(1).  This section provides that full and open competition need not be obtained when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of services will satisfy agency requirements. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates their firmâ€™s ability to provide an equivalent service and rationale as to why the firm should be considered as described above.  All interested firms must respond by 2:00 PM (EST), July 25, 2007, to Susan Hiser, AD-424, U. S. Department of Energy, 200 Administration Road., Oak Ridge TN 37830.  Email:  hisersg@oro.doe.gov A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No reimbursement for any costs connected with providing the capability information will be provided by DOE.

<DESC>The FAA has a requirement to upgrade existing platforms.  This upgrade will modify the existing platforms from a single point of failure architecture to a fully redundant/fault tolerant architecture.  PERFORMANCE TECHNOLOGIES is the sole manufacturer of the components that makeup the PT-AMP-5091 platform. Software for the ADAS Rehost project has been developed to work with the Performance Technologies platforms.  Procurement of a different platform would require complete re-engineering of the project software. The alternative to upgrading the existing equipment would be to procure new platforms, which would be cost prohibitive and beyond the sccope of the FAA's ADAS Rehost budget. The FAA intends to make award to Performance Technologies on a single source basis. This procurement is not available for competition.

If a firm believes it is capable of meeting the Government's requirement, it may identify their interest and capability to the buyer within fifteen (15) days of this publication.  Those interested firms must indicate whether they are a large, small-disadvantaged, 8(a), or women owned business and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned.  See Note 22.

<DESC>THIS IS A FORMAL PRESOLICITIATION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.204.  The 77th Aeronautical Systems Group, 77 AESG/PSK, Brooks City-Base, Texas, in support of the 648th Aeronautical Systems Squadron (AESS), intends to solicit and award up to two Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for System Development & Demonstration (SDD) of a Modular Aircrew Common Helmet (MACH).  Each contract will have a five year period of performance if all Options are exercised.  The objective of the MACH program is to develop, manufacture, test, field, and sustain a replacement for all currently fielded fixed winged and rotary winged aircraft flight helmets. This is intended to reduce the number of helmet configurations in the Department of Defense (DoD) inventory, reduce the logistical footprint, provide an effective platform for helmet mounted devices and increase aircrew safety.  Apart from the basic SDD effort, SDD Options for agency-specific modules will be included in each contract.  An Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) Option, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Option, Re-Procurement Package Option, and various Full Rate Production (FRP) Options will also be included in each contract.  In the event of a multiple award, the above Options will be exercised with a single SDD contractor after a downselect process.  Best Estimated Quantities (BEQs) are provided for the following:  IOT&E Articles (180 ea), LRIP Units (260 ea), FRP MACH Units (24,000 ea), FRP AH-64 Module Interfaces (500 ea), FRP JHMCS Module Interfaces (600 ea) and FRP Maxillofacial Shields (4,000 ea).  Requirements will be provided in a Government Performance Specification, Statement of Objectives (SOO), Contractor Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs), and final solicitation.  The application of Full Tradeoff source selection procedures will be utilized pursuant to AFFARS 5315.3 in the best value determination.

<DESC>NASA, John C. Stennis Space Center has a requirement for repair and corrosion remediation of the high pressure industrial water (HPIW) piping system.  This pre-solicitation notice is also an invitation to Industry Day for the HPIW piping system. NASA’s John C. Stennis Space Center has over 7500 feet of underground piping supplying high pressure industrial water to its rocket engine test stands.  This system was fabricated from grade 60 carbon steel, has been in service for over 40 years and has various degrees of general and microbial internal corrosion.  It is desired to extend the useful life of the system for an additional 40 years. The HPIW facility furnishes non-potable water to the “A” Test Complex (212,000 gal/min) and “B” Test Complex (290,000 gal/min) for test stand deflector coolant, fire protection (deluge), and diffuser operation.  Operating pressure at rated flow is 225 psig.  Pipe diameters range from 66 to 75 inches for the “A” Test Complex and 96 inches for the “B” Test Complex.  HPIW flow operation times vary with test activity, currently about 50 hours per year, and are expected to increase significantly over the next 10 years.  The system is nominally left pressurized 150 psig to provide deluge water for emergency conditions on the test stands served. The system may be partially dewatered via isolation valves for short intervals for maintenance and inspection activities.   It is critical that any treatment or repair materials be well adhered to the existing piping as the system has very small cooling passages at the test stand flame buckets.  Any large scale material loss that blocks flow could result in facility damage costing millions of dollars along with long periods of inability to test, resulting in unacceptable impacts to the NASA mission.   NASA/SSC contemplates making future internal repairs to the most severely corroded areas and is interested in identifying available technologies to accomplish these repairs with minimum facility outages.  All the piping is underground and certification of confined space entry training will be required for this activity.  System access is limited to a few points in the system.  In order to mitigate risks, NASA/SSC may implement limited scale pilot projects to test efficacy of various technologies before implementing a full scale repair. Project funding is not expected to be available before Fiscal Year 2008. This synopsis should not be construed as a formal request for proposals but, rather a pre-solicitation synopsis requesting information under the authority of FAR 15.201.  Responses to this synopsis cannot be accepted by NASA to form a binding contract. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.	 NASA desires that those companies expressing an interest in the aforementioned synopsis provide a Statement of Capability (SOC) that addresses high-level alternatives; general, market-based approaches; experience in this area; knowledge of the work involved; and plant, professional and manufacturing resources. The SOC should also contain delivery lead times for components and any recommended government furnished equipment.  Respondents to this notice will not be notified of evaluation results.	The SOC should not include confidential business or financial information relating to specific companies.  An industry day is planned for August 14, 2007 so interested and qualified companies may visit the site and discuss any aspects of this synopsis.     For safety reasons, entry into the piping system will not be allowed.  A limit of two individuals from any company qualified on the basis of their submitted Statement of Capabilities may participate in the industry day.  The site location is John C. Stennis Space Center, Stennis Space Center, MS 39529.   The tour will begin at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, August 14, 2007 at the Visitor Control Center located at the South Entrance.  All attendees are encouraged to arrive 30 minutes early at the specified site for security processing.	A bus and escorts will be provided for access to the test complex.  If your firm plans on attending the site tour, you must submit an electronic notification including the names and country of citizenship of attending company representatives to Judith.a.bruscino@nasa.gov.  Primary point of contact for the site visit is Judy Bruscino, Contracting Officer, Code BA33, (228) 688-3681, John C. Stennis Space Center, Stennis Space Center, MS 39529.  Notifications of attendance must be received by August 10, 2007 with your Statement of Capability.   Statements of Capability must be submitted to Judith.a.bruscino@nasa.gov and received at Stennis Space Center no later than August 10, 2007 at 3:00 PM local time. Faxed correspondence and telephone correspondence will not be accepted.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps has a requirement to procure contractor support services to provide shallow water and underwater egress training using the Modular Amphibious Egress Trainer (MAET) and Shallow Water Egress Trainer (SWET).   The Government intends to pursue this effort as a full and open commercial competition procurement, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with Options pursuant to FAR 2.1, which provides the standard definition of commercial items/services.  Standard practices for “Acquisition of Commercial Items”, as set forth at FAR 12.203, will be applied throughout the process.  The RFP is expected to be issued on 3 August 2007.  The MAET is an underwater escape trainer with a generic fuselage section representing specific aircraft/amphibious vessels cockpit and cabin emergency escape exits.  The MAET functions closely to the general characteristics of a ditched aircraft; in this case either the CH-46 or CH-53. The fuselage is capable of being lowered in!  to a pool provided by the government.  After entry into the water in a horizontal position with the fuselage upright, the fuselage will be capable of rotation about its longitudinal axis.  The control unit will provide two-speed rate of descent and retract.  The students will be able to practice escaping the trainer with the fuselage floating in an upright position, an inverted position or any position between upright and inverted.  Currently there are three permanent sites where MAETs are located: Camp Hansen, Okinawa, Japan (MWR Pool), Marine Corps Base Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii (Base Pool), Camp Pendleton, California (Camp Horno Pool).  Additionally, the Shallow Water (SWET) and IP/HABD training course is operational at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  All questions, concerns, and information should be addressed to or mailed to Graham K. Oliff Jr. at: Marine Corps Systems Command PMTRASYS 12350 Research Parkway Orlando, FL 32826-3275. No phone calls will be accepted.  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUCTED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Government intends to purchase, on a sole source basis in accord with FAR 6.302-1, perpetual right-to-use licenses and updates to systems engineering software, proprietary to Vitech Corporation, 2070 Chain Bridge Rd Ste 320 Vienna VA 22182-2536.  The requirement includes the following:  (1) licenses and software, quantity 5 each, to CORE 5.1 Systems Engineering Tool Suite/Workstation software, part number WS-50-100; (2) licenses and software, quantity 5 each, to COREsim Workstation Add-on, part number WS-50-110; (3) subscriptions to software updates, term of the subscription to be date of software delivery through 30 September 2007, quantity 5 each, to CORE Workstation, part number MN-00-100; (4) subscriptions to software updates, term of the subscription to be date of software delivery through 30 September 2007, quantity 5 each, to COREsim Workstation Add-on,  part number MN-00-110; (5) subscriptions to software updates, term of the subscription to be 1 June 2007 throug!  h 30 September 2007, quantity 4 each, to CORE Workstation, part number MN-00-100;  and (6) subscriptions to software updates, term of the subscription to be 1 June 2007 through 30 September 2007, quantity 4 each, to COREsim Workstation Add-on, part number MN-00-110.  Software shall be delivered electronically FOB Destination to NSWCDD within 7 business days after award of order/contract.   No other software will satisfy this requirement at this time due to interoperability requirements with current work in progress created using the previous version of CORE.  There are also training and other infrastructure considerations. Systems Engineering tools are complex, and require trained users to be effective.  CORE is widely used at NSWCDD, and is taught by the educational institutions that provide advanced education in Systems Engineering for the NSWCDD workforce.  CORE is approved for use on the NMCI network, and is one of the few known Systems Engineering tools that meets all of the capability requirements for multiple work efforts, which include (1) requirements management, (2) integrated, executable architecture development, to include specifications for all of the DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) views, (3) mission decomposition analysis, and (4) integrated document and configuration management.  CORE is extremely flexible and extensible, which allows it to !  be adapted for a variety of different analyses.  Continued use of CORE will allow for current work to continue without interruption for retraining or for conversion of previous CORE files to some other application.  Consideration may be given to competitive software for possible future use, particularly for Systems Engineering tools that are well-established within the DoD acquisition community and are supported with appropriate training. The Government will consider statements for the immediate requirement, from all responsible sources, which clearly evidence capability to provide the required proprietary items within the required delivery schedule.  Capability statements must be submitted via email to DLGR_NSWC_XDS13@navy.mil, must be received NLT 7 days after publication date of this notice, and must reference Quotation Number N00178-07-Q-3038.  All responsible sources may submit a quote, however, quotations that are not accompanied by a capability statement that evidences the ability to deliver the items specified herein will not be considered for award.  Award is to be made under Simplified Acquisition (FAR Part 13) and Commercial Items (FAR Part 12) Procedures.  The Government will not issue a written solicitation as all items are specified in this notice.  Closing time and date is 2:00 pm ET on 25 July 2007.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing (PHONE CALLS ARE NOT ACCEPTED) to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on  July 23, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

3.     FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.     Addendum:     Basis for Award:     The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Price and technical capability of the offeror to meet the Government requirements.     The Government will determine technical capabilitiy by visiting the Offerors facilities and completing the attached Facility Inspection checklist. All items on the checklist must meet the standard as listed in the performance work statement in order for the offeror to be determined technically acceptable.  The Government will award to the lowest price technically acceptable offeror.   Price will be evaluated using the total estimated price of all five years.  Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated.     An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.     Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will not be considered and will be ineligible for award. 

4.     The evaluation process will proceed as follows:     (a) Technical Acceptance:     By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the terms, conditions, performance work statement, and all other requirements of this solicitation and subsequent agreement, and will be determined technically acceptable as identified in paragraph 3 above.     Any exception taken to the terms, conditions, or requirements will result in a determination of technical unacceptability; (b) Price:     Price will be evaluated as identified in paragraph 3 above.  In addition price reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, if applicable.     Price realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished.   
5.     The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to be technically unacceptable.   The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.     Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.     The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Pfeiffer Vacuum in Nashua, New Hampshire for the purchase of an Magnetic Turbo Pump System with Pressure Measurement System and Residual Gas Analyzer under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

NIST requires one Pfeiffer Magnetic Turbo Pump System with Pressure Measurement System and Residual Gas Analyzer.  The required system shall meet the following specifications:

Turbo Pump:
1.	shall have a pumping speed of 180 liters/sec for nitrogen and 105 liters/sec for hydrogen;
2.	shall have a compression ratio greater than or equal to 1 x 10E10 for nitrogen and greater than or equal to 5 x 10E5 for hydrogen;
3.	shall be magnetically levitated with a magnetic bearing system;
4.	shall have an ultimate pressure less than 5 x 10E 10 mbar;
5.	shall have both air and water cooling options;
6.	shall have a 6 inch OD CF flange pump port;
7.	shall be able to operate from an existing Pfeiffer Vacuum TCM 1601 bearing controller.

Dry Pump:
1.	shall have an ultimate pressure less than 0.1 mbar;
2.	pumping speed shall be greater than 7.0 meter cubed per hour;
3.	shall have an oil free pump chamber and contain no oil in the entire pump body;
4.	pump port shall be a DN25 ISO KF flange.

Gauge:
1.	shall be a cold cathode gauge mounted on a DN 40 CF flange;
2.	shall be able to operate from 5 x 1 E 3 mbar to 1 x 10E 11 mbar;
3.	shall be bakeable to 250 degrees Celsius;
4.	shall be ultra high vacuum compatible;
5.	shall be able to operate from an existing Pfeiffer Vacuum TPG 300 pressure measurement controller;
6.	pressure measurement controller shall allow for the operation of two cold cathode gauges.

Residual Gas Analyzer (RGA):
1.	shall be able to measure up to 100 amu;
2.	shall have a channeltron electron multiplier;
3.	shall be bakeable to 200 degrees Celsius;
4.	shall operate from an existing Pfeiffer Vacuum Prisma RGA control unit;
5.	shall mount on a DN40 CF flange;
6.	shall achieve a sensitivity of 1 x 10E 14 mbar with the channeltron detector, and 5 x 10E 12 mbar with a faraday detector.
	 

Sole source determination is based on the need for a Magnetic Turbo Pump System with Pressure Measurement System and Residual Gas Analyzer that is compatible with NISTs existing stock of Pfeiffer vacuum equipment.  NIST requires the turbo pump system to be compatible with its existing stock of Pfeiffer vacuum pumps, so that the pumps, controllers, and spare parts can be interchanged if a pump or controller fails to keep vacuum integrity in critical experiments.  In addition, NIST requires that the pressure measurement items be compatible with its existing stock so that these can be interchanged in case of failure, and also make use of the same stock of spare parts, cables, and control software that NIST develops.  NIST requires that the residual gas analyzer be able to be operated using its existing Pfeiffer residual gas analyzer controller and software, so that it only has to invest in one existing controller unit, which can control multiple gas analyzer heads.  Since only Pfeiffer Vacuum can meet requirements, NIST requires this order to be sole sourced to Pfeiffer Vacuum.  
 		
Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 339111, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on August 1, 2007.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Mettler Toledo in Columbus, Ohio for the purchase of Load Cells under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

NIST requires one set of four units of Load Cells, which will be used for both laboratory and field experiments.  The Large Fire Laboratory (LFL) seeks to expand the LFL capabilities and develop new field measuring capabilities, while maintaining both forward and back compatibility. Specifically, NIST requires the new equipment to work with the existing LFL Mettler Toledo components in order to improve laboratory capabilities, with interchangeability and compatibility between NISTs existing laboratory equipment and the new field equipment. The systems shall be completely self contained and capable of measuring mass loss, capable of recording the data, and shall be completely self-powered.  In addition, the required systems shall meet the following specifications:

1.	Four (4) independent, identical load cell/data collection units;
2.	Each unit shall consist of a base plate, water tight enclosure to house the data acquisition and power supply, and enclosure to house the load cell;
3.	Operating temperature range:  0F to 150F;
4.	Data acquisition enclosure shall be watertight and top opening;
5.	Load cell enclosure shall have a 3 inch opening above the load cell to allow load to be transferred to load cell;
6.	Maximum weight per unit:  1250 lbs.;
a.	500 lbs. dead weight
b.	750 lbs. sample weight
7.	Resolution one (1) lb.
8.	Self-contained data acquisition system per unit:
a.	data collection of load cell signal and two (2) type K thermocouples
b.	Storage media:  memory stick, SD card
c.	Sampling rate:  one (1) second
d.	Maximum run time:  five (5) hours
e.	Auto shut-off after 5 hours
9.	Self contained power source with maximum run time of five (5) hours;
10.	Two (2) type K thermocouples to monitor enclosure and load cell temperature;
11.	Waterproof NEMA 4X type enclosure;
12.	Shall be compatible with NISTs existing Large Fire Laboratory Mettler Toledo Centerline Load Cells.

Sole source determination is based on NISTs need for Load Cell equipment (load cells, data control/processing, and display units) that is compatible and interchangeable with its existing Mettler Toledo Load Cell equipment (load cells, data control/processing, and display units).  Compatibility is required so that Load Cells and parts can be interchanged with NISTs existing Mettler Toledo Load Cells and parts during laboratory and field experiments. Since only Mettler Toledo can provide Load Cells that are compatible and interchangeable with NISTs existing Load Cells, and due to proprietary hardware and software interfacing issues, we require this order to be sole sourced to Mettler Toledo.  
 		
Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 339111, and the size standard is 500 employees.

<SUBJECT>A -- EFG Sapphire Sheets for Large Aperture EO/IR Windows

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA) FOR EFG Sapphire Sheets for Large Aperture EO/IR Windows.  The purpose of this NOCA is not to request competitive proposals.  The Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) is contemplating the award of a cost-reimbursement type contract to Saint-Gobain Crystals, 33 Powers Street, Milford, NH 03055 for the program entitled "EFG Sapphire Sheets for Large Aperture EO/IR Windows" under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source."  The objective of this acquisition shall be to improve the manufacturing processes associated with the production of Edge-defined Film-fed Growth (EFG) sapphire in order to achieve the domestic capability of producing larger window sizes, with increased affordability.  This acquisition is being contemplated to enable the production of large (at least 32 inches x 32 inches x 0.8 inch) sapphire sheets.  Windows of this size would be extremely useful for multiple airborne and ground-based platforms with large sensor suites which need to be protected from harsh operating conditions over many years of service.  Exhibiting broadband transmission from the ultraviolet through the visible and mid-infrared wavelengths, as well as being an extremely hard, durable, scratch-resistant material, sapphire is an excellent candidate for the electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) window application.  However, the use of sapphire windows is currently limited by the size that can be produced and by their cost.  Even though sapphire crystals grown by the EFG process are the largest in the world, windows made of EFG sapphire are currently only available with finished sheet sizes up to 9 inches x 26 inches or 12 inches x 20 inches.  There are current Air Force activities which would use sapphire windows, if they were available in the required size (at least 32 inches x 32 inches x 0.8 inch).  The period of performance for the Phase I procurement is anticipated to be 20 months.  The Phase I tasks are to:  identify the factors (manufacturing, cost, and technology drivers) limiting the ability to manufacture large (at least 32 inches x 32 inches x 0.8 inch, finished dimensions) monolithic EFG sapphire EO/IR windows; identify the risks associated with the limiting factors; prioritize the factors; formulate a manufacturing plan to mitigate the identified drivers, addressing process optimization and yield improvement to reduce cost; and implement and demonstrate a limited number of manufacturing processes focusing on the critical path, based on available funding.  Additional phases to further improve the manufacturing processes associated with producing large EFG sapphire, and to increase the size produced, may be undertaken depending on the progress made and the availability of funding.  The ability of the offeror to scale up production and accomplish the related goals of this program will be assessed based on the existing demonstrated ability of the offeror to routinely produce EFG sapphire that exhibits a high degree of optical transparency in the visible through mid-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, along with very good index-of-refraction homogeneity, in the size range of 12 inches x 20 inches.  Transmittance greater than 80 percent, over the wavelength region from 0.4 - 4 microns, is required for quarter-inch-thick samples.  Variation in the index of refraction on the order of 6 ppm or less, over the entire window, is also required.  It is planned that the initial sole source contract will be awarded for $1,799,821.00 with the potential for future phases that will increase the total estimated amount to $9.8M.  Inquiries pertaining to this acquisition should be addressed to Timothy J. Wisecup, Contracting Officer, telephone: (937) 656-9887, facsimile: (937) 255-5302, e-mail:  timothy.wisecup@wpafb.af.mil, or Jimmie L.

<DESC>The Veteran's Affairs - I.T. Acquisition Center has a requirement for a software license agreement for Norton McAfee Anti-Virus and Anti-Spy ware and Anti-Spam protection, software for a period of one base year, with one option year.  The software is currently deployed throughout the VA Infrastructure. To install another type of license, new hardware will be required as well as testing to determine viability on the VA network before deployment is started. The criticality of the architecture makes it necessary to test all major applications before deployment begins. Some sites will require as long as three to six months time frame for testing of new applications. The VA is almost at the end-of-life cycle for the Anti-virus, Anti-spy, Anti-spam protection to effectively secure the VA network.  New hardware would be cost prohibitive. The new licensing is required on or before 08/31/2007. McAfee software is designed to control viruses and spam on the second largest network in the federal government. The estimated value of purchasing the software licensing agreement was estimated at $1,933,960.00.  This action is to justify the use of a Brand Name Description as described in FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description. McAfee licenses can be purchased from a number of agent contractors at a variety of prices. This product will be solicited utilizing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Scientific and Engineering Workstation Procurement (SEWP) IV contracting system as specified by VA directive. Responses to this notice must be in writing and must be received by 12:00 pm CST on July 11, 2007. Third party firms will be considered only if responding with clear and convincing evidence that the Government will avoid additional cost of ownership and production will not be affected if non-McAfee software is purchased. The determination to open brand name competition based on responses is solely within the discretion of the Government. No additional synopsis information will be published, and a solicitation will only be issued to SEWP IV contract holders, regardless of the Government's brand name decision. Responses should be emailed to Allison.Cox-Rudick@va.gov or faxed to 512-326-6028.

Replace existing relay-based  system with solid-state controls, refinish cab interiors and additional work in accordance  with the drawings and specifications to be provided with the RFP.  Contractor shall also refurbish the individual cars and car controls to meet current code requirements, and  upgrade the lighting and interior finishes.  Work includes general construction, alterations, mechanical and electrical work, elevators and necessary removal of existing structures  and construction and certain other items.  It is critical that the contractor for this job provide a state of the art control system  that will serve this facility for the next 30 years.  The existing system was installed  in 1949 and overhauled in 1991.

The time required to complete each elevator must be minimized to insure  that patient care is not compromised. These systems will result in greater than normal challenges to retrofit modern controls.   Contractor shall have experience not only in retrofitting controls, but also in maintenance  of older systems. Estimated price range for this acquisition is between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000.   Estimated period of performance for this acquisition is 435 calendar days after issuance  of Notice To Proceed (NTP).  It shall be finalized in the RFP.   This acquisition shall be conducted and award shall be made on a full, open,  and unrestricted basis.

Award shall be made to the Offeror whose Offer, after price proposal and technical proposal are evaluated by the Government, demonstrates and represents best value to the Government.  Solicitation shall be issued and Award shall be made pursuant to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This will provide enhanced situational awareness and communication capabilities for the Current Force through technology insertio ns into Abrams, Bradley and HMMWV.  This initial award, targeted for 2QFY08, will provide for acquisition of Long Lead Items, facilitization, and tooling. Spin Out 1 consists of the following items: Ground Mobile Radio (GMR), Integrated Computer System (IC S) Type VI, the System of Systems Common Operating  Environment (SoSCOE), Battle Command (BC) software, Network Management System (NMS) software, and Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) both Urban and Tactical variants.

SCOPE OF WORK:  This project renovates the interior and installs fire  suppression that doesn’t currently exist.  It includes complete  replacement of the HVAC and electrical systems.  The fire alarm is so  outdated it cannot be repaired and requires replacement.  The requirement  for fire suppression/detection carries an FSD 3.  The renovation will  correct life safety deficiencies such as a conference room with inadequate  egress.  The project will reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient  use of space. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: No fire suppression currently exists and  fire alarms are unreliable.  Work is necessary to bring the Wing  Headquarters building into compliance with Life Safety Code, Handicapped  Access and to reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient use of space.  HVAC and electrical systems require revitalization due to age and addition  of ADP equipment.  HVAC has failed on several occasions requiring  temporary heaters and A/C to be brought in until repairs could be made.  The system has been repaired several times but is not expected to be  reliable in the future.  The mechanical system will remain in operation to  serve the first floor.  The first floor will remain occupied by the Wing  Command Section and ASC/JA during construction.  This will require the  contractor to provide temporary rigging for the demolition and material  delivery.  All first floor accesses will have to be maintained during the  construction.  There will be numerous occasions where the contractor will  need to stop performing work to accommodate special events and  distinguished visitors. NOTES: 1. The solicitation, specifications and drawings will be available  on the World Wide Web on or about 22 June 2007, at  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. 2.

The Government intends to award a minimum of two IDIQ contracts of which one may potentially be awarded to a successful HUBZone or SDVOSB firm.  

The primary NAICS Code is 236220 and the corresponding size standard is $31.0M average annual receipts over the last 3 fiscal years.

Infrastructure is defined as 1) residential building construction for single family and/or multi-family housing; 2) nonresidential building construction for industrial buildings and warehouses; 3) nonresidential buildings, other than industrial buildings and warehouses; and 4) supporting improvements such as utilities, landscaping, and roadways.  The areas of consideration will include, but not be limited to, Navy, Marine Corps, and miscellaneous Federal and other facilities.

The total estimated value for all contracts inclusive of options will not exceed $100,000,000.  The minimum and maximum order limitation will be established at $3,000,000 and $10,000,000, respectively.  A minimum guarantee of $10,000 will be awarded on each contract for the base period only.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to RFQ-TX-07-00058 is to provide answers to questions.

Questions on Behaviors:
 
1. Talk Straight -  Does that mean effective communication i.e., say what you mean,  mean what you say?

Effective communication means say what you mean, mean what you say and being consistent with your communication.

2. Create transparency - Is that transparency with management to employee and employee to management or both?

Transparency in the relationship what is expected from an employee and what an employee expects from his boss. 

3. Get Better- Clarification on get better.  Does that mean emotionally, relationships, productivity, or all of the above?

We are considering a bid on the Coaching RFQ.  Questions...
 
- travel expenses...should they be included as turn key for all items or will there be a separate allotment for travel?  

EPA will not pay for travel expenses. We desire a local contractor for the coaching.

- will EPA consider alternative delivery for coaching that would allow for telephonic communication in lieu of live meetings and the associated travel?

EPA Statement of Work states that the majority of the coaching will be done in person unless the client request his/her coaching by teleconference.
 
EPA will not pay for travel expenses for this contract.   

1)  Is there one group coaching session for "2" Hours or multiple
expected during the year?

One-on-one coaching is one hour and group coaching sessions can range from 1-4 hours.

2)  Items six thru ten show 10/01/2008 thru 9/30/2009 as the term.  Is
this a typo or is this a two-year project?

This contract is a two year contract that will expire on September 30, 2009.  This contract can be extended beyond 2009 for one year if EPA wishes to continue the contract.  In that case the contract will expire in 2010 if the option is executed.

3) Is there one brown bag lunch session or multiple?  It looks as though
EPA is providing books to ALL managers and supervisors therefore, are
there multiple sessions?    Who chooses the book?

The brown bag sessions will be determined by senior staff.  The brown bag lunch sessions can range from anywhere to 3-12 times per year.  EPA will provide the books and the books will be chosen in consultation with EPA's senior management and the executive coach.  

4)  Does the EPA have a theme around this development offering? 

 There is no central theme around this contract, although our goal is to provide our senior managers with good leadership and management tools.

1. Will the ALL handouts, videos, materials, etc. be provided by the EPA
for the one-on-one coaching, group sessions, day training and retreats, faculty,
presenations and meetings, or will the contractor have to provide ALL handouts, 
videos, materials, etc for the one-on-one coaching, group sessions, day training
retreats, faculty, presentations and meetings.
The contractor will be responsible for providing All handouts, videos, materials  for one-on-one coaching, day training retreats, faculty, presentations and meetings 
2. Can you give more of a timetable as to what exact date the
coaching will begin, and the hours in which the coaching will take place.
Or will the time and date for coaching, day training/retreat, presentations and 
meetings be determined by the EPA and contractor.
We would like to start the Executive Coaching Sessions in August or September 2007.  Coaching sessions usually run about a hour per person and retreats are usually range from 6- 8 hours per day.  Group Presentations range from 1-2 hours.  The time and date for coaching will be determined by each Executive Manager.
3. Can you clarify the an area in the services requested? For the one-on-one
Executive Coaching, is the coaching session to discover personal
leadership characteristics through self-analysis coupled with feedback provided 
by EPA automated 360 instrument and to create a safe sounding board to: (a) outline
and test strategies to improve managerial/supervisory skills/abilities; (b) analyze
feedback results via possible perception/mis-perceptions;(c) encourage
acceptance of different approaches to leadership and enable client to match leadership
approaches to organizational needs?
Executive Coaching will be used by Executive Managers for self improvement in the areas of Leadership  and Management.  EPA's in house 360 has identified areas for management improvement.  The managers are in the process of preparing Action Plans and having a coach will be very helpful in preparing for this task. 
4. What is the automated 360 instrument ?
EPA's in house 360 instrument that is tied to the Region's  Core Values (STOCKCAR - Service, Taking Initiative, Open Communication, Commitment & Vision, Knowledge, Character, Accountability and Risk Taking).

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the viability of wastewater collection and treatment facilities in the city of Dakar.  

Economic development and growth in Senegal has not always considered environmental issues in planning and implementation.  Urbanization and industrialization has contributed significantly to the scale of pollution in the country, particularly in urban areas such as Dakar.  Like many other countries in the region, considerable catch-up is required before public infrastructure elements such as water supply, sewerage and storm drainage are capable of supporting economic and urban growth, reducing poverty and enabling sustainable development.

In March 2005, the Government of Senegal (GoS) published a Sectoral Policy Letter for Urban and Rural Water and Sanitation. The intent of this publication was to document the progress that had been made in Senegal in achieving the objectives for poverty reduction associated with the Millennium Development Goals - the UN blueprint for poverty reduction by 2015.  Through its sectoral policy letter, the GoS has identified that the urban sanitation sector within the country faces a number of significant constraints. This includes the fact that the number of households that have access to proper sanitation facilities is significantly less than those that have access to water supply.  

To improve the urban sanitation situation, the GoS has given this sector a high priority, and established a strategy which has four main elements, namely: 
-The development of effective organizational and institutional frameworks for both water supply and sanitation services;
-The reinforcement of its existing technical infrastructure as a result of increasing demand, a need to improve the quality of service, and the need to expand services to accommodate the growing population and geographical spread of the city;
-The need to improve the financial balance by which expenditures associated with effective service will be offset by sufficient revenues to make those enhanced services sustainable;
-The need to focus targeted actions on the reduction of poverty associated with the Millennium Development Goals.

ONAS (the agency responsible for managing urban sanitation and operating the public sewer network within the country) has proposed a rehabilitation of the wastewater collection network that serves an older portion of Dakar (Corniche West).  Currently, this wastewater is discharged into the ocean, with no treatment, about 200 yards from shore. In conjunction with rehabilitation of the collection pipes and evaluating the collection system, ONAS has plans for construction of a 10 to 20 million gallons per day treatment plant and a longer outfall pipe (the "Project"). This Feasibility Study would consider the technical and economic implications of both aspects of the Project.

The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID), National Center for Zoonotic, Vectorborne, and Enteric  Diseases (NCZVED), Division of Parasitic Diseases is seeking to award a sole source commercial contract for investigation in California of an unexplained dermopathy (Skin Condition) which some refer to as  Morgellons. The Government has determined that Kaiser Permanente (KP), Northern California is the only responsible source to meet the Government's needs. Morgellons is a rare condition with a heavy concentration in California, and KP is the only organization that has the location, coverage area, and membership size to provide the large sample size required for the study. Minimum managed care organization  membership required to satisfy this study is 25% of the population in the region selected. Other minimum vendor qualifications for this requirement are: electronic health records that have been implemented in the organization at least since January 2006; ability to conduct electronic queries of medical records, including progress notes, to identify clinical conditions and complaints; health maintenance organization with at least 3 million enrollees and coverage of at least 25% of the population in the chosen geographic area; location in a geographic area with a large number of suspected cases; experience in conducting clinical and epidemiologic studies; adequate qualified personnel to successfully perform the requested services by the date required. The proposed effort will involve the following: describing the clinical and epidemiologic features of persons who have reported themselves as having this unexplained skin condition, including assessing the frequency of co-morbid conditions (e.g., neurocognitive deficits, neurologic conditions, major psychiatric disorders); collecting information to generate hypotheses about possible risk factors for this condition; collecting skin biopsies to assess the histopathologic features of the skin condition ; obtaining fibers or threads from patients with the condition to determine their potential etiology; describing the geographic distribution of this condition;  estimating rates of illness in the population; and describing health care utilization among persons with the condition. Total period of performance will be seven (9) months from date of award. The Government intends to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) on 31 July 2007, with award anticipated by 31 August 2007. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; there is no solicitation available at this time.  No response will be provided for requests for a solicitation.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. 

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks potential sources for the development of an automated system for Radiological Sample Analysis to create unique spectral ?fingerprints? for material(s) that have the potential to be used in Improvised Nuclear Devices (IND) and Radiological Dispersion Devices (RDD). The goal of the automated system is to use analytical techniques in a closed-loop system to analyze samples (field and/or fixed laboratories) in hours, rather than days. The system will aid in the Nuclear Forensics Attribution Program. 

The system will perform total dissolution of the sample, chemical / radiochemical separation, and isotope analysis in last than 24 hours. The system must be able to communicate with Technical Reachback Support Directorate.  The Technical Reachback Support Directorate serves as the primary point of contact for situational awareness through the Joint Analysis Center and the Nuclear Assessment Program.
 

The system should be inherently simple to operate, survivable, durable, multi-functional and easily transportable by air and truck. As part of its survivability, the system needs to be able to operate in a radiological contaminated area with reasonable protection and able to be decontaminated. 

Sources sought responses shall reflect corporate information and a capability summary reflecting experience related to the above areas.  Responses are to be limited to no more than five pages.  Company information should include qualifications and experience in work of this nature, point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, CAGE code, DUNS Number, business size, and small business classification (8(a), HUBZone, etc.), if applicable.

<CONTACT>Allison Cox-Rudick Contract Specialist (512) 326-6148
<DESC>The Veteran's Affairs - I.T. Acquisition Center has a requirement for a software license agreement for  McAfee Anti-Virus and Anti-Spy ware and Anti-Spam protection, software for a period of one base year, with one option year.  The software is currently deployed throughout the VA Infrastructure. To install another type of license, new hardware will be required as well as testing to determine viability on the VA network before deployment is started. The criticality of the architecture makes it necessary to test all major applications before deployment begins. Some sites will require as long as three to six months time frame for testing of new applications. The VA is almost at the end-of-life cycle for the Anti-virus, Anti-spy, Anti-spam protection to effectively secure the VA network.  New hardware would be cost prohibitive. The new licensing is required on or before 08/31/2007. McAfee software is designed to control viruses and spam on the second largest network in the federal government. The estimated value of purchasing the software licensing agreement was estimated at $1,933,960.00.  This action is to justify the use of a Brand Name Description as described in FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description. McAfee licenses can be purchased from a number of agent contractors at a variety of prices. This product will be solicited utilizing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Scientific and Engineering Workstation Procurement (SEWP) IV contracting system as specified by VA directive. Responses to this notice must be in writing and must be received by 12:00 pm CST on July 11, 2007. Third party firms will be considered only if responding with clear and convincing evidence that the Government will avoid additional cost of ownership and production will not be affected if non-McAfee software is purchased. The determination to open brand name competition based on responses is solely within the discretion of the Government. No additional synopsis information will be published, and a solicitation will only be issued to SEWP IV contract holders, regardless of the Government's brand name decision. Responses should be emailed to Allison.Cox-Rudick@va.gov or faxed to 512-326-6028.

<DESC>The reason for this amendment is to correct the weights listed in the pre-solicitation for the robotic system.  The new weights are as follows.  A robotic system platform that weighs 50 pounds or less, and an OCU that weighs 20 pounds or less. The CLASS CODE identified in the initial pre-solicitation was identified as 10 weapons which is not appropriate for this acquisition.  The proper CLASS CODE is 13 Ammunition and Explosives.  This CLASS CODE also encompasses EOD detection equipment.   In addition, here is a link that can be utilized to download the attachments referenced in this posting.  Please copy it into the address field on your internet explorer tool and it will take you to the PEO STRI business opportunities module.  Click on the  PEO STRI solicitations section in the middle of the page.

The BAA selection process will be conducted in two (2) phases.  The package describes the full process for submission and evaluation as well as specific requirements for the mission areas.  Potential Offerors are encouraged to download the BAA package from the website as of the date of this synopsis.  Direct any questions regarding this BAA to the POC listed above.

<DESC>REVISED SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR NEPA ACQUISITION The US Department of Energy seeks qualified small businesses, small  business-led teams and joint ventures that qualify as small businesses  capable of preparing Environmental Impact Statements (EIS), Environmental  Assessments (EA), Environmental Reports (ER), and supporting environmental  documentation. During the next five years DOE headquarters program and  field offices nationwide, including the National Nuclear Security  Administration (NNSA) and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and  their offices will require contractor support services for the preparation  of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs), Environmental Assessments (EAs)  and related documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act  (NEPA), environmental reports (ERs) and other documentation required by  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in its review of license  applications, and environmental documentation required by other State and  Federal regulators.  DOE plans to issue multiple-award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity  contracts for the preparation of EISs, EAs, ERs, and other supporting  documentation Work may be performed at any of the DOE, NNSA, and FERC  sites and programs nationwide. The target date for contract award is  January 2008. The total term of the contracts will be five years. Specific  EIS, EA, ER, and supporting documentation preparation to be performed  under this acquisition will be issued on individual task orders from any  DOE, NNSA, and FERC program or site office. Information on current NEPA  contracts can be found at http://www.eh.doe.gov/nepa/contracting.html .  Technical Requirements Contractors must be capable of supporting preparation of multiple NEPA or  related documents and addressing DOE facilities in several widely  separated locations simultaneously. The contractor will be required to  supply expertise in such fields as chemical engineering, nuclear  engineering, health physics, groundwater modeling, accident analysis,  radiological issues, transportation analysis, and air quality modeling, in  addition to environmental specialties such as ecology, wetlands  management, endangered species management, and cultural resources.  Examples of actions DOE has evaluated in its NEPA documents include but  are not limited to nuclear stockpile management; spent nuclear fuel  management; tritium production and extraction; transportation, treatment,  storage, and disposal of radioactive and hazardous materials and waste;  decommissioning, decontamination, and disposal of nuclear and support  facilities; site-wide multi-program analyses of DOE sites; construction  and operation of laboratory facilities, including biohazard facilities;  electrical power transmission line siting and operation; re-licensing of  hydroelectric facilities, permitting of interstate natural gas pipelines;  clean coal projects; management of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve;  fisheries and wildlife management; wetland replacement and impact  mitigation projects; and power marketing actions. In addition, under the  Energy Policy Act of 2005 DOE anticipates the need for NEPA support  services for reviews of energy conservation initiatives and power  generation or alternative fuel production projects using fuels such as  biomass and ethanol. Contractors will be expected to have the expertise to  address the potential environmental impacts, to include impacts on human  health, safety and socioeconomics, of these kinds of projects.  Current Contract Environment The six current contracts providing environmental services are  multiple-award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with a  period of performance either from September 2002 through September 2007 or  November 2002 through November 2007. At time of contract award four of  those contractors were large businesses and two were small businesses. The  business statuses of some of those companies have changed since contract  award and the large business contractors are currently Science  Applications International Corporation, Tetra Tech Inc, Battelle Memorial  Institute, and Potomac-Hudson Engineering Inc. The small business  contractors are currently AGEISS Environmental Inc. and Jason Associates  Corporation. To date, the Department has awarded forty-two tasks with a  total value of over $87 million. The profile of the task award values are  as follows: Task Value Range Number of Tasks <$100K 15 $100K up to $1M 13 $1M up to $5M 10 >$5M 4 Teaming Emphasis Given the type, size, and complexity of work envisioned for this  requirement, DOE recommends that small businesses should consider teaming  arrangement. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR  9.603), the Government will recognize the integrity and validity of  contractor team arrangements; provided the arrangements are identified and  company relationships are fully disclosed in an offer or, for arrangements  entered into after submission of an offer, before the arrangement becomes  effective. A contractor team arrangement is one where two or more  companies form a partnership or joint venture to act as a potential prime  contractor or a prime contractor agrees with one or more companies to have  them act as its subcontractors under a specified Government contract or  acquisition program. Small businesses can form a number of teaming arrangements that may  include, but not be limited to: prime/sub, an SBA-approved Mentor ProtÃ©gÃ©,  a joint venture, an SBA-approved Mentor ProtÃ©gÃ© Joint Venture. Small  businesses should consult applicable regulations related to the teaming  approach under consideration to ensure compliance with the size standard  (e.g., affiliation rules or subcontracting limitations).  Interested small business concerns are requested to submit (1) an  expression of interest (EOI) and (2) a statement of capabilities (SOC), no  later than 5 PM Mountain Time on 1 August 2007.

In addition, the EOI may include recommendations for alternative  North American Industry Classification System Codes with a discussion  supporting the proposal. The SOC shall not exceed ten (10) pages and shall include the interested  firmâ€™s complete mailing address, point of contact (name, telephone number,  and e-mail address). The SOC shall also disclose any prime/sub,  SBA-approved Mentor ProtÃ©gÃ©, joint venture, or SBA-approved Mentor ProtÃ©gÃ©  Joint Venture arrangement.

Contractors must provide a  narrative for each EIS, EA or ER addressing how its experience directly  relates to the specific technical knowledge and capabilities requirements  associated with DOE/NNSAâ€™s NEPA Program as outlined in the Technical  Requirements section above.  In addition to the above, provide a statement describing how your company  might propose to perform the percentage of work specified in Federal  Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14(b)(2) -- (At least 50 percent of the cost  of the contract incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of  the concern).

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs mentioned below. 

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to serve as the Coordinating Center (TNCC) for ??Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet?? (TrialNet) that will be responsible for communication and coordination among the Clinical Centers and for management of the collection and analysis of genetic, immunologic, pathogenetic, clinical and biological data from the clinical sites. The TNCC will also be responsible for:  (1) support of study protocols and Manuals of Operation for each TrialNet trial, (2) maintaining the TrialNet website, and (3) organizing TrialNet Steering Committee meetings, DSMB (DSMB) meetings, EAB meetings and workshops.  In addition, the TNCC will be responsible for transferring all data and biosamples that are the property of NIDDK to the appropriate NIDDK repositories.

This acquisition will be solicited with minimum and maximum requirement. Award of this acquisition will be contingent on the availability of funds. All offerors will be required to submit a minimum and maximum proposal for fulfilling the requirements.

TrialNet, an international consortium of clinical research groups with expertise in type 1 diabetes (T1D) research, was created to carry out randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trials aimed at evaluating therapies for T1D prevention and early intervention.  Principal researchers in the consortium include both a clinical diabetologist and a leading immunologist from each major Clinical Center.  The TrialNet study group consists of a Biostatistics (Data and Operations) Coordinating Center, a Chairman??s Office, 6 Core Laboratories, a Compounding Pharmacy, 14 North American Clinical Centers, 15 North American Major Affiliate Centers, 84 North American Affiliate Centers, 4 International Clinical Centers, and 16 International Affiliate Centers.  In addition, TrialNet mechanistic studies are being performed in collaboration with the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN).  The primary goal of TrialNet is to conduct studies designed to evaluate new approaches to prevent or ameliorate T1D specifically by interdicting the T1D disease process. These include interventions designed to decrease ?]-cell destruction and/or enhance ?]-cell survival.  TrialNet researchers hope that preservation of remaining ?]-cells will delay or prevent the onset of disease in at-risk individuals and will make disease control easier in individuals with new onset T1D.  Optimal diabetes control is important because studies have clearly demonstrated that tight control results in fewer long-term complications (such as blindness, kidney failure, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease).  Other TrialNet goals include (1) further characterization of diabetes risk through genetic, autoantibody, and metabolic studies in subjects identified through the Natural History, and (2) intervention studies to further develop new therapeutics through a better understanding of the immunologic bases of diabetes by analysis of serum, RNA, DNA, and cell function in at-risk and new-onset subjects as well as controls.

TrialNet has completed one clinical research study (MMTT versus GST), is in the midst of six active studies (Natural History, MMF/DZB, Anti-CD20, T Cell, NIP, and Oral Insulin) and will launch four more by the end of 2007 (Anti-CD3+Exenatide, Metabolic Control, Thymoglobulin [with ITN as lead], and IL2+Rapamycin [with ITN as lead]).  Other trials have been approved but a decision to launch has not been made due to uncertainty about available funds. TrialNet also works closely with the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium, regularly supplying them with blood samples for their studies aimed at a better understanding of the genetic basis of T1D.

The completed study (MMTT versus GST), comparing the Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT) to the Glucagon Stimulation Test (GST), was aimed at supporting the establishment of C-peptide as a reliable surrogate outcome measure for diabetes trials.  The study was designed to determine the best method for assessing insulin production during T1D clinical trials.  138 subjects, each within 3 years of diagnosis of T1D, underwent 2 MMTTs and 2 GSTs in random order within a 6 week period.  Results showed that peak C-peptide levels were significantly higher during the MMTT, indicating that detection of a C-peptide response would be more likely with the MMTT compared to the GST.  Correlation data revealed that both tests were highly reproducible, but the MMTT was significantly more reproducible than the GST.

One of the ongoing TrialNet studies is the Natural History Study.  Relatives of type 1 diabetics are recruited into the Natural History study based on HLA genotype and on the presence of certain diabetes-associated autoantibodies in the blood.  Subjects with one or more different type of diabetes autoantibody enter a program of risk assessment including glucose tolerance testing.  Once subjects are identified as being at risk for the development of diabetes, they are evaluated every 6 months to assess their autoantibody and metabolic status.  Close monitoring provides the benefit of rapid disease identification and avoidance of severe diabetes-onset related symptoms (such as ketoacidosis), and in addition, TrialNet has recently launched a pilot prevention trial for a group of at-risk subjects identified through the Natural History study.  Current plans call for screening of 20,000 individuals per year through 2011. In the event that funding is not available, the Natural History study will be terminated early and the pilot will not progress to the full trial.

Two of the TrialNet clinical research studies currently in progress involve immunumodulatory therapy in individuals with new-onset T1D.  The first of these studies, involving treatment with Mycophenolate Mofetil and Daclizumab (MMF/DZB), completed enrollment of the 120 planned subjects in November 2006.  This study includes follow-up of subjects through 2010. The second active new-onset study employing immunomodulatory therapy involves Anti-CD20 (Rituximab). To date, this study has enrolled 16 of the total 66 patients planned, and plans to follow subjects through 2009-2010.

Another TrialNet protocol underway is the T Cell Validation Study.  This mechanistic study was designed to validate four different T cell assays for reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity in detecting autoimmune responses in diabetics versus controls.  T cell measurements are expected to provide important information relating to interventions in TrialNet??s clinical trials. This study is expected to complete recruitment in the North American sites by the end of February 2007, and 3 months later in the United Kingdom.  It will involve approximately 200 subjects at all sites combined.  Another round of assay testing is expected to launch prior to the end of the first quarter 2007, and to be completed by mid 2008.

TrialNet has recently launched the Nutritional Intervention to Prevent Type 1 Diabetes Pilot Trial (NIP).  In this trial, 90 newborn infants possessing a first degree relative with T1D and no diabetes-protective HLA alleles will be randomized to receive supplemental omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (DHA) through either maternal (breast milk) or formula supplementation.  The trial is a pilot aiming to accrue all 90 subjects within one year and then follow them over 2 years. DHA will be measured in blood to determine whether the target value of 20% higher DHA is achieved in the treated compared to control group.  In addition, a 20% lower level of an inflammatory cytokine, IL1-beta, in the treated population is a primary objective of the pilot trial.  The pilot trial is expected to be completed by the end of 2009.  

The Oral Insulin Trial pilot was launched in January 2007.  This trial will test a hypothesis suggested by post hoc analysis of the earlier NIDDK-sponsored Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT-1).  That trial suggested that individuals with high levels of insulin autoantibodies in their blood, as well as other characteristics resulting in a 25-50% chance of getting T1D over the subsequent 5 years, could delay or prevent the onset of diabetes by taking insulin by mouth.  TrialNet will confirm or refute the hypothesis by recruiting subjects with similar characteristics into a trial involving daily insulin or placebo ingestion over approximately 5-8 years.  The trial is expected to recruit approximately 300 subjects through 2011 and follow them through 2018. In the event that funding is not available, the trial will halt recruiting and subjects will be followed as funding permits, if scientifically warranted.
Two additional TrialNet-led intervention trials are approved and under development, Anti-CD3+Exenatide and Metabolic Control. The Anti-CD3+Exenatide trial will be a randomized controlled open label trial.  Recently-diagnosed type 1 diabetics will be treated with a GLP-1 agonist, Exenatide, which is expected to promote insulin responsiveness and to help maintain residual ??-cell activity, and Anti-CD3 which has been previously determined to delay the decline in C-peptide production in newly-diagnosed T1D patients.  After safety review of the combination of drugs in 30 patients, the plan is to extend the treatment to 130 additional subjects. In addition, a 4-arm trial is being planned for subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, not yet clinically diabetic, but with an 80% risk of developing frank diabetes over the subsequent 5 years.  For new onset trials the primary endpoints are C-peptide production at 1 or 2 years, while the prevention trial will use diabetes onset as the primary endpoint.  The new-onset trial is expected to be completed in 2010, while the prevention trial is expected to be finished in 2012.  In the event that funding is not available, the prevention trial will not be initiated. 

The newly approved Metabolic Control trial aims to provide very intensive metabolic control to subjects within a few days of T1D onset.  The plan is to use a system of continuous glucose monitoring and closed-loop insulin delivery in the hospital, followed by intense monitoring and insulin pump at home.  The patients will be randomized to either very intense or standard-of-care treatment and followed for C peptide production at 1 and 2 years post diagnosis, and should be completed in 2010.   

The contract is for a ten-year period, unless funding is not available, in which case the contract will be for a 4 to 5 year period.  As can be readily appreciated by the above descriptions, the TrialNet consortium has embarked upon a series of complex and challenging studies and trials, aimed at taking full advantage of the current opportunities for diabetes intervention, and to offer reasonable therapeutic options to recently diagnosed and at risk populations.  In each case, statistical methods and trial design have emphasized maximizing efficiency and minimizing trial duration by, for example, using maximum information design whenever possible.  In addition, by investing in infrastructure for recruiting, TrialNet expects to maximize efficiency and to capture all patient populations for which trial opportunities exist.  Finally, by investing in studies to optimize diabetes risk assessment, and to optimize clinical tests and validate mechanistic assays, TrialNet hopes to produce accurate and reliable information to allow optimization of the information to be extracted from each clinical trial and subject.  These activities are expected to provide the basis for treatments that can significantly delay or stop the decline of ??-cell function in subjects at risk for or recently diagnosed with T1D.

Current plans are to continue to launch a limited number of approved new trials though 2008.  Additional approved new trials will be launched only if sufficient funds are available.  Thereafter, if funding resources do not continue, TrialNet and the TNCC will adjust operations for completion of active trials launched by 2008, but will cease the initiation of new trials or the transition from pilot trials to full trials.  If funding continues, TrialNet will continue to solicit, review, develop, and execute new trials, and the TNCC operation will be maintained to accommodate those needs. It is expected that new trials will replace old ones and the TrialNet consortium will operate as projected herein.

Project Overview:

Work to be performed under this contract may include design, development and launch of approved studies as well as execution of protocols including screening, recruitment, intervention, and follow-up according to schedules and procedures contained in the studies?? Manuals of Operations.  The TNCC shall receive, manage, and analyze data obtained from the Clinical Centers. Clinical Centers and Core Laboratories will be responsible for reporting data on standardized study forms supplied by the TNCC.

Below is an overview of the subcontracts to the TNCC:  

TrialNet Coordinating Center Subcontracts

Clinical Centers ?V There are 17 TrialNet Clinical Centers located in North America, Europe, and Australia.  These Centers receive infrastructure support as well as per-patient capitated reimbursements.  All of the Clinical Centers enroll patients into multiple TrialNet clinical research studies and will thus need to continue to follow their TrialNet study patients until all protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Clinical Center Subcontractors ?V Several of the Clinical Centers have subcontractors working with them on TrialNet projects.  They are subcontractors because they are located at sites that are distinct from (but generally close to) the parent Clinical Center.  The subcontractors that enroll patients into TrialNet clinical research studies will need to continue to follow their TrialNet study patients until all protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Major Affiliate Centers ?V There are 17 TrialNet Major Affiliate Centers located in North America.  These Centers receive infrastructure support as well as per-patient capitated reimbursements.  All of the Major Affiliates enroll patients into one or more TrialNet clinical research studies and will thus need to continue to follow their TrialNet study patients until the pertinent TrialNet protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Affiliate Centers ?V There are currently 178 TrialNet Affiliate Centers located in North America.  These Centers receive per-patient capitated reimbursements.  Almost all of the Affiliate Centers enroll patients into one or more TrialNet clinical research studies and will thus need to continue to follow their TrialNet study patients until the pertinent TrialNet protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Core Laboratories ?V There are 5 TrialNet Core Laboratories located in North America.  These Core Laboratories receive infrastructure support to perform as central laboratories for all of the TrialNet studies.  It is crucial that the TrialNet Core Laboratories remain unchanged so that the intra- and inter-study laboratory data remains optimally comparable and reliable.  The Core Laboratories will need to continue to analyze TrialNet samples generated by TrialNet clinical research studies until the TrialNet protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Laboratories ?V There are 7 TrialNet Laboratories located in North America and Europe.  These laboratories perform studies specific to one or more TrialNet studies.  These laboratories will need to remain constant until the studies they are involved with are completed to ensure optimization of intra- and inter-study data.  

Medical Monitor ?V The TrialNet Medical Monitor oversees the adverse event process related to all TrialNet studies.  This includes planning for tracking and evaluating adverse events, processing adverse event reports, and reporting adverse events to the appropriate parties, including the DSMB, IRBs, and appropriate regulatory agencies.  

Central Pharmacy and Supplies ?V The TrialNet Central Pharmacy handles all aspects of receipt, processing, and distribution of TrialNet study drug supplies.  For some studies, this includes production of drug and placebo.  This group also handles distribution of various medical supplies to the TrialNet sites.

Consultants ?V TrialNet utilizes consultants to assist with various TrialNet functions.  These consultants advise TrialNet on psychosocial and infectious disease issues related to the conduct of TrialNet trials.
A detailed listing of the 230+ clinical centers, affiliate centers, laboratories, central pharmacy, medical monitor, and consultants will be provided upon the release of the Request for Proposal.

<DESC>The United State Air Force is seeking information from interested parties on a replacement for current space-based and ground-based space environmental monitoring capabilities with a possible start in 2010.  Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Block 5D3 carries a five sensor DMSP Space Environmental Sensors (SESS).    The Air Force has a requirement to continue to collect space environmental data in the most cost effective way possible when the DMSP mission ends. Likewise, current ground-based space environmental monitoring capabilities are approaching the end of their design life and are in need of refurbishment or replacement.  These capabilities include the Solar Observing Optical Network (SOON), Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN), and other ground based sensors.

Together, these space-based and ground-based space environmental monitoring capabilities generate data stored in the Joint Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Database (JMDB) at Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and used by Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System (SWAFS) for analysis, specification, and forecast of the ionosphere, magnetosphere, thermosphere, solar surface, and solar wind/ Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF).  This JMDB space weather data is run through SWAFS software algorithms and models and used by AFWA?s 2nd Weather Squadron to analyze and forecast space environmental impacts on communications, radar, satellite operations, space tracking, navigation, and intelligence collection systems.  Additionally, SWAFS software products and space environmental data from the JMDB are coupled with satellite command and control (C2) and state of health (SOH) data to generate space situational awareness (SSA) products at the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC).  End-to-end continuity of space environmental monitoring, analysis, specification, and forecasting capabilities is required for environmental data fusion in support of SSA.                       

Many studies have been accomplished that point out the importance of space weather.  NSSA developed credible space architecture in 1999. The AF is interested in continuing the collection of data from a DMSP SESS mission as well as upgraded ground sensors. However, equally as important as data gathering is the importance of exploiting the data, the rapid ingestion, processing analysis and dissemination in a manner suitable to user needs.  Thus, the Air Force is interested in talking with organizations (government, labs, spacecraft, and spacecraft sensor contractors) who understand the effect of space weather on their systems and mission areas. Though this RFI addresses the space segment of the space weather end to end architecture, future RFIs may seek feedback from contractors and labs on data exploitation.

Any future acquisition program will be structured to support a block approach to development and technology insertion.  Block 1 will be low risk using proven technologies (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7+) integrated on proven bus and launch vehicles provided by contractors with a documented proven track record of mission success.  We are planning to implement incremental delivery strategy to more rapidly provide initial capability, while concurrently investing in science and technology (S&T) development to support later blocks.  This is in line with the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for Space?s letter dated 14 March 2007, titled ??Back to Basics? and Implementing a Block Approach for Space Acquisition?.

<CONTACT>ALEISHA  MOORE, PURCHASING AGENT, Phone 304-256-3215, Fax 304-256-3350, Email MOORE.ALEISHA@DOL.GOV
<DESC>MSHA IS SEEKING SOURCES FOR THE FOLLOWING:
Background:

While filling an SCBA oxygen tank for mine rescue training, a large, extremely hot fire erupted at an oxygen pump severely burning the Benchman.  The root cause of the fire was inadequate training of mine personnel in the setup, maintenance, and operation of the SCBA filling system.  Provisions of the new Miner Act that require more mine rescue teams and additional mine rescue training will increase the use of SCBA?s and the likelihood of another oxygen fire and injury.  To stay ahead of this risk, a training video will be developed to cover oxygen fire hazards and the precautions needed to help ensure the safe refilling of SCBA?s using oxygen booster pumps.


Final Product:

A training video, in DVD format, shall be prepared.  The video shall deal with the fire hazards of filling SCBA?s using an oxygen booster pump.  The video shall cover the entire SCBA filling process, including but not limited to, installation/construction of the refilling facility, receipt of oxygen supply bottles, maintenance of equipment, and training of personnel.  The video will be prepared for an audience of mining personnel that have received some prior training in the filling of SCBA?s. 

Deliverables:

The contractor will prepare a draft script and suggest various video footage/graphics required.  The contractor will coordinate with MSHA in determining the overall presentation concepts.  The contractor should rely on MSHA for administrative functions in order to control contract costs.  

MSHA will coordinate input and review of the script by MSHA and industry personnel (mine operators, mine rescue team benchmen, booster pump manufacturers, O2 suppliers, and others as necessary).   

Upon approval of the script by MSHA the contractor will assist MSHA in defining the video storyboard.  The contractor will help define the shots required and shoot and edit the video as required.

<DESC>17.	 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is seeking sources that are capable of upgrading an existing Deepwater Maritime Operation Effectiveness Simulation System (DMOES).  The USCG is seeking to gain insight into the current state of campaign level simulation modeling technology as we plan for the replacement or expansion of the current campaign model.  The USCG is seeking what capabilities exist to fulfill this requirement and if any vendors can fulfill this requirement under their existing GSA contract.  Additionally, please acknowledge if you are a vendor on the FirstSource or EAGLE contracts that this work effort would get under.  At a minimum, the upgrade requirements for the simulator include: (1) to be Department of Defense (DOD) High Level Architecture (HLA) compliant (2) a graphical user interface with the capability to create and prioritize asset patrol areas, adjust force mixes and alter asset capabilities; (3) an autonomous air and surface asset scheduling program, capable of prioritizing competing USCG missions, adhering to asset endurance limitations, and assigning the correct type of USCG asset to a patrol area or respond to an emergent mission; and (4) optimize hardware infrastructure requirements that minimize simulation run time while controlling hardware cost.  It is desirable that the replacement model represents all USCG surface assets larger than the USCG?s 87? patrol boats and all USCG aviation assets.  The replacement model should be capable of incorporating all vessel traffic, threats, and demands existing in the USCG area of responsibility.  The existing hardware would be expected to be utilized to the maximum extent possible.  There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor?s information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Please submit information to include FirstSource, EAGLE and GSA Schedule information should it be applicable, via email to Ms. Sandra A. Queen at Sandra.A.Queen@uscg.mil and Ms. Jennifer L.

<DESC>This solicitation is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/  and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at  http://www.neco.navy.mil  .    While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division has a requirement for quantity three (3) upgrades to existing Teradyne 9100 testers in accordance with a Government Statement of Work (SOW).  A fixed price contract modification to existing contract N00164-06-C-6815 is anticipated to procure these upgrades as follows: CLIN 0032 is the NGT2 Teradyne 9100 upgrade.  The required delivery date is 30 November 2007.  Initial Government inspection and acceptance will be at origin and final acceptance will be at destination. CLIN 0033 is the NGT3 Teradyne 9100 upgrade.  The required delivery date is 30 November 2007.  Initial Government inspection and acceptance will be at origin and final acceptance will be at destination. CLIN 0034 is the NGT1 Teradyne 9100 upgrade.  The required delivery date is 28 February 2008.  Initial Government inspection and acceptance will be at origin and final acceptance will be at destination.   The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this contract modification on a sole-source basis to Teradyne, 600 Riverpark Dr. North Reading, MD 01864-2634.  The basis for restricting competition is that Teradyne, being the Original Equipment Manufacturer, is the only known source for each of the items that can satisfy the Government’s requirements, and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.    Numbered Note 22 applies.  All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to Crane web site, FedBizOpps and NECO.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and/or NECO.

<SUBJECT>B -- Industry Accounts Feasibility Study
<DESC>This is a synopsis to request a study to determine the feasibility of developing a consistent set of NAICS-based Benchmark and Annual I-0 accounts, reflecting all NIPA comprehensive revisions through 2003.


Industry Accounts Feasibility Study for Historic I-O Estimate Project


Overview:

This task order is to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of developing a consistent set of NAICS-based Benchmark and Annual Input-Output (I-O) accounts, which reflect all comprehensive revisions of the National Income and Products Accounts through 2003.  Estimates will be developed for the years 1947 through 1997. 

Developing a set consistent time series of benchmark and annual I-O accounts is an important additional product for the Industry Accounts.  A consistent time series will provide BEA data users with the data necessary to conduct long-term studies on the changing structure of the U.S. economy.  In addition, a consistent time series provides the important data inputs for studying changes in industry productivity growth.


Development of Backcast NAICS-based estimates:

?	BEA envisions three major deliverables on this task order for which MacroSys will conduct research and develop initial estimates, as well as a proposal, for BEA?s approval, on how MacroSys intends to proceed developing the estimates updated to reflect the necessary methodological and definitional changes. 
1.	Develop initial benchmark and annual I-O estimates on a 1997 NAICS basis for the years 1947-1997.  These estimates, in particular, will reflect the most important definitional, conceptual, and methodological revisions that have implications for industry and commodity estimates.  
2.	Develop a plan for preparing a more complete and robust methodology to estimate a consistent set of historic benchmark and annual I-O tables.  The methodology should identify data needs and should note which definitional and methodological elements may be more difficult to have updated. 
3.	Develop a proposal that identifies timing for how the conversion process will take place.  The proposal should also include identification of the major steps involved in developing and evaluating the estimates.

?	Where practical, the contractor shall identify data sets available at no charge.  However, if purchases of additional data sets are required, the government will review and approve the proposed data set prior to purchase by the contractor.

<DESC>SAMPLE WEAVING SYSTEM

Description:

The Southern Regional Research Center Agricultural Research Service, U.S.D.A. is seeking bids for a Sample Weaving System as a means to produce woven fabric from small quantities of cotton yarn.

Research Objectives:

There is a need to produce woven fabric from small quantities of cotton yarn, of sufficient length to permit the measurement of physical properties in addition to providing a sample to allow the cloth to be examined for imperfections before and after dyeing, as well as measurements of color. The weaving system is the final part of an integrated system to provide yarn and fabric for testing, from fibers harvested from cotton plants under development for possible release as a cultivar.

Technical Specifications Required:

1.)	A means to produce a fabric woven entirely from a single package that may hold at least 2 pounds of yarn.

2.)	Typically the fabric will be about 20 inches wide and about 100 inches long.

3.)	A possible system would include a single yarn slasher for the production of sized yarn, a sample warping machine to produce a warp of several hundred ends, and a sample weaving machine to produce the fabric. 

4.)	The weaving system will be versatile, capable of producing a range of simple woven structures ranging from plain to sateen weaves, possibly requiring the use of 14 or more shafts, with single pick insertion.

5.)	Electronic control of warp let-off and fabric take-up motions are highly desirable mechanisms to insure consistent fabric structure and tension history between sample lots.



All systems and components shall be provided with a 1-year warranty from the date of installation. The warranty shall cover all system parts against manufacturing defect or failure during normal service covering service labor and travel expenses.

ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES MAY SUBMIT A BID FOR CONSIDERATION TO

The Request for Proposal (RFP) number is FA8604-07-R-7037.  This  solicitation and incorporated clauses/provisions are those in effect  through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-17 & Class Deviation  2005-o0001 and DFARS Current to DCN 20070531 Edition.

The existence of the  ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager,  contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman  does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection  process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The  ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the  concern. 	(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first  address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to  the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not  alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency  level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings,  employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition  performance decisions). 	(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned  parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Craig A. Cassino,  ASC/AE; email: Craig.Cassino@wpafb.af.mil; Phone (937) 255-5995. Concerns,  issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the  MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further  consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant  Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon,  Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number  (703) 588-1067. 	(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the  agency. 	(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation,  verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries  shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. The period of performance for this acquisition is 18 months. One (1) base  year (12 months) plus one (1) Option Period (6 months), starting  approximately 30 September 2007. This acquisition is reserved for small  business. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, small disadvantaged business,  woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business or service disabled  veteran-owned small business, and should also indicate if the firm is  foreign-owned. Foreign contractor participation is not permitted. This solicitation is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside NAICS Code: 541511 Size Standard:  $23,000,000 Contractors responding to this RFP shall submit their proposals in  accordance with the attached solicitation by 4:00 PM EST on 8 August 2007. Questions concerning this requirement should be sent in writing to the  Contract Negotiator, Kevin Poole, by e-mail at kevin.poole@wpafb.af.mil. OVERVIEW: The heightened operational tempo of worldwide military and disaster relief  missions is stretching Air Force capabilities thin and significantly  increasing “wear and tear” on both equipment and personnel.  Visibility  into expeditionary operations is constrained due to “stove-piped” legacy  systems and manually “integrated” business practices.  Excessive time is  required to obtain, reconcile, and assess mission-critical information. The lessons learned from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrates  that improvements in air combat support planning and execution are  urgently needed in order to deliver more responsive and effective mission  capabilities to warfighters.  Specific examples of known problems include: •	Compressed crisis action planning timelines result in numerous  misalignments of forces, with illogical phased movements and forces  frequently deployed to the wrong locations. •	Planners have difficulty accurately depicting operational impacts based  on air combat support posture. •	There is a lack of experience in establishing expeditionary bases in  austere conditions. •	Combat support has different meanings within the Joint Service  community, leading to issues resulting from  miscommunication/interpretation among services. •	Feedback mechanisms and performance measurement evaluations are  incomplete; metrics are defined and tracked, but with no goals and  standards for assessment being defined. These problems result in commands and headquarters not having timely,  actionable air combat support information, thereby adversely affecting  their ability to conduct timely and effective air operations. The Directorate of Logistics and Sustainment, Headquarters United States  Air Force Materiel Command (HQ AFMC/A4), intends to implement and improve  logistical command and control decision support and supply chain processes  in order to improve global combat support of air operations.  To implement  these changes, HQ AFMC/A4 requires consulting services to collaborate with  key process stakeholders throughout the logistics and operations  communities across the Department of Defense (DoD).  Technical services  are also needed to provide rapid prototyping capabilities that allow  insight to the programmatic and policy actions needed to rapidly improve  the fusion between combat support and air operations; significantly  improving the timeliness and effectiveness of logistical support across  the combat support domain.

 HSAR 3052.209?70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Clauses incorporated by reference may be accessed in full text at www.arnet.gov.  The lessor/contractor shall agree to insert terms that conform substantially to the language of this clause in all contracts/subcontracts.  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS - Upon award of the contract, the contractor, primary subcontractor(s), key supervisory personnel, and/or any other contract individuals designated by the FBI, who require access to any FBI information, facility, or property, must accurately complete Standard Form SF-86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions, (Revision 9/95) and two copies of Form FD-258 (fingerprint card).  All other contract individuals must furnish requested biographical information to appropriate FBI personnel and accurately complete FD-816, "Background Data Information Form," Form FD-484 (Privacy Act Acknowledgement), and two copies of Form FD-258 (fingerprint card).  These forms and information are to be completed and furnished to the FBI at least 25 workdays prior to the arrival of contract individual to the site of the work under the contract.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure all contractor personnel are in full compliance with applicable Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Department of Justice, Employment Eligibility Verification requirements, such as those set forth in Title 8, U.S. Code, and Section 274a.  A background investigation, the scope of which will be at the discretion of the FBI, will be conducted on these individuals.  At the discretion of the FBI, contract individuals may also be interviewed by the FBI (or FBI contract investigators) regarding foreign travel, associates, residences, or other matters of concern to the FBI in deciding whether to grant access to its information, facilities, or property, and may be requested to undergo a polygraph examination to fully resolve any security concerns.  Refusal or failure to accurately complete the forms, to be interviewed, or to undergo a polygraph examination to resolve any questionable matters will be deemed reasonable cause for denial of access to FBI information, facilities, or property.  Lack of candor may also be a strong factor for denial of access.  Access to FBI information, facilities, or property will be granted only where such access is clearly consistent with the mission and responsibilities of the FBI.  If for any reason a contract individual is denied access to any FBI information, facility, or property, the FBI will not disclose to the contractor the reason for denial and will only make such disclosure to the affected contractor employee pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information or Privacy Acts.  The FBI will not be liable for any expense in the replacement of the individual or any costs incurred by the contractor as a result of such denial.  It is the policy of the FBI that these individuals already be employed by the contracting organization/individual (i.e., that the individual's employment not hinge upon an access or security clearance determination by the FBI) and the FBI will assume no liability between the contracting organization and its employees as a result of this procedure.  The FBI reserves the right to revoke any contract individual's access to its information, facilities, or property where such access is no longer clearly consistent with the FBI's mission and responsibilities, and the contractor agrees to immediately remove that individual from the work-site under such circumstances.  In cases of access revocation, the FBI will inform the individual of the basis for the revocation, unless to do so would reveal classified or sensitive information, and give the individual an opportunity to explain, rebut, or refute such basis in writing.  Access will remain revoked pending prompt review of any such submission by the individual.  The FBI reserves the right to reinvestigate contract individuals on a periodic basis (usually every five years) or where facts or information indicate the continued access may no longer be clearly consistent with the FBI's mission and responsibilities. The scope of any reinvestigation will be at the sole discretion of the FBI.  Refusal or failure to accurately complete any necessary forms, to be interviewed, or to undergo a polygraph examination to resolve any questionable matters during a reinvestigation will be deemed reasonable cause for revocation of access to FBI facilities, information, or property.  Appropriate badges may be furnished by the FBI authorizing escorted or unescorted access to FBI facilities and property. The badge, if furnished, will be kept at a location to be determined by the FBI and shall be picked up by the contract individual granted access upon arrival at FBI premises. Consistent with life/safety factors, it shall be worn at all times on the upper part of the body so as to be clearly visible and will be returned to the FBI whenever the wearer leaves FBI premises for any reason or any length of time. The FBI may require all contract and subcontract individuals to execute a security awareness briefing form, FD-835, Security Acknowledgement Form.  The Government will not pay for any information received. All quotes from responsible sources will be considered. Quotes shall be accepted by e-mail only. Quotes shall be e-mailed to Bryan.Lane@ic.fbi.gov no later than 9:00 AM EST, August 2, 2007.  No other methods of submission will be accepted.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. In order to be considered for an award, an offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications located at http://orca.bpn.gov/  in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a) and must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database (http://www.ccr.gov).  An award is anticipated within one (1) week after closing.

                   WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

***All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following:

 Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) High Temperature Ion Funnel ? Ion Mobility System, which shall meet or exceed the following salient characteristics:

The vendor shall supply the RF power supply and plate assembly for installation into the half meter high temperature ion mobility unit of a mass spectrometer, which is resident at NIST. The RF power supply shall have two RF outputs that transmit signals through MHV bulkhead connectors to the ion funnel. The ion funnel shall operate in a low vacuum (130 to 1400 Pascal). The ion funnel and mobility assemblies together shall comprise a system of approximately 160 electrode plates, insulators, and other components. As the ion mobility assembly shall reside in a half meter long oven, its materials shall be compatible with operation in the temperature range of 10C and 550C in an environment of 130 to 1400 Pascal nitrogen and/or argon and trace partial pressures of solvents commonly used in electrospray ion sources. Due to the thermal stress induced by the adjacent ion mobility cell oven, the accumulated capacitive load (2000 to 5000 pF) experienced by the RF power supply will vary. In response to this constantly changing load and in the absence of operator intervention, the RF power supply shall self adjust its frequency to maintain the optimum RF coupling. The component specifications are:
1. RF Power Supply for Ion Funnels (specifications, as measured at the MHV vacuum connectors when coupled to the ion funnel):
a.	The RF power supply (nominally 40 Watts) shall have two RF outputs that transmit 0 to 300 RF Volts peak to peak signals to vacuum side capacitance loads (accessed by MHV connectors) that range between 1,000 to 5,000 pF.  
b.	The frequency and standing wave ratio (SWR) of the RF supply shall self adjust to the highest possible frequency in the range of 300 to 700 kHz as the ion funnel dimensions change due to exposure to the adjacent ion mobility spectrometer oven. 
c.	RF amplitude can be set manually via a potentiometer on the front panel or with a 0 to 5 Volt DC analog signal to an external connector on the rear panel.
d.	The RF PS shall have a user accessed back panel potentiometer enabling the end user to de rate the power supply, so that it cannot exceed a chosen output voltage. 
e.	A front panel digital voltmeter shall display the peak to peak RF voltage output. 
f.	A vacuum interlock input connector, mounted on the back panel, can sense a remote contact closure (e.g., a contact closure from a vacuum pressure gauge), so that the unit responds by disabling high voltage operation.
g.	The power supply shall include one pair of 36 inch long RG 62 cables with MHV connectors on each end.
h.	Universal AC input (100 to 240VAC, 50 to 60 Hz).
i.	Vendor shall warrant the unit for 1 year, parts and labor.

2. Plate assembly for a half meter high temperature ion mobility system with ion funnel:
a.	The ion funnel subsection shall comprise have a 38 mm entrance aperture and 2 mm exit aperture with a plate gate to allow for ion storage in the RF field. 
b.	The ion funnel assembly shall not exceed a 100 mm diameter (to allow for vacuum housing and gas conductance).
c.	The ion funnel section and ion gate optics shall conduct ions 14.5 cm to the ion mobility unit.
d.	To fit the 50 cm long oven, the ion mobility drift tube assembly shall comprise no fewer than 78 electrodes of 6.4 mm (nominal) spacing; no conductive assembly elements shall contact the 79 mm diameter oven bore.
e.	Except for the oven entrance and exit electrodes that shall have an aperture diameter of 1.0 mm, the ion mobility electrode assembly shall have electrodes of an aperture diameter that is equal the electrode spacing. 
f.	 The ion mobility assembly (electrodes, insulators, rods, etc) shall be compatible with operation in the temperature range of 0C and 550C in nitrogen and argon atmospheres at 130 to 1400 Pascal.
The exit optics assembly of the ion mobility assembly shall conduct ions a distance of 17.6 cm from the oven exit and terminate with ion optical elements that focus the ions into the 0.5 mm entrance aperture of the mass spectrometer system.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13 (not to exceed $100,000). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This Solicitation, No. NFFN7400718391DT, is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18.

This procurement is a TOTAL small business set aside. The NAICS code for this procurement is 326199, All Other Plastics Product Manufacturing. The small business size standard is 500 employees.  

Background: The NOAA Fisheries Service (NFS) pumps large quantities of natural seawater from the Gulf of Mexico and it is stored in above ground, fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) tanks. Water is heated in some tanks to provide warm water to tropical marine animals throughout the winter months. Heated tanks are insulated with a layer of foam insulation on the outside of the FRP inner tank. The foam is protected by a layer of paint on most tanks, which has not been sufficient to protect the foam from U/V damage, wind or windborne projectiles. The foam is damaged and missing in large sections, on all tanks where there was no external protecting skin applied to the foam. The damaged foam is letting sunlight penetrate the tanks resulting in the growth of unwanted algae and also heat loss in the winter. Only the sides and domed top are insulated, there was no insulation applied to the bottom of the tanks which results in massive heat loss into the concrete slab below the tanks. None of the original tanks have either lifting lugs, or tie-downs, making them vulnerable to toppling in tropical force winds. The tanks have toppled and rolled during hurricanes in the past. There is no provision built into the current tanks for complete drainage and it is nearly impossible to remove the built up silt, bacteria, and sludge on the tank bottoms. Many of these tanks are now 30+ years old and in need of replacement.

Statement of Work: The contractor shall provide replacement tanks fully insulated on all surfaces including the bottom.

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Stylus Measuring Instrument to be used in the Precision Engineering Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***

Background:  
The Precision Engineering Division at NIST has a requirement for a stylus contacting surface measuring instrument.  The instrument shall be a skidless system having a horizontal (X) motion slide on a flat reference surface (datum).  Surface profiles are scanned, digitized, and analyzed using a computer control system.  Instrument shall have sufficient range to measure partial forms of curved surfaces, such as hardness indenter tips, land impressions of fired bullets, etc.  Vertical resolution shall be high enough as to accurately record profiles with very small undulations in the nanometer range.  Exact requirements including ranges, resolutions, etc. are described below in the ?Component Details? section.
Line Item 0001:  One (1) Each, Measuring Stylus Instrument

The Contractor shall meet or exceed the following minimum technical specifications: 

Instrumentation:
Instrument shall be equipped with a stylus measuring gauge, traversing units (X, Y, Theta), vertical drive column, granite support base, and isolation system (rubber pads, air bladders, pressurized air isolation table, etc.) mounted on a steel support frame.  Also included, shall be the computer system used to control the instrumentation and analyze the measurements.

Component Details:
1.	Measuring Ranges (minimum requirements)
?	X ? 200mm Tracing length
?	Y ? 75mm
?	Gauge (vertical Measuring range) ? 12mm
?	Z Column range ? 300mm
?	Rotary Theta stage ? Full 360 degrees operation

2.	Resolutions (minimum requirements):
?	X ? Data point spacing shall be 0.125 micrometers or less
?	Y ? 1 micrometers or less
?	Gauge ? Vertical resolution shall be less than 1nm.
?	Rotary Theta stage ? 0.5 degrees

3.	Measurement Speeds - A range of measurement speeds is desirable.  Minimum speed shall be 0.25mm/sec or slower.

4.	Instrument Noise shall be less than or equal to 1.7 nm Ra, as measured on an optical flat, using a digital Gaussian filter with long cutoff of 0.25mm and short cutoff of 2.5 micrometers.  

NOTE:  Instrument gauge resolution may play a factor in determining the noise floor.  However, the real world instrument noise shall be the deciding factor in determining vertical performance.

5.	Straightness ? The straightness of the X axis shall be 0.125 micrometers or less in Z over 200mm X traverse, using a waviness Gaussian filter of 2.5mm.

6.	Y Stage and Rotary stage must be computer controlled and programmable (see Software Item 2).

7.	Stylus Tip ? Included stylus tip shall be made of diamond, with a nominal conical radius of 2 micrometers and nominal flank angles of 45 degrees (90 degrees included angle).  Special tips shall also be available for future purchase(s) as needed (This item is not a part of this requirement and therefore, does not require pricing.  This is to be provided for informational purposes only): 
?	30 degrees flank angles (60 degrees included angle), 1 micrometers nominal radius, diamond
?	3mm or 5mm ruby ball mounted on 120mm arm
?	Chisel shape tip

8.	Stylus Contacting Force ? 0.0005N ? 0.001N (50mg ? 100mg).

9.	A programmable stylus lift is required such that the stylus can be lifted via computer control to various positions in the stylus range.  This will allow upward movement of the stylus, but will hold it from moving downward.  This feature is useful when doing tip radius characterizations using a razor blade technique.  It also prevents the stylus tip from being dragged across the surface when moving out of contact with a sample.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:
1. System must have a cluster of 4 discreet SDD elements with the performance specified in #2 below, combined in software for a composite spectrum.  The strategy of 4 detector elements seeks to minimize the peak coincidence effects by enabling each detector to operate at 25% the speed of the desired output count rate;

2. Each SDD detector element must be capable of performing with a resolution of 133 eV (full peak width at half peak intensity, FWHM at Mn K alpha, 5895 eV) or better with a peaking time constant that permits an output count rate (OCR) of  at least 100,000 counts per second (cps); The  peak width measured at FWHM at Mn K alpha must be constant within plus or minus 5 eV up to a deadtime of 60 percent;

3.  The peak channel value must be constant within plus or minus 5 eV up to a deadtime of 60 percent.  The energy channel width for the spectrum used for this stability test must have a width of 5 eV/channel or less.  Alternatively, the peak shape must be fit using a mathematical model (e.g. Gaussian, split Pearson, Voigt, 	functions), and the peak center must be constant within plus or minus 5 eV up to a deadtime of 60 percent; 

4. Each SDD detector element must be capable of performing with an x-ray mapping resolution of 133 eV (FWHM at Mn K alpha, 5895 eV) or better with a peaking time constant that permits an OCR of 250,000 cps or higher for each chip.  The peak width measured at MnK alpha must be constant within plus or minus 10 eV up to a deadtime of 60 percent.  The peak channel value must be constant within plus or minus 10 eV up to a deadtime of 60 percent. 

5.  The hardware and software systems must be capable of both recording the output of  each individual detector or combining the output of all four detectors into a composite spectrum, selectable by the user.  The composite spectrum of all four 
detectors must  have a resolution of 133 eV or better with a total OCR of 1,000,000 cps or higher.

ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT
Software must be flexible and adaptable to export formats for raw, unprocessed x-ray spectrum image data.  Compatibility and interoperability with NIST?s existing analysis software is required.  Specifically:

(a) Complete disclosure and documentation of the native spectrum and spectrum image file format of the software.  This will permit NIST to develop software to read and write these formats;

(b) Alternatively, it must be possible to export the x-ray spectrum image file as a brick of bytes or raw file format which will consist of a continuous string of numbers, no header, no compression, no encoding to eliminate blocks of zeros, etc., spectrum by spectrum, row by row of the x-y scan.  All of the numbers are in the same format, such as 16 bit signed 
integer, IEEE 8-byte real, 8-bit unsigned byte, etc.   The raw file will be accompanied by a text file with the same name and .rpl extension.  This is a NIST Lispix file that lists the characteristics of the raw file so that it can be loaded without human intervention. There are eight parameters, listed in the table below.  CAPITAL LETTERS indicates the options for a 
parameter, rather than a description of the parameter. The order of the parameters in the .rpl file is important.
	 Name        Description                
      	Width        number pixels per row       integer   
        Height       number rows                 integer
     	Depth        number images or spec pts   integer 
      	offset       number bytes to skip asterisk  integer
      	Data-type    SIGNED, UNSIGNED or FLOAT   
      	data-length  number bytes per pixel      1, 2, 4, or 8
      	Byte-Order   BIG-ENDIAN, LITTLE_ENDIAN, or DON?T CARE	
	Record-by    IMAGE, VECTOR, or DON?T-CARE        
					
	This is an example RPL file.  There are eight rows (lines) in the file, with two words or numbers per line, 
separated by a tab and any number of spaces.
	key		value
	width	       128   
	height	       96    
	depth	       101   
	offset	       0     
	data-length    2     
	data-type	signed      
	byte-order	little-endian     
	record-by	image

<DESC>The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, material,  	   
and equipment necessary to successfully perform 
business management, systems engineering, software 
development and prototype development for the Micro 
Compass Magnetometer (MCM).  Equipment provided by 
the Contractor includes tools for micro electromechanical 
system (MEMS) design, lithographic, deposition and 
processing; silicon MEMS fabrication; measurement and 
test; and packaging.
***See attached solicitation package for complete details***
***Amend 01 ? Contact Rachel Hier via email to request a copy of the solicitation package.***
***Amen 02 ? Corrected Section M*** Section M Evaluation Factors for Award
Directions, Basis for Award and Contractor Guidelines: 
All prospective Offerors should prepare a detailed response to this RFQ based on the objectives and requirements identified. The Government?s contract objective is to obtain the highest technical quality necessary to develop and demonstrate a Microcompass Magnetometer (MCM) involving Micro Electromechanical System (MEMS) realizations of ultrasensitive magnetometers, with a realistic and reasonable cost. To meet this objective the GSA anticipates awarding a single commercial purchase order to the sole responsible offeror, whose offer conforming to the solicitation, judged to represent the ?Best Value? to the Government. 
 
The Contracting Officer will make a best value determination with the assistance of BCBL-H technical personnel, considering both price and non-price factors. This evaluation will include past performance and experience as described in the below detailed evaluation criteria and other Department of Defense policies, procedures, and directives. 
 
Offerors will receive an overall rating for each area of evaluation in relation to the non-cost/price and cost/price areas of assessment by the respective evaluation panels. The non-cost/price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost/price; however, cost/price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. 
 
Selection and Evaluation Criteria: The selection and evaluation criteria for the non-cost/price and cost/price evaluation areas are outlined below. Each area of evaluation will include an assessment of risk (see General Note 7). Offerors are hereby notified that the evaluation factors and major sub factors within each area are identified below. This document contains sufficient evaluation criteria that offerors can draw adequate correlation between the stated evaluation criteria herein and any sub factors that may be evaluated equally for all responsive quotations received. It is essential that offerors furnish the Government with adequate and specific quotations. Cursory responses or responses which merely reiterate or reformulate Section C will not be considered as being responsive to this solicitation. 
 
Offerors are advised that any evaluation sub factors receiving a ?Marginal? or ?Unsatisfactory? rating may have a disproportionate negative impact on the overall factor rating and/or risk assessment.  Any quotes failing to offer a solution to one or more sub factors may be deemed not to have met the minimum mandatory requirements and may be eliminated from further consideration. Any offeror eliminated from further consideration will be notified as soon as practicable by the Contracting Officer. 
 
Area of Evaluation: Non-Cost/Price Factors: 
 
Factor:  Technical Solution and Management Approach: The evaluation of an offeror?s Technical Solution and Management Approach shall be based on the offeror?s demonstrated ability to accomplish the requirements identified in Section C in a timely, comprehensive, and successful manner. In addition, the Government will assess the offeror?s understanding of the requirement and Government objectives. Offerors should clearly describe, through the submission of a detailed Statement of Work, their ability to achieve or exceed the required performance standards, establish quality assurance and maintain quality control and display their ability to manage The Micro-Compass Magnetometer (see General Note 1). 
 
Sub factor:  Quality Assurance and Quality Control: Evaluation of the offeror?s proposed quality assurance and quality control plan and/or procedures shall assess the degree to which the offeror?s planned quality assurance and quality control planned approach demonstrates their ability to successfully ensure proper completion of all required or proposed objectives. Offeror?s should include a description and method, including automated tools, reconcilable reports, and/or manual reports by which the requirements identified in Section C will be achieved or exceeded. 
 
Factor:  Past Performance and Past Experience: The Government will evaluate both an offeror?s ?Past Performance,? which relates to how well a contractor performs on projects, and its ?Past Experience,? which relates to whether or not the contractor has performed the same or similar work. The Government considers past performance and past experience as key indicators for predicting future performance.  Offerors with absence or no past performance history will not be disqualified; however; past performance is a critical factor in this solicitation. Offerors with no recent or relevant performance history will receive a neutral rating in this area of evaluation. A neutral rating could be considered less favorable than a favorable past performance score (see Attachment #2).
 
Sub factor:  Past Performance: For the purpose of evaluation of past performance, offerors shall define their business arrangements and relationships such as joint ventures, teaming partners (arrangements) and major subcontractors. Each offeror shall provide two recent, relevant examples of past performance.  Include the name of the project, point-of-contact names with phone number and email addresses, contract dollar amount and periods of performance. 
 
Area of Evaluation: Cost/Price Factors: 
 
The Government will conduct an appropriate cost/price analysis to determine whether the proposed cost/price is fair and reasonable. Cost or price becomes more significant between offers as the evaluated non-cost/price quotations of offerors reach equality (see General Note 2). 
 
Factor:  Cost Realism and Completeness: The Government will evaluate the degree to which the offeror?s proposed total cost/price is realistic for the work to be performed, reflects a clear understanding of the requirements, and if the offeror?s cost/price quotation is consistent with the various elements of the offeror?s technical proposal, considering the required level of effort. The offeror?s cost/price quotation will also be evaluated for completeness or responsiveness in addressing all Government requirements and/or proposed solutions. Cost/price must be submitted in sufficient detail to allow traceability and a complete analysis and evaluation of all elements. 
 
Offerors cost/price quotations will be compared against all aspects of the technical proposal and the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) to aid in determining cost/price reasonableness. Areas to be considered will include, but not be limited to: clarity of proposed cost/price elements, cost increases and/or decreases (over runs and/or under runs), experience on previous and/or current contracts, past/present cost savings and variation of cost/price as it relates to the IGCE, historical data and/or current market analysis. 
 
Factor:  Cost Reasonableness: Degree to which offeror?s proposed total cost/price is reasonable. The cost reasonable evaluation will take into consideration the results of the cost realism analysis and overall cost reasonableness based upon the total proposed prices and the degree to which the offeror?s proposed costs/prices indicate a clear understanding of and sound approach to meeting the objectives and requirements of this solicitation. The Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superior performance prospects of any quotation. 
 
The Government does not anticipate the need to request additional information after the closing date of the RFQ; however, clarifications and/or discussions may be required. Offerors should identify within their cost/price quotation and technical proposal, the appropriate point of contact(s) should clarifications or discussions become required. 
 
Late Quotation Provision: In order for your quotation to be considered for award by the Government, your quotation must be received by the Contracting Officer at the place and time specified, or it will be considered late and handled in accordance with FAR 15.208.

Note 1: The Government reserves the right to amend or cancel this solicitation and issue a new solicitation with respect to any individual item in the event quotations received and the Government's requirements indicate that alternative services, technical approaches or different quantities of services should be acquired. 
 
Note 2: Cost/price is a substantial evaluation criterion and offerors are hereby notified that upon an in-depth technical evaluation, appropriate scores will be assigned in non-price/non-cost areas. Cost/price scores will be assigned by formula. The lowest acceptable proposed cost/price to the Government will receive the highest cost/price score. The higher proposed costs/prices will receive proportionately lower scores. After adding each offeror's scores for cost/price and other areas, award will be made to the offeror which receives the highest total weighted score. However, the Government reserves the right to examine the technical point scores to determine whether a point differential between offerors represents any actual significant difference in technical merit. If it does not, then award may be made to an offeror with a lower cost or priced quotation, even though its total weighted point score is lower. Additionally, all offerors are hereby notified that an acceptable quotation with the lowest price may not be selected if award to a higher-priced quotation provides the Government a greater overall benefit. 
 
Note 3: The Government intends to award without discussions and reserves the right to award a contract immediately following the conclusion of the evaluation of initial offers without clarifications, discussions or negotiations if determined in the best interest of the Government by the Contracting Officer. Therefore, it is critical that each offeror be fully responsive to the solicitation, its provisions and submits its best quotation initially. 
 
Note 4: Proposal and/or quotation information submitted may be used to assess other areas of evaluation regarding cost/price and/or non-price factors. 
 
Note 5: Non-price factors will be reviewed to determine consistency with cost/price factors and to assess the offeror?s understanding of the overall project as outlined in this RFQ.

Note 6: Each offeror should strive to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government that the offeror has provided a technical solution and management approach that will ensure successful performance of all objectives. 
 
Note 7: The Government will conduct an assessment of risk for all quotations received. Risk is defined as the likelihood that the Offeror?s proposed solution would successfully meet the requirements identified. Evaluation of the Offeror?s ability to mange risks shall be demonstrated by detailing how each of the risks associated with this BCBL-H objective can be mitigated through corrective actions, work around alternatives, scheduling, program management alternatives, scheduling, costing, trending, impacts, etc. Risk will be evaluated throughout the evaluation process and will include but not be limited to considerations of management actions, company policies, knowledge and specific experience in the business management, systems engineering, software development and prototype development for the Micro Compass Magnetometer and any other method by which the offeror is able to demonstrate its ability to manage risks and reduce the impacts and/or costs to the Government. In addition, any identified risk within any aspect of an Offeror?s proposed solution will be analyzed as to its potential impact and/or cost to the BCBL-H mission and Government. 
***Amend 03 ? Clarification of Contract Type*** As described in Section L, FAR Clause 52.216-1, the Government contemplates award of a Fixed-Price Incentive (Firm Target) contract.  However, in response to the requirements identified in Section B of this solicitation, offerors may propose any of the following contract types: Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Cost Plus Award Fee, Cost Plus Incentive Fee, Firm Fixed Price, Fixed Price Incentive or any combination thereto.  
***Amend 04 ? Offer Due Date***Block 8 of the SF 1449 is hereby changed from 3:00 PM PDT on July 23, 2007 to 3:00 PM PDT on July 30, 2007.

Section C.	Statement of Work
C.1.		Background 
The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is an independent Federal agency established by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to regulate civilian use of nuclear materials.  NRC's primary mission is to protect the public health and safety, and the environment from the effects of radiation from nuclear reactors, materials, and waste facilities.  NRC also regulates these nuclear materials and facilities to promote the common defense and security.

The Office of Information Services (OIS) plans, directs, and oversees the NRC's information resources, including technology infrastructure and delivery of information management services, to meet the mission and goals of the agency.  It provides principal advice to the NRC Chairman to ensure that information technology (IT) is acquired and information resources across the agency are managed in a manner consistent with Federal information resources management (IRM) laws and regulations. The office assists senior management in recognizing where information technology can add value while improving NRC operations and service delivery and directs the implementation of a sound and integrated IT architecture to achieve NRC's strategic and IRM goals.  The office monitors and evaluates the performance of information technology and information management programs based on applicable performance measures and assesses the adequacy of IRM skills of the agency.  

To ensure that the implementation phases of OIS? varied programs and systems run smoothly, OIS Leadership is now focused on establishing and maintaining a productive change management program. Specifically, OIS is seeking to prepare managers who will lead employees confront change as well to build change management competency within the organization. This includes project managers and project team members.   

To facilitate this change management competency, OIS recognizes that there will have to be two separate courses carried out within the organization. The first course will be geared towards employees who are, or will be, responsible for managing change on a specific project or charged with building change management competency within their division.  This three-day intensive ?certification?  change management program will utilize an effective change management methodology, change management toolkit and change management pilot.  By the end of the three-day program, graduates will be able to help lead the organization through moderate and significant change.  

The second course will be a one-day program geared towards managers and supervisors who are helping their employees transition through change. This course will use a recognized change management methodology which will set the foundation of knowledge for effective change management within an organization. It will serve as a solid introduction to the change management process. 


C.2.		Objective
The objective of this contract is to have a Contractor provide on-site training to a maximum of 42 NRC staff (12 in Class (1) as described in Section B.1. and 30 in Class (2) as described in Section B.1. Class attendees will include Office Directors, Deputy Office Directors, Division Directors, Deputy Division Directors, Branch Chiefs, Section Chiefs, Team Leaders, and OIS staff.  

C.3.		Scope of Work
The Contractor shall provide on-site training to a maximum of 42 OIS staff (per Section B.1.).  This training shall fulfill the course objectives outlined in C.3.1 and address the issues outlined in C.3.2.  The training shall be conducted at the NRC headquarters office in Rockville, Maryland or at the NRC=s Professional Development Center in Bethesda, Maryland.  The addresses for these locations are as follows:
