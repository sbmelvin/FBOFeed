<SUBJECT>B--CRITICAL TECHNICAL REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF MMS SITE-SPECIFIC STUDIES TECHNIQUES
<SOLNBR>0106RP39799

<CONTACT>Rhonda Fernandez Contract Specialist 7037871348     rhonda.fernandez@mms.gov;
<DESC>NSL:  NT-04-06 The U. S. Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a requirement for a scientific/technical study to be performed, the objective of which is review and evaluate the appropriateness of the MMS marine mineral site-specific studies conducted to-date and determine if the current procedures/mechanisms and/or study design should be modified to yield information which may be more scientifically appropriate or provide a greater cost/benefit relative to the assessment of environmental impacts of offshore dredging operations on the biological and physical environments.. The prospective contractor will organize a Scientific Review Team (SRT) comprised of recognized scientific/technical experts in the fields of offshore numerical computer wave modeling, physical oceanography, coastal sediment transport, benthic and fisheries biology, and offshore dredging technology in order to review and critique the methodologies employed by the MMS Marine Minerals Program (MMP) site-specific biological/physical studies conducted to-date, as well as the studies currently in-progress. This is to be accomplished by reviewing and analyzing completed environmental studies reports and contracts/work statements/technical proposals for ongoing studies. This will be done in light of MMS' legal responsibilities to assess the possible effects of dredging operations conducted under a lease/negotiated agreement issued by the Agency.  Following the review, the SRT will determine and recommend appropriate measures which can be implemented to mitigate any apparent or perceived weaknesses in studies approach and will be required to present the results of the review to the MMS at a pre-arranged meeting. The Contractor will be required to prepare a scientific/technical report containing all relevant information pertaining to the studied review and the study modifications recommended. The format and organization for the manuscript will be agreed upon between the Program Manager (PM) and the MMS-COTR prior to preparation. A draft final report shall be submitted to the MMS for review prior to preparation of the final document.  The prospective contractor will also be required to prepare a Technical Summary in the format prescribed by MMS after completion and acceptance of the final report. It is expected that the work effort will take a total of 14 months.  The cost of this effort is Not to Exceed $100,000. The MMS Leasing Division, and specifically, the Division's Marine Minerals Branch has been focusing on integrating geologic and environmental information, developed through partnerships with coastal States and contracted or cooperative study efforts, to identify suitable Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) sand deposits for beach and coastal restoration and to provide needed environmental information in regards to environmental management of these resources.  The MMS has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf.  Public Law 103-426, enacted October 31, 1994, gave the MMS the authority to convey, on a noncompetitive basis, the rights to OCS sand, gravel, or shell resources for shore protection, beach or wetlands restoration projects, or for use in construction projects funded in whole or part or authorized by the Federal Government.   Offshore sand dredging for beach nourishment projects employ hydraulic dredges almost exclusively and are normally either cutterhead or hopper-type dredges.  Regardless of the dredging method employed, however, the process could potentially result in adverse effects on various components of the marine or coastal environment if the possible effects are not properly assessed pre-dredging, and if mitigation, in the form of area avoidance or engineering modifications is not employed properly.  As a Federal Agency, the MMS is required to ensure that, prior to any dredging operation on the OCS, all mandates of applicable environmental legislation (i.e., NEPA) are met.  These mandates require that prior to the initiation of a dredging operation the potential environmental effects must be analyzed using the best available scientific and technical information. In an effort to meet those mandates, the MMS Marine Minerals Branch has been contracting for and conducting site-specific biological and physical environmental studies since 1997. The physical efforts have focused on the use of numerical wave modeling, coupled with sediment transport analyses to assess the effects on the local wave climate and sediment transport regime as a result of possible dredging operations and the removal of sand from within identified Federal sand borrow sites. The biological investigations provide an initial characterization of biological conditions at offshore borrow sites prior to any dredging activity. This information has then been used to infer potential effects on biological organisms and communities, including interpretations of potential rates of recolonization.of these communities. This approach to site-specific studies has been modified only slightly since the inception of the site-specific efforts. In the last several years, a fisheries component has been established to provide information useful during the required essential fisheries habitat consultations with MOAA-Fisheries. Since 1997 the MMS MMP has grown considerably and the number of negotiated sand lease agreements issued has increased from about one per year to four or more per year. The amount of sand being conveyed has changed from on average 1 million cubic yards per project to as much as 4 million cubic yards per project. Additionally the frequency and number of times a specific OCS borrow area has been used has changed.  Initial requests were evaluated based on the likelihood that an OCS borrow site would be used by one entity over a cycle of once every 4-6 years. Recent requests now illustrate a trend of borrow areas being accessed on average every 2 years and in many cases by multiple entities. This rapid growth has created new environmental concerns and increased the emphasis on adequately assessing environmental impacts from dredging operations, especially over a long time period and as a result of numerous dredging events in the same area.  MMP site-specific studies have not changed significantly since first being conducted in 1997. While site-specific studies, as currently conducted, are sufficient to meet legal mandates, they may no longer be entirely appropriate at this present time. It is imperative that these studies are carried out in a manner that provide the best information for answering environmental concerns and provide the best synergy with other MMP environmental studies. Pursuant to FAR Part 19.303, "Determining North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and size standards".  "The Contracting Officer shall determine the appropriate NAICS code and related small business size standard and include them in solicitations above the micro-threshold." The Contracting Officer has determined that the following NAICS code is appropriate for this requirement: 541710 - This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in conducting research and experimental development in the physical, engineering, and life sciences, such as agriculture, electronics, environmental, biology, botany, biotechnology, computers, chemistry, food, fisheries, forest geology, health, mathematics, medicine, oceanography, pharmacy, physics, veterinary, and other allied subjects. This is a 100% small business set aside, being issued in accordance with FAR Part 13 - SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES and FAR Part 19 - SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS.  Interested parties must email their request for a copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP) to Rhonda Fernandez, Contract Specialist, Rhonda.Fernandez@mms.gov; fax: 703-787-1041, by 4:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Savings Standard Time, Monday, July 5, 2006.

This two (2) day Industry Day meeting will be held at The Aerospace Corporation, Bldg A-8 basement auditorium(to be scheduled), 2350 East El Segundo Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. 

A 1st Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for TSAT Space is scheduled to be released in Sep 06, a 2nd DRFP in 1QFY07, and a final RFP in 3QFY07.  This will be followed by a full and open competition for the D&P phase with proposals due in 3QFY07, a selection of a single contractor in 1QFY08, and a first launch in FY14.  The Government expects three more industry days before the final RFP release, after the 1st and 2nd draft RFP releases and following Systems Design Review (SDR), Sep 06, Dec 06 and Mar 07, respectively.


To help meet TSAT Block 1 and 2 deployment schedules, the TSAT Program Office is soliciting 1) acquisition approaches and potential award fee incentives to reduce risk and increase confidence in systems performance and in the program cost and schedule; 2) lessons learned and best practices; 3) system integration initiatives; and 4) feedback on the program risks, candidate structure for the evaluation, statement of objectives, compliance document list, contract data deliverables list, Technical Requirements Documents (TRD) and work breakdown structure (WBS).  Working copies of these documents will be released on 19 Jun 06 and made available on the TSAT Space Bidders Library.  All contractors may submit white papers to the Government that address the four areas identified in this paragraph.  In addition, as an attachment to the white paper, contractors may provide a high level MS Project schedule with no more than 100 task IDs defining key activities required to first launch. Each task should be linked with predecessors and successors, defining critical path. In addition, each task ID should have pessimistic, realistic and optimistic durations attached.  In general, task durations should fall into a range of 1 to 6 months although there can be exceptions.

All interested parties are invited to attend Day 1 when the government team will present program overview and objectives, the acquisition strategy, system and segment requirements, and required interaction with the other segments.  The TSAT Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) segment will brief on the system requirements and TSAT Mission Operations System (TMOS) segment will brief the status of TMOS acquisition.  Day 2 will be used to meet individually with potential prime contractors who formally request a one-on-one session with the Government.  These potential prime contractors are required to submit the above mentioned white paper along with a separate list of discussions questions for the one-on-one session, along with a statement of capability requirements.   The Government will only provide information during these sessions that is equally available to all interested parties.  Following Day 2, the collective answers provided during the one-on-one sessions will be posted on the MILSATCOM TSAT Space Bidders Library website.  The white paper and questions should be less then twelve (12) pages and be submitted not later then 1200PDT on 26 Jun 06.  All discussion questions shall be submitted to SMC/MCK (Space Segment), 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808, Attn: Lakisha Jefferson, Contracting Officer.  Discussion questions should be marked appropriately.  Each portion marked proprietary or competition sensitive must include sufficient justification.

<DESC>FISC Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia announces its intent to issue a sole source request for proposal to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) for the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) for biomedical, psychological, and operational research services in support of the Lab’s research and development mission.  SAIC is the incumbent contractor and is considered the only source capable of providing the highly specialized services.  It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, since only SAIC possesses the required knowledge of NSMRL key programs, and has the requisite research background and capabilities to continue the on-going support of the programs due to the extensive acumen in the respective research fields that is required of each researcher.  Current SAIC research efforts at the lab do not have a defined completion point.  Various projects and studies build on past research performed and are the basis of future projects and studies; thus, there is an integral need for a company with the corporate knowledge, research skills, and personnel resources that SAIC possesses.  The services will be provided through the award of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract for a base period of performance of one year with four one-year option periods.  All questions should be directed to Leanne Hanger at leanne.hanger@navy.mil.  Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for Human Space Flight Mission Services that includes training and operational support at two unique facilities:  the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) and the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility (SVMF).	The support required includes the support of suited astronauts and other subjects in a neutrally buoyant environment; maintenance and upgrade of complex mechanical, hydraulic, fluid, and electrical systems; design and manufacture of space vehicle mockups; and operation of two complex facilities.   NASA/JSC intends to purchase these services from Raytheon Technical Services Company through an extension of the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL)/Space Vehicle Mockup Facility (SVMF) Operations Contract (NSOC), NAS9-02102.  The proposed period of performance for the NSOC extension is April 1, 2008, through September 30, 2010, plus a 1-year option for services through September 30, 2011.	 Training activities at the NBL are critical to the continued and uninterrupted support required during the remaining Space Shuttle Flights and International Space Station (ISS) assembly sequence.  Unique requirements for certified and highly trained safety, utility, and reconfiguration divers exist.  The certification process for a new diver requires at least a 6-month time commitment, and any turnover in the staffing level would be unacceptable due to the potential interruption to the flight schedule.	Additionally, complex systems including life support systems, breathing gas systems, Robotic Manipulator Systems, and Water Treatment Systems are operated, maintained, and upgraded by highly qualified and skilled technicians and engineers with extensive experience in the individual systems.  Competition of the Space Shuttle and ISS space operations requirements could also lead to the loss of knowledgeable personnel introducing risk to the Space Shuttle and ISS programs.  The turmoil and uncertainty involved in a contract transition would result in the workforce being distracted from the job at hand because of the uncertainties inherent during a competition (e.g. concern about employment, benefits, and new management) and disruptions caused by new company policies.  Any disruption to these activities could also result in a delay to the flight and assembly sequence which would be unacceptable.	All activities at the NBL are safety and life critical, and the safety risk to the Government associated with transitioning a new contractor can not be accepted at this time due to the criticality of timing and support requirements.  Support at the SVMF requires the operation, maintenance, and upgrade of approximately 30+ medium and high fidelity space vehicle mockups.  The mockups must be readied for instructor and crew activities on a very tight schedule, and to exacting standards.  Any deviation to configuration can result in negative crew training, and the inability of a mission to be performed in a timely and safe manner.  The loss of configuration knowledge and skills due to a contract transition could result in an unacceptable delay to the flight and assembly sequence. NASA plans to use the Space Shuttle to complete the assembly of the ISS and maintain the commitments made to the international partners.  The ISS assembly schedule is tightly constrained with the Space Shuttle retirement in 2010, or earlier.  The schedule margin that would be required for a competitive selection and potentially incorporating a new space operations contractor into the program would not support the ISS assembly schedule.  Competition of the Space Shuttle and ISS space operations requirements could also lead to the loss of knowledgeable personnel introducing risk to both the Space Shuttle and ISS programs.  Because of these considerations, including the unacceptable costs and delays that would be incurred to conduct a competition and/or select a different contractor, the potential benefits from competition do not justify accepting these substantial risks to the Space Shuttle and ISS programs.  However, it is the Government’s intention to compete this effort following this critical extension period of performance and once our requirements are better understood. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 20, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), supports a comprehensive extramural research program focused on the prevention and control of diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents (with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus).  This includes basic research, such as studies of microbial biology and physiology; applied research, including the development of vaccines, therapeutics and medical diagnostics; as well as clinical studies to evaluate experimental drugs and vaccines.

Recent threats of the use of infectious agents as biological weapons have generated increased concern for the safety of the general American populace.  Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis) is the etiologic agent of anthrax.  The ability to generate high titer anthrax spores using basic microbiological techniques combined with the ability of these agents to be disseminated by aerosolization, has made anthrax a primary bioterrorist and military threat.  With the deliberate exposure of citizens of the United States to B. anthracis spores in 2001, there is an urgent need to stockpile appropriate and effective medical countermeasures to protect all U.S. citizens from the morbidity and mortality associated with infection from these instruments of terror.  

The NIAID has a requirement for the advanced development and testing of anthrax vaccine candidates which build upon the second generation vaccine, resulting in properties desirable for a biodefense vaccine to be stored in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).  These properties include long-term stability (i.e., three years or longer) at room temperature, the ability to generate a protective immune response in one or two doses, and the ability to safely self-administer and/or rapidly inoculate into large numbers of people.  Anthrax vaccine candidates eligible for support under this solicitation shall possess any one or all of the characteristics listed above while maintaining a superior safety profile to the currently U.S. licensed anthrax vaccine.  Novel formulations/final vaccine presentation, new delivery platforms, adjuvants other than aluminum, and inclusion of antigens in addition to protective antigen (PA) may be components of candidate vaccines.

 
The project involves:  (1) manufacture and testing of anthrax vaccine candidates possessing any one or all of the characteristics listed above; (2) production of vaccine components and final product at pilot-lot scale; (3) characterization and testing including a stability program; (4) one or more pre-clinical safety studies required for the filing of an Investigational New Drug application (IND); and (5) non-clinical aerosol spore challenge studies using rabbit and non-human primate models. 

The Request for Proposal will include Mandatory Qualification Criteria that must be met at the time of receipt of the original proposal submission and they are as follows: Documentation must be provided to verify that the proposed anthrax vaccine candidate meets the following minimum development status criteria:  a) As purified Protective antigen, (PA) has been shown to be efficacious against B. anthracis spore challenge in animal models, the proposed vaccine must contain a PA component; b) The PA component may be proteinaceous or nucleotide-encoded; c) Should the final vaccine presentation/inoculation strategy include a novel device, a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) or a Premarket Notification Form 510K must be currently filed with the FDA, and documentation provided in the Technical Proposal; and d) Data and results from a proof-of-concept study of the vaccine candidate in an anthrax spore challenge animal model which has demonstrated vaccine efficacy must be provided in the Technical Proposal.  This may be in the form of a final study report or a peer-reviewed publication.

If a novel device for vaccine delivery is proposed, contract funds may be utilized to suitably formulate the candidate vaccine for the device; however, funds may not be used for developing a device.  This RFP will require that a Pre-market Approval Application (PMA) or a Premarket Notification Form 510K must be currently filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for such devices and documentation provided in the Technical Proposal. 

Potential offerors must also demonstrate and document the following in their technical proposal:  (1) the vaccine candidate development status relating to established Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) pilot-scale production of clinical grade material suitable for use in Phase 1/2 clinical trials; (2) justification that further development of the proposed candidate vaccine as it relates to the objectives of this RFP (improved safety profile, rapid and robust titers in no more than two doses, elimination of cold chain/long-term stability, and ease of delivery for use in an emergency event) is warranted, while maintaining an improved safety/reactogenicity profile over the current licensed vaccine and at least equivalent efficacy; (3) documentation that the candidate contains, in part, a PA component; (4) demonstration of the availability and adequacy of facilities for cGMP drug substance (DS) and cGMP final drug product (FDP) manufacturing at pilot-lot manufacturing scale. For this RFP, pilot-scale DS fermentation is defined as a minimum of 30 liter working volume and/or sufficient DS to fill 2,000 doses of FDP. FDP is defined as a minimum of 2,000 final doses per single lot run. Potential sources proposing methodology for DS production other than fermentation must provide documentation to indicate that current yield is of equivalent quantity as above requirements.  Pilot-lot scale processes must be readily transferable to large scale manufacture; (5) previous experience in developing and conducting non-clinical development plans to evaluate safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates that includes the conduct of all FDA required Investigational New Drug application (IND) enabling studies; and (6) previous experience in developing and executing clinical development plans to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of vaccine candidates.

It is anticipated that one or more cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a three-year period of performance beginning on or about June 08, 2007, In addition, the contract will contain two Options.  If executed, and will require the contractor to design and conduct a Phase 1 dose escalating clinical trial in healthy subjects ages 18 to 40 and up to two Phase 2 clinical trials in healthy subjects ages 18 to 55.  It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows:  13 FTE for Base Year 1 & 2; Reduced to 7.55 FTEs for Base Year 3; 2.1 FTEs for Year 3--Option 1; 2.1 FTEs per year in Option 2 (Years 4-7).  The Option periods could increase the contract value and extend the contract by up to four years.   

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about June 19, 2006, and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Ingenuity Systems, 1700 Seaport Blvd. Redwood City, CA 94063 for the acquisition of four Ingenuity Pathways Analysis concurrent license for one year with unlimited user accounts. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis Software is a web-based application that enables researchers to explore, understand, and discover relevant networks significant to their research results. Using a researcher's gene or protein dataset in combination with  Ingenuity's genome-scale knowledge base, the application generates multiple biologic networks with an associated functional analysis to facilitate biological understanding of the dataset. Specifically it: A. supports genomic and proteomic data analysis; B. enables discovery of novel genes, proteins  and interactions (canonical) pathways; C. allows expansion of pathways to identify putative targets; D. contains manually curated pathways from full-text scientific literature (Not just abstracts); E. allows comparisons of 2 groups of pathways; F. allows user creation of a pathway from a set of  genes; G. develops pathways from an input genelist on the "fly", meaning it develops a pathway from just that set of genes and no others. This is a unique Pathway Analysis software that allows researchers to view their data in terms of networks of pathways in an "interactomic fashion". There are no  pathways analysis packages on the market today that contains the depth of annotated pathways as provided by Ingenuity Pathway Software. This software is presently being used to support an ongoing research project at EPA. As such, it is required for continuity of data analyses for the project.  In  order to ensure data compatibility and accuracy the circumstance permitting is FAR 13.106(B) "only one source reasonably available".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to  provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.   Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 10 days after the date of this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC-E105-02),RTP Procurement Operations Division,  Research Triangle Park, NC 27711,  by fax (919)541-1075 or by e-mail at smith.pamela@epa.gov . No telephone request will not be honored.

These jars are used to store tissues collected in the field for long term archival and for contaminants analysis.  The jars must be identical, as there are 2 facilities that utilize the jars for analyzing and results.  Data compatibility would be compromised if other jars were used.  The racking systems (boxes and tubes) have been specially created for the dimensions of the jars to fit inside each rack type.  Savillex Corporation is the sole manufacturer and sole distributor of the PFA Teflon Jars. 

No solicitation package will be issued.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by March 27, 2006, will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>:    This is a NOTICE OF INTENT to negotiate on a sole source basis.  SSA intends to negotiate with eiStream WMS, Inc., 296 Concord Road, Billerica, MA 01821, for
software maintenance and upgrades for eiStream Enhanced Archive Manager software products, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 â€œOnly one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirementsâ€.   These software products are used to support SSAâ€™s nationwide National Imaging/Paperless PSC process.  SSA uses eiStream Enhanced Archive Manager (small) which provides magnetic storage up to 500-gigabyte capacity, and eiStream Enhanced Archive Manager (large) which provides magnetic storage up to 1 terabyte capacity to provide archives of work items for storage and retrieval to magnetic disk. This eiStream paperless software solution supports 8 sites, approximately 12,000 users nationwide, processes approximately 281,714 transactions daily and houses over 91 million electronic documents, of which 76 million are archived to magnetic disk.  SSA is considering establishing a Blanket Purchase Agreement for eiStream Enhanced Archive Manager software maintenance and upgrades for the period October 01, 2006 through September 30, 2011.  SSA currently owns 12 licenses consisting of the following eiStream software products:  9 Enhanced Archive Manager (small) which provides magnetic storage up to 500-gigabyte capacity; 3 Enhanced Archive Manager (large) which provides magnetic storage up to 1 terabyte capacity.  All services and maintenance would be carried out at any SSA designated site. In addition to allowing SSA to continue to leverage its current investment in eiStream Enhanced Archive Manager software products, the contract will provide ongoing maintenance support, a vehicle for acquiring additional licenses at a reduced rate, and upgrades through the term of the contract.  eiStream is the only source known to the government that is capable of providing upgrades and maintenance support for these proprietary software products.  This is a Notice of Intent only, not a solicitation.  Requests for solicitation will not be acknowledged.  When responding to this announcement, respondents should refer to eiStream Software Upgrades and Maintenance.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill this requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command (ARDEC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis to award purchase order (PO) to DIT-MCO International,  located in Kansas City, MO, for six (6) each computer controlled automatic  circuit analyzer systems.  Delivery to Picatinny, NJ 90 days after PO award.   The National Guard Bureau (NGB) soldiers possess training using the DIT-MCO  model 2115 hardware and its software applications. The US Government currently  possesses software that is proprietary to the DIT-MCO model 2115 test system  named "Test LinkÂ®". The suite consists of proprietary application programs.   It is also imperative to maintain hardware commonality to match the hundreds  of other identical units already in use.  Procuring the same product will  facilitate commonality and the result will save the US Government considerable  time and money in term of training and equipment maintenance.  DIT-MCO  International Inc. will only license their software per unit sold by them.  This action is based on other than full and open competition procedures  utilizing FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A).  All responsible sources, however, may  submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency.  Purchase Order  award is anticipated on or about 16 June 2006.  See Numbered Note 22.

DESCRIPTION OF REVISIONS:

1.	REVISE PART B. STATEMENT OF QUALIFICATIONS, CRITERIA 1, EXPERIENCE, THIRD COLUMN, FIRST SENTENCE AS FOLLOWS: 

DELETE THE WORDING:
“MINIMUM REQUIREMENT:
AT LEAST TWO OF THESE DESIGN-BUILD PROJECTS SHALL HAVE HAD A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT VALUE GREATER THAN $5,000,000. “

AND REPLACE WITH:

“MINIMUM REQUIREMENT:
 AT LEAST TWO OF THESE DESIGN-BUILD PROJECTS SHALL HAVE HAD A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT VALUE GREATER THAN $5,000,000 EACH OR STRONGLY RELATE TO THE LASO OFFICE BUILDING IN SIZE AND FUNCTIONALITY."

2.	IN ADDITION TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT IN THE COVER LETTER AND AMENDMENT NO.1 THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IS ADDED:
“THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS AN APPROVED LINE-ITEM FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FEDERAL BUILDING.  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NO APPROVAL FOR CONSIDERATION OF ANY 3RD PARTY TYPE FINANCING/CONSTRUCTION.  CONSIDERATION IS BEING GIVEN TO BOTH ON-SITE AND OFF-SITE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION.”

This procurement is for the Design-Build of NSSB Phase II LASO Office Building.  This building has been sited in Los Alamos, New Mexico at TA-3 (near Bikini Atoll and West Jemez Road).  The building will be approximately 22,000 square feet, single story, and will include offices, conference rooms, kitchenettes, and storage space. Approximately 120 parking spaces are included.

The respondent will coordinate with the County of Los Alamos in the selection and development of a construction site.  Financial arrangements for the land, if leased would have to be contracted between NNSA and Respondent or Los Alamos County.  The construction of the building would be procured by the University with the same design requirements at either site.
 
Respondents can either elect to be qualified for the TA-3 Wellness Center Site, the Town Site, or Both.  Respondents must specify in their RFQ response which qualification option they are selecting.

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: Architect-Engineer services are required for award of up to three Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IDIQ) to support the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. The contract will be for a 12 month period and will have options to extend the contract for four additional periods of 12 months each. An option period may be exercised when the contract amounts for the base period or preceding option period has been exhausted or nearly exhausted. Contract will be firm fixed priced.

The firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently. Task orders will be assigned based on the A-E's workload, geographic area, specialized experience, customer satisfaction, and project requirements. The concentration of work will be for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, but may be used anywhere within the contiguous United States. Contracts may be issued up to one year after the selection is made and will be issued based on the order of ranking of the firms by the selection board.  The number of contracts that will be issued will be dependent on the amount of work that will be required. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. 2. SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS: If the selected firm is a large business concern, a subcontracting plan with the final fee proposal will be required. A minimum of 40% of the total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with small business concerns. At least 15% of total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), including Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions, 8% with women-owned small businesses (WOSB),   3% shall be placed with Hubzone Small Business (HubSB), and 3% with veteran-owned small businesses. This plan is not required with this submittal.  3. PROJECT INFORMATION: Since opening in April, 1993, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has hosted over two million visitors annually. The Museum's exhibits and public programs are housed in a 258,000 square foot building, which in many ways evokes the Museum's subject matter. The Museum's staff offices are located primarily adjacent to the Museum in the Ross Administrative Center, a 45,000 square foot building which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in leased office space elsewhere in the District of Columbia. The Museum also has a remote storage and conservation facility outside of the District of Columbia. It has become apparent that modifications need to be made to accommodate the Museum's expanding collections and developing programs.  There are also a number of maintenance issues caused by the Museum's great success which need to be addressed. The Museum's Division of Operations is looking to issue IDIQ contracts with firms who will be able to make these adjustments in a manner which is architecturally compatible with either the Museum's design aesthetic, or with the historic fabric of the Ross Administrative Center. These contracts will be overseen by the Museum Architect.  As the projects are expected to range considerably in size, scope, and public visibility, it is anticipated that the Museum will establish contracts with multiple firms, at least one of which has an emphasis on historic preservation and materials conservation. The following services are expected to be contracted for as part of these contracts: complete design services including the preparation of construction contract drawings, specifications and cost estimates, both preliminary and final; site investigations; planning studies; preparation of presentation drawings, models, and sample boards; programming; space layouts; tenant space plans; interior design, including furniture and finish sselection; shop drawing reviews; value engineering; construction services; post-construction services; and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government. The firm may be required to provide construction phase and other services which may include preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, and commissioning/start-up/fit-up design support. Some projects will be initiated as part of this contract, and flow from programming and schematic design through construction documentation. Other projects will be based upon schematic designs provided by the Museum Architect. The firm or firms selected shall have either in-house expertise or consultants with expertise in the following areas:  architectural conservation, museum planning, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, structural engineering, fire protection engineering, and cost estimating.  Some projects may require specialized expertise in graphic design, architectural lighting, historic preservation, and architectural materials conservation. Additional required expertise may be needed for a specific project, as required by the Government.  The firm or firms selected, and their consultants, shall be licensed to practice their respective disciplines in the District of Columbia. As such, they shall be familiar with all applicable codes, as well as with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards.  They shall also be familiar with the Federal Acquisition Regulations, particularly as it relates to the selection of furniture and interior design elements. They shall also be familiar with the procedures and requirements of the National Capitol Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, as well with as the Section 106 Historic Review Process. In addition to traditional architectural presentation techniques, architectural drawings done as part of this contract shall be submitted in electronic format which is compatible with AutoCAD 2006, and done according to the guidelines established by the American Institute of Architects. Some of the task orders issued under this contract may require background checks of the firm's personnel, including criminal background checks. In addition, for some task orders, the firm may need to submit a SF-85 and sign a non-disclosure agreement.  3. SELECTION CRITERIA: See Note 24 for general A-E selection process.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of TRUST for Integrated Circuits. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems. Specifically excluded is research, which primarily results in evolutionary improvement upon existing state-of-the-art. 

Largely because of global economic pressures, fabrication of advanced integrated circuits is migrating to foreign foundries.  In addition, business models are increasingly driven by commercial, rather then military, demand. Dedicated facilities cannot provide the performance, variety and volume of microchips that the DoD needs. These trends have raised concern regarding U.S. weapons systems reliance on high performance microchips and potential vulnerabilities to these systems caused by malicious manipulation of hardware and software processes that might render these vital systems inoperable at some future time. This situation is true for both ASIC and COTS parts. 

Furthermore, there are issues with protecting intellectual property and military secrets as they are often embedded in the design of microcircuits, and the details of this design are often needed by the manufacturer in the fabrication process. 

Finally, there are also issues associated with protecting intellectual property and military secrets after the systems are deployed,  especially in circumstances where systems and components are lost, captured or are no longer under U.S. control and subject to reverse engineering over a sustained period of time. 

This new DARPA initiative is being considered to address the above issues and others that have been identified in the DSB study on High Performance Microchip Supply [http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2005-02-HPMS_Report_Final.pdf]. The report addresses design, the use of advanced design tools, fabrication, packaging, testing, and monitoring of high performance IC’s within critical systems and subsystems. Specific areas of interest to DARPA include TRUST, Information Leakage and Anti-Tamper; although the primary interest is TRUST. DARPA will also engage in a Metrics-for-TRUST task focused on measuring the value of DARPA investments in novel technologies. To be clear, DARPA is only interested in issues related to TRUSTed Integrated Circuits and is not interested in proposals pertaining to issues concerning printed circuit boards or the general area of malicious software.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Multiple awards are anticipated. Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort. The technical POC for this effort is Dean R. Collins, Deputy Director-MTO, Phone 571-218-4650, Fax 703-696-2206, Email dean.collins@darpa.mil.

GENERAL INFORMATION
Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA 06-40,TRUST for Integrated Circuits, Proposer Information Pamphlet," Proposer Information Pamphlet" which provides further information on technical areas of interest to DARPA. This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.gov website: http://www.grants.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below. Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed. 

In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, offerors are strongly encouraged to submit white papers in advance of full proposals. An original and five (5) copies of the white paper and two (2) electronic copies (i.e., two (2) separate disks) of the white paper [in PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a CD-ROM] should be submitted. Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-40, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy __ of 2. The white paper (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-40) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, June 30, 2006. White papers received after this time and date may not be reviewed. Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal, which may differ from the originally published date below. 

Offerors not submitting white papers must submit an original and five (5) copies of the full proposal and two (2) electronic copies (i.e., two (2) separate disks) of the full proposal [in PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a CD-ROM]. Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-40, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy __ of 2. The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-40) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Monday, August 21, 2006, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and Grants.Gov. Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposals may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds. This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 06-40 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA. No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received and to make awards without discussion. In the event that DARPA desires to award only portions of a proposal, negotiations will be opened with that offeror. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only". Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for these organizations' participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Trusted Integrated Circuits.

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a white paper or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred. DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 06-40. Proposals and white papers may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded. DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

DARPA/MTO will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the bidder believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance on a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. If you choose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA. The primary point of contact for classified responses is Darrin Smith (703-526-4102, 703-807-1779 fax, darin.smith@darpa.mil) who should be contacted prior to the submitting a classified white paper or proposal.

Q13.	Does the Presolicitation Notice replace the Sources Sought Notice that was released on January 9, 2006 "N00421-06-R-0027 - NAVAIR IT/IM Services?
A13.	No, however, this solicitation is a result of the N00421-06-R-0027 Sources Sought Notice.

Q14.	 I just saw the announcement for this opportunity on Fedbizopps and just wanted to clarify that this was a different requirement than the NAVAIR IT IM (N0042106R0027).  
A14.	Yes, they are different requirements as addressed in Q1 & A1.

Q15.	Still a little confused as N0042106R0027 is also advertised on Fedbizopps as a Total Small Business set aside.  Are both these requirements going to be Small business set asides? 
A15.	When N00421-06-R-0027 was on Fedbizopps previously it was for “Sources Sought” information.  The sources sought was used to give Small Business Administration (SBA) a fair opportunity to provide their capability statement to determine if Small Business could rationally provide the services.  The outcome determined that these areas as identified in N00421-06-R-0057 would be earmarked and set aside for Small Businesses.  Based on the sources sought research it was determined that only the efforts for N00421-06-R-0057 would condusive for Small Business set aside.

Q16.	The presolicitation notice states "some tasks to be performed will require that personnel possess a Top Secret Security Clearance", for planning purposes can you indicate what percent of the tasks will require Top Secret Clearances?
A16.	The percentage of task that will require Top Secret clearance is 5%, which will be approximately 4% of the personnel under this contract.

Q17.	Who do we contact to obtain information via FOIA?
A17.	Please contact the Freedom of Information Act in writing at:
Office of Counsel/Legal (ATTN FOIA Coordinator)
	Bldg 435, Suite A

Q18. Will the bidders list be published?
A18.	Yes, there will be a bidders list published.

Q19.Will there be an industry day?
A19.	No, there will not be an industry day.

We feel we have adequately addressed all questions asked from this pre solicitation synopsis.  Therefore, no further questions will be entertained at this time.  However, there will be time for questions at time of the RFP release.

No late proposals will be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 81233   Q:  1.)Can you please provide more detail regarding the term ?reflective lumenators?.  Does this reference the ?pull down tabs? in some way? 2.)The RFQ requests that ?Federal Agent? be silkscreened on the front right pull down tab in gold.  Gold is not available in a  reflective ink, so this appears to be in conflict with the request for reflective panels.  Can you please clarify. A:  Reflective luminators (panels) - a pull down tab (back side) which reflects during night time hours when a flashlight or headlights shine upon the panel.  The silk screen letters  (or embroidery) of Federal Agent should be able to be identiifed for the safety of our law enforcement officers.  If gold does not come in a reflective color - please indicate which colors are available in fluourescent style.

<DESC>I MADE A MISTAKE ON FRIDAY, 2 JUN 06. I DID NOT SAVE A MODIFICATION TO THE SOLICITATION CORRECTLY. DUE DATE IS NOW EXTENDED TO 7 JUN 06. THERE ARE TWO QUESTION AND ANSWER DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE TO DOWNLOAD. PLEASE REVIEW. THE PERIOD FOR ASKING QUESTIONS IS NOW CLOSED.

In order to build the capacity development of the Iraqi Civil Defence Corps (ICDC) requires that fire fighters receive training in the handling and disposal of HAZMAT (Hazardous Materials). These trained fire fighters will also receive train-the-trainer classes so they can oversee the training of other fire personnel in HAZMAT handling procedures. The ICDC is establishing better policies and procedures for the handling and disposal of HAZMAT. The fire fighters who attend this HAZMAT training will be able to conduct classes at the outlying fire houses to the other fire personnel. This capacity building is essential to reduce casualties among the fire fighters as well as the civilians at the scene of fire incidents (car bombs, chemical fires, and unidentified material spills). See the attached SOW for more information. The evaluation criteria, in descending order of importance, will be past experience with providing HAZMAT training classes that meet U.S. standards, technical capability to provide this course in Baghdad Iraq, and price. Quotes are to be submitted electronically to 1Lt Francis Navarro at francis.navarro@pco-iraq.net.

<RESPDATE>061906
<CONTACT>Connie  Houpt, 405/954-7820
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at the FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for cataloging services.  The contractor shall provide all services, personnel, material, supplies, labor, and equipment (computers and associated accessories) required to perform management of the FAA's material inventory and distribution system.  This includes materiel, shop services, and engineering support of Agency commitments for the establishment, operation, and maintenance of field facilities and field offices, both foreign and domestic.  National Stock Numbers (NSNs) are required for stocking in FAA's facilities and also for accountability. NSN assignments are known as "Cataloging."  The FAA will not furnish government-furnished equipment, as the equipment is not unique to the tasks.   The Statement of Work (SOW) is provided as Attachment 1. Currently, the FAA Logistics Center has an Interagency Agreement with Defense Logistics Information Service in Battle Creek, Michigan, to perform their cataloging services.  That agreement will expire next year.  The FAA has an on-going requirement for these services. This SIR is to request information that will enable the FAA to make a screening decision to determine qualified firms that have the ability to perform these services.  The FAA reserves the right to add incumbent contractors and/or other sources which meet the criteria and have performed satisfactorily on previous procurements.  Accordingly, it has been determined that only firms meeting the following minimum requirements will be solicited: (1) Contractors must employee catalogers who possess previous (within the last three years) cataloging experience.  Provide documentation, such as a list of contracts (names, addresses, telephone numbers of government or industry) officially having knowledge of your company's performance to support that your company has provided these services. (2) Catalogers are required to have been trained in accordance with DoD 4100.39-M (www.dlis.dla.mil) Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) cataloging procedures in all cataloging functions as the tasks must be submitted into FLIS.  The basis for this requirement is because the Legislation of the 82nd Congress of the United States of America passed the "Defense Cataloging and Standardization Act" and Congress later determined that the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) in Battle Creek, Michigan, was to be the repository of the Federal Cataloging System and is the only Government Agency that can assign National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and Commercial and Government Entity Codes (CAGE), which are used by all Government Agencies.  Prospective contractors shall provide proof of training. 	(3) Complete/submit the Business Declaration form (Attachment 2) with your response.  The successful contractor will be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award of contract. Requirement is for a base year and includes option provisions to renew for four additional 1-year periods, to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA.  The proposed contract will incorporate AMS Clause 3.2.4-35, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract, and 3.2.4-34, Option To Extend Services. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be a Labor Hour-type contract. The date and time for receipt of responses is 2:00 p.m. CST, Monday, June 19, 2006, (facsimile responses are permitted).  If all requested information is not furnished, the contractor's response may be determined unacceptable; therefore, not considered as one of the qualified companies.  If you have questions, contact Connie Houpt at (405) 954-7820. Submit responses to the following address: 		FAA, NAS Contracting Division 		Attn:  Connie Houpt, AMQ-210 		P. O. Box 25082 		Oklahoma City, OK  73125-4931 Responses may be faxed to the attention of Connie Houpt, Market Survey No. 06-61220 at (405) 954-9219 or e-mail at Connie.M.Houpt@faa.gov.

<DESC>Description
The United States Citizenship and Immigration Service's (USCIS) Integrated Document Production (IDP) Program Office, Washington, DC is seeking sources for a new identification card personalization (printings, encoding, etc.) system suite to produce Permanent Resident cards, Laser Visa/Border Crossing cards, and Employment Authorization Document cards, as well as cards driven by new initiatives.  This effort would include equipment, systems integration, related software and contractor logistics support over the life cycle of the system suite. 
The USCIS IDP Program Office is interested in a system suite that meets the following requirements:
1. Printing on polycarbonate ISO 7810 ID-1 (CR-80) and PVC ISO ID-1 (CR-80) and CR-100 size cards.  The systems should also be capable of applying holograms and plastic laminate patches.  The overall system should be capable of a volume of between 4 and 11 million polycarbonate cards per year, and 1.6 million PVC cards per year. 
2. Printing capability may initially be via dye sublimation, however, vendors sought should be capable of both laser etching and reverse transfer technologies.
3. Based on the requirements identified in Item #1, the system should be scalable to handle growing volume requirements and flexible in order to allow for the addition of new or different printing technologies as they are required or as they become available.  The overall system architecture should be capable of controlling different machines in the system suite.
4. The overall system architecture should be designed such that an individual card, with its own unique bard code serial number, can be read into the system, matched to a local networked data base record, and processed and tracked throughout the personalization process based on that serial number/database record matching.  The system should allow card orders to be processed, tracked and have quality assurance checks performed throughout the personalization process based on a match of the unique card 1-D barcode serial number against the matching database record.
5. The system suite should be able to encode cards that have either magnetic stripes, smart card chips (FIPS-201 compliant) or optical stripes (Drexler standard).
6. The system should include a function to automatically and autonomously check the processed card for correct biometric and biographic data, when compared to the original database record.
7. The system should include an automatic mailing function which would take finished cards, and insert them with an associated mailing insert into envelopes ready for mailing.
8. The system should be capable of being operated in a standard clean room environment.
Any available maintenance information should also be included.  Any data on mean time between failures and mean time to repair should be included if available.
9.  Interested Offerors should include price information for lease, purchase, or lease to purchase pricing.  Offerors should include systems integration costs including related software costs in addition to the cost of printing
Interested firms should include information concerning leasing or lease-to-buy arrangements if they are available.  Additionally information on contractor logistics support options should also be included.  
Interested firms shall respond with brief documentation showing the company’s ability to fulfill the requirements described above.  Responses to this announcement should include a technical description and detailed characteristics of the systems offered.  Responses should also address system safety, system operations under applicable safety and environmental standards, and any unique destruction considerations for all consumables used in the personalization process.  Information submitted shall be marked with restrictive legends as deemed appropriate by the potential Offeror.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  All information submitted in response to this announcement must arrive on or before the closing date.  
This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.

Therefore, the Defense Distribution Center is seeking sources to provide paper cushioning machine that uses recycled  paper multi-ply rolls and crinkles paper into a form that can be used for package cushioning, block and bracing, void fill and wrapping.

DDCT’s mission is located on Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NAS CC). Consumption rate is approximately 3 pallets per month. Paper cushioning is used on-demand during operating hours. The paper cushioning making machine requires prompt maintenance, of no more than two days response time. Procurement of recycled multi-ply paper will be filled monthly to ensure an acceptable on-hand quantity at all times.   A paper cushioning machine uses recycled paper, multi-ply rolls and crinkles paper into a form that can be used for package cushioning, block and bracing, void fill and wrapping.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Modular Electromechanical Batteries for Cost-Effective Bulk Storage of Electrical Energy
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Modular Electromechanical Batteries for Cost-Effective 
Bulk Storage of Electrical Energy 

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity for partnership and licensing of a new technology for the bulk-storage of electrical energy in modular “electromechanical batteries” (EMBs). The technology embodies several novel design concepts for storing electrical energy as rotational energy. The new designs specifically address the requirements of low capital cost, long service life with minimal maintenance, and low rate of self-discharge, features that are essential for satisfying a growing need for cost-effective bulk energy storage.  

Background:  The Laboratory has several decades of experience in the development of EMBs for specialized (high-power) applications where pulses of electrical power are required, such as are needed to “ride-through” short interruptions of electrical power from the net.  In the course of this development some critical technologies, such as low-cost “passive” magnetic bearings and special designs for the generator/motors and the fiber-composite rotors of the EMB were developed.  Some of these technologies, such as the passive magnetic bearings, the fiber-composite rotor designs, and the vacuum technology can be incorporated in EMBs for bulk storage.  However, the low capital cost, long service life with minimal maintenance, and low rate of self-discharge application carries with it new requirements that cannot be met in conventional ways.  It may be necessary to insert an interval of many hours, or even many days, between the time that the EMB is “charged” and when it is discharged into a load.  In addition, present electrochemical batteries, typically have turnaround efficiencies of order of 75 percent, so that 25 percent of the input energy is lost in every charge-discharge cycle. "Pumped-storage" systems of the type now in use by some electrical utilities have comparably low turnaround efficiencies, and the resulting losses are compounded by transmission-line losses, owing to the fact that pumped storage facilities are typically sited in mountainous areas, far from the urban areas where their stored energy is being used.

Description:	The new EMB designs are intended to answer to all of the new requirements for bulk energy storage systems, including very low parasitic losses and high turnaround efficiency. The new systems are designed for low capital and maintenance cost, and long (decades) service lifetime.  The size of the modules will be such as to make them useful in a wide variety of applications, all the way from single-use in residential settings, to use in “battery banks” at substations and/or alternate-energy generating plants.    

 
Advantages: 

Features and Benefits	
Decades-long service life with minimal maintenance.	
Lowered operating cost and greater reliability 
High turnaround efficiency	
Better ability to take advantage of peak/off-peak rate structures.
Modularity	
Better suited to mass-production; broadens fields of application

Potential Applications:  The new EMB technology has many potential commercial applications, both within and without the electrical utilities. In the utilities, the availability of cost-effective distributed storage with minimal maintenance and decades-long service life would fill a need for which there is presently no viable solution.  Another example is the telecommunications industry, where the electrochemical (lead-acid) back-up power system are notoriously poor in terms of high maintenance requirements and short service life in warm-climate situations.  Stand-alone solar and wind-power systems represent another example of an application where present systems are inadequate.  Office buildings could take advantage of the differences between peak and off-peak electrical rates by having energy storage systems in their basements.    

Development Status:  Preliminary designs have been made on the basis of which theory-based computer programs predicting the performance of the system have been made.  Experiments, including vacuum enclosure tests and relevant magnetic bearing tests, have been made.  Fiber-composite rotors have been fabricated, Preliminary production cost analyses have been made.  Patent protection is already in place or is being pursued for all aspects of the designs. 

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

This solicitation is issued as as a request for quotation (RFQ), number ESQ060022.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.  This solicitation is set set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business.  Should we not receive fair and reasonable quotes from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses, we will award to Small Business.  Therefore, we encourage all small business to submit a quote.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 561621.  The Small Business Annual Receipts for the firm and its affiliates, for the proceding three (3) fiscal years does not exceed $11.5 million. The primary purpose of this snyposis/ solicitation is to acquire a video surveillance system for the Fire and Aviation Management Fire Cache facilities located in Billings, Montana, at the Billings Airport Industrial Park, north of the Billings airport.  The system must be designed, installed and be maintainable using industry standard hardware, software and methodologies.  After successful installation, all operations will be tested and verified.  Training for system use and trouble-shooting will be provided to on-site BLM staff. Area 1.    The Billings Interagency Fire Cache, adjacent storage buildings and parking lots. The Fire cache areas consists of a large 2 story warehouse and office area, a parking lot, an adjacent storage building (the tool repair area), a fenced storage area and driving and parking areas between the buildings and storage areas. The areas to be covered by the system are: 1. The parking lot on the south side of the 2 story building; 2. Driveways between and adjacent to the buildings; 3. The doorways into the cache office on all sides on the 2 story building; 4. The garage doors leading into the warehouses; 5. The fenced storage area where the cache trailers are stored; 6. The doorways into the adjacent storage building; 7. The doorways and area around the tool repair area. Coverage areas should concentrate on doorways, garage doors and the driveway between the 2 story building and the tool repair area.  The BLM will conduct a pre-bid Site Inspection tour on June 12, 2006, at 10:00 AM, and will identify these areas for the prospective bidders. Interested parties are to meet in the Conference Room at the Billings Interagency Dispatch Center, 1299 Rimtop Drive, Billings, MT (North of the Billings Airport).  Questions regarding coverage areas shall be answered to the group of bidders and not to individuals. Maps of the project area will be available at the site tour.  It is highly recommended that all prospective bidders attend the site tour in order to obtain information regarding camera locations, etc.   Scope:  Provide video surveillance and monitoring of the buildings and parking lots that comprise the Billings Interagency Fire Cache.   Requirements:  Provide, install, configure all hardware and software and provide end-user training for all aspects of a video surveillance system to monitor the described areas.  Coverage will be 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  Images will be recorded in digital format and transferred to dvd format for long term storage.    Cameras will be fixed and will be located in all-weather housings.  All camera mountings will be capable of holding the camera motionless during high winds typical of the airport area.  Focal length and camera angle shall be set by the vendor in accordance with BLM definition of the coverage area as stated above.  The vendor is expected to determine the number of cameras required to fulfill the Scope of the project.  The control system will also be adjustable to account for "camera shake" so that recording does not occur if the camera does move during high winds.  Cameras will be color (preferable) or monochrome, high resolution with 0.04 lux sensitivity or better.   Cameras will be responsive in low light situations and will provide adequate imaging for personnel identification 24 hours per day (existing parking lot lighting may be factored in for camera specifications).  Cameras will have motion detectors and the system will only record after motion is detected by any or all cameras.  The motion detection time delay will be user adjustable; at installation the delay shall be set to 3 seconds.  Camera voltage requirements will be matched throughout the system. Vendor will be responsible for insuring proper electrical connections at all camera locations.  All electrical work must comply with all appropriate codes and regulations.   Vendor is responsible for coordinating any major electrical or structural work with Billings Logan Airport officials.  Cabling from cameras to recording devices will be adequate to prevent signal loss or degradation over the run of the cable.  Use of best available technology is expected.  Cabling may be standard coax, fiber optic or twisted pair at vendor's discretion.  All connectors and hardware needed to establish the cable runs from the camera to the recording device will be provided, installed and tested by the vendor.  All cabling and hardware will be inter-operable and will be tested prior to user training.  There may be some existing conduit, J-hooks, D-rings and other cable run facilities that may be used in some areas of the building.  The BLM may allow use of some existing conduit; however the vendor is responsible for all cable runs. Where cables enter buildings, proper entrance facilities will be used.  Cable runs will not conflict with or damage any existing cabling or electrical lines. Monitoring and recoding devices will be located and installed in the Fire cache building in a space designated by the BLM.  This space will be on the second floor in the designated Telecommunications Room.  The vendor shall supply and mount a shelf for the recording/control device to rest on and shall mount a 17 inch (minimum) flat panel computer monitor on the wall near the shelf.  The BLM shall designate the area the shelf and monitor must be mounted in.  All cables required for connecting the monitor to the recording device will be supplied by the vendor.  The monitor will display "live" images and will have a blank screen default screen saver.  The timeout for screen saver activation will be user configurable. The BLM will provide electrical connections for the monitoring and recording devices.  The vendor is required to furnish a battery powered uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for each monitoring /recording device. The primary purpose would be to provide a more stable power supply to the monitoring/recording devices.  If more than 1 camera is required (this is expected), the monitoring device will include a multiplexer to allow viewing of all cameras at once or choosing an individual camera for monitoring.  The monitoring device will allow an operator to review recorded images and the ability to "freeze-frame" on a selected image.  The vendor will install signs in the monitored area and on all buildings informing personnel that video surveillance is in use. Recording will be in digital format.  The recording device will have at least a 100 gigabyte hard drive for storing images.  The recording device will have a dvd burner attached.  Vendor will furnish a minimum of 10 dvd's per recorder and will provide instructions and training on transferring images from the recorder to a dvd.  All required hardware and software for transferring images to dvd will be installed and tested prior to system acceptance.  The recording device will also have at least 1 USB port, an Ethernet network interface card (user configurable) and all buttons or peripheral devices required for operations.  The recording device may be attached to the BLM network in the future. All hardware will have a minimum of a one year warranty on all parts and labor.  The installation will be warranted for 1 year for parts and labor at no further cost to the BLM, including after business hours service calls for hardware failure.  All software installation media will remain on site and become property of the BLM.  All installed hardware will become the property of the BLM.  Upon notification of a system failure, the vendor shall respond with a phone call to the BLM with in two ( 2)  hours and be prepared to be on site within four (4) hours.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>The following questions and answers were received: Q1.       The specifications indicate that the conveyor must have a power supply and be mobile.  Does this mean the conveyor has it's own power supply, or can it have a power cord? A1.       The conveyor must have a cord length of 20 feet according to the scope of work Kim gave me. So it needs to have a cord.  Q2.       We need to determine: 1)  the angle of ascent 2)  the overall length of the unit 3)  the power output requirements A2.        Length/angle of ascent of unit is dependent upon quoted infeed and discharge heights:  36" height infeed and 100" height discharge.  Footprint must allow unit to be turned into a 28" wide shelving aisle from a 10 foot wide main aisle.   Power requirements were 65 ft per min - 1/2" HP reversing center drive - 110V.

                                  STATEMENT OF WORK
UNDERGROUND FUEL PIPELINE UTILITIES INVESTIGATION
NAVAL AIR STATION NORTH ISLAND SAN DIEGO, CA

1.0	INTRODUCTION

1.1	LOCATION

	Work is to be performed at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego CA.  

1.2	DESCRIPTION

The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC), Energy and Utilities Department is requesting an underground fuel pipeline mapping of two, JP-5, 10-inch pipelines; each pipeline is approximately 3.5 miles in length. NFESC is requesting this mapping as a result of inconclusive hydrostatic pressure tests on September 15, 2005 and September 16, 2005 under contract N47408-04-D-8503.  The required hydrostatic pressure test was unsuccessful due to air trapped inside the pipelines.  Venting the trapped air in the pipelines was not possible, because there are valve pits that can’t be located, valve handles in pits that are inoperable, and valve pit pipe risers with valves removed and capped. This investigation will MAP location and depth of each pipeline, location of vents, low point drains, and valve pits. The outcome of this investigation will determine the number and locations of vents required to successfully perform a hydrostatic test on each pipeline.

2.0	SCOPE

2.1	GENERAL

The Contractor shall provide all necessary qualified personnel, equipment and materials to map the underground fuel pipelines and document findings.  

2.2	PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

Map the two 10-inch underground pipelines in AutoCAD, and provide labor to open valve pit covers and document findings. 

The AutoCAD drawings will be on CD and paper form.  The drawings will identify, but not limited to, the location, slope and depth of each pipeline, and the appurtenances (valve pits, valves, riser vents, and low point riser drains).   The current system has 15 manhole covers that are damaged or cannot be located. 

NFESC will be present to assess the internal piping and valves at those locations. 

3.0	GOVERNMENT FURNISHED INFORMATION (GFI)

The following information will be furnished to the Contractor with this Statement of Work.  All GFI shall be returned at the completion of the project.

<DESC>This amendment is in response to questions;

Question:

How do we incorporate the scrap steel surcharge into our bid?

Answer:

It is NIST’s opinion that this is a surcharge that the steel industry adds into their internal pricing for the disposal of the scrap that is left from manufacturing of the S780 Steel Shot. As this is the cost of doing business, this is a cost that should be included at the Contractor’s discretion.

Question:

In that the application is for the shot to act as a ballast to protect employees from absorption and radiation, is it possible to add Ferromanganese (75% Mn, 25% Fe) to the drum to bring the manganese content higher?

Answer:

Any use of Ferromanganese is unacceptable.

Question:

Can the limit on manganese be lowered somewhat?

Answer:

NIST requires the range of manganese to remain as stated in the solicitation.
