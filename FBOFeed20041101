Sole Source: DSPCon Inc, 380 Foothill Rd. Ste. 101, Bridgewater, NJ 08807.  Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the proposal.  However, all proposals received prior to the closing date on the solicitation will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  The Government does not own the data or the rights to the data needed to purchase this item from additional sources. Sole source: DSPCon Inc., 380 Foothill Rd. Ste 101, Bridgewater, NJ 08807. Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in- (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Anticipated award date: 21 JUL 2004. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selections.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation; which in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The RFP will be issued on or about 11/16/04.  Proposals shall be received in this office on 12/16/04.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make an award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in order of importance are: (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Technical Approach.  The Technical factor is more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration through the GPE on FedBizOps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.
Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.

<DESC>USAID/Washington (hereinafter to as USAID) intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) to provide recruitment, employment, and backstopping of Technical Advisors in AIDS, Child Survival, Infectious Diseases, Population and Basic Education (hereafter abbreviated TAACS) as authorized in the Foreign Assistance Appropriations Act FY 87 to assist USAID in the implementation of priority programs in the health, HIV/AIDS, nutrition, population and basic education sectors.  

The RFP will be issued/posted on USAID’s agency website: www.fedbizops.gov under the section on business and procurement on or about February 03, 2005.

Background information follows:

The TAACS Program is managed by the Bureau for Global Health (GH), and is currently providing 69 TAACS to the Agency, approximately half of whom are serving with overseas Missions.  Because the TAACS mechanism is a major Agency resource, providing staff with direct-hire authorities to carry out the Agency’s key programs, a TAACS contract that provides strong recruitment and backstopping support is essential to the Agency’s effectiveness, particularly to Basic Education and the Expanded Response in HIV-AIDS and Infectious Diseases.  

The Contractor shall reliably and efficiently complete tasks for recruitment, hiring and placement, training, backstopping, supervising, and evaluating TAACS, who will provide long term technical and managerial assistance to USAID overseas and to various technical offices in USAID/Washington. They will work in the design, management, implementation and evaluation of child survival, HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases, population and basic education activities. Upon selection, the Contractor will employ them as employees of the Contractor’s organization while the TAACS provide technical advice and management capabilities to the USAID Offices and Missions.

The USAID TAACS Program Coordinator, Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) and the Contract Director shall undertake appropriate coordination with other USAID offices, bureaus, and Missions with respect to the Agency guidance on Technical Advisors in AIDS and Child Survival, as contained in USAID Automated Directives System (ADS) Series 200, References.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the purchase of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accepted Software Package specifically designed for Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) activities.	 MSFC is responsible for determining characterization of both organic (volatiles) and inorganic (metals and general chemistry) chemicals from potentially hazardous site samples in compliance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).  MSFC’s Environmental Laboratory is currently pursuing recognition by the EPA by obtaining a National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Certification (NELAC).	In order to accomplish this task, MSFC must utilize EPA recognized Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) software package specifically designed and scalable for EPA CERCLA reporting and characterization of both organics (volatiles) and inorganics (metals and general chemistry).  In addition, this software package must be designed and scalable for a relatively small laboratory (5 persons), and independent of procuring a complex and non-essential Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), but including the capability for rapid electronic data review/validation coupled and integrated into the electronic data deliverable system. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Environmental Information Systems, Corporation (EISC) located in Las Vegas, NV.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.   EISC offers an EPA-accepted scalable contract laboratory program software package which allows MSFC to acquire only the Volatiles (organics), Metals and General Chemistry (inorganic) Analytical Review software modules from a larger total package.  This is the only known source that provides the necessary flexibility for MSFC to obtain only the required modules which are currently necessary for reporting to EPA.  Since MSFC currently does not have a requirement to test other samples such as pesticides or semi-volatiles, acquisition from another source would mean MSFC would be required to purchase two additional unnecessary software systems/modules.  Also, EISC is the only known vendor that provides a CLP software package to a laboratory without the purchase of a LIMS.  Therefore, the EISC software would not require the purchase of extra non-essential equipment. EISC is the only known vendor who can satisfy MSFC’s technical requirements as follows:  (1) Capable of	producing a quick data validation in 90 seconds and  complete report generation in 20 minutes;  (2) Provides a scalable software package; (3) Works with a laboratory of only five employees, (4) Provides both organic and inorganic chemical analysis and validation electronic software, and (5) Does not require an unnecessary and complex upfront network system tying all of the laboratory equipment together. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 4, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, has a requirement for Demolition and Deconstruction Services at various Army Installations.  The Armys Installation Management Agency (IMA) is responsible for providing equitable, effective a nd efficient management of Army installations worldwide.  IMA is divided into seven geographic regions encompassing the continental United States as well as the Pacific, Europe and Korea.  Services are being sought primarily for IMAs Northeast Region (ME,  NH, VT, MA, CT, RI, NY, NJ, DE, PA, MD, WV, and VA).  On occasion, services may be requested for government facilities within the other continental US regions.  Among the many Army-wide programs assigned to IMA, the Facility Reduction Program (FRP) elimin ates excess facilities and infrastructure that reduces fixed installation costs.  The goal of the FRP is to reduce the maximum amount of excess facility areas at Army installations through demolition and deconstruction of buildings and structures, for the best value in a reasonable amount of time to produce clean sites consistent with environmental and safety requirements and objectives.   This acquisition addresses the Northeast Regional Office (NERO) of the Installation Management Agency (IMA).  NERO supp orts the soldiers, civilians, and family members of 28 installations in the northeast that spans five major commands.  Tasks to be performed using this contract include:  facilities reduction, demolition and/or deconstruction; site assessments; environment al assessments; remediation of facilities contaminants (i.e., lead, asbestos, PCBs, petroleum byproducts); recycling of building materials; redirection of waste streams; value engineering; data collection, analysis and reporting; transfer of lessons learne d.  Requirements will include:  planning for and carrying out demolition (or deconstruction) of an undetermined amount of various government buildings, structures and facilities, and removal and transport of construction debris, asbestos and/or lead based paint.  Debris reduction through recycling, debris processing, etc., will be a major consideration.  Demolition of buildings and structures inherently effects the local environment.  Local regulations will be identified.  The Government shall provide infor mation that relates to hazardous material and environmental protection regulations at each base.  A single solicitation with multiple awards is proposed for this contract.  It will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with one bas e year and four one-year options.  The contract will be a services contract (with incidental A-E services).  Approximately 85% of the task order effort will be firm fixed-price (FFP) with the capability to issue time and materials (T&M) task orders.   The total usage of all the contracts is $2,950,000 for the base year, and $2,950,000 for the each of the four option years.  The estimated total program ceiling is $14,750,000.  The contract is subject to the minimum ordering requirements.  This contract will be used to execute the Facilities Reduction Program lessons learned.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The North American Industry Classification System Codes for this acquisition is 562910 Environmental Remediation.  Source Selection Procedures  will be in accordance with all currently applicable FAR, DFARS, AFARS, and EFARS provisions. The procurement strategy will be a competitive negotiation using the source selection trade-off process in order to obtain services that offer the best value to t he government.  Source selection will include a page-limited written proposal and/or oral discussions upon which the final selections will be made.  The Contractor will be selected on a competitive basis by applying meaningful and objectively rated evaluat ion factors stated clearly in the Source Selection Plan and the solicitation.  Those factors will include past performance, technical and management capability,  and price.  The Government will also consider past performance information from all relevant sources, in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(ii).  The contract will be awarded to the offerors who are determined to provide the best value based upon evaluation  of all factors.  The contract will require the contractor to continually assess and upgrade his technologies and technical knowledge bases throughout the life of the contract.  The contractor will be responsible for preparing environmental documentation, permit applications, and developing an environmental plan where applicable.  The intent is to issue a Request For Proposals (RFP) within this calendar year for Businesses that have the ability to meet these specific requirements. A Preproposal Conference i s planned (date TBD) to help answer any questions Businesses may have on the RFP. Questions are to be sent by email to: Kathy.R.Wallace@hnd01.usace.army.mil

<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Officer Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) Project Officer, General Fund Enterprise Business System (PO, GFEBS) in concert with the Army Contracting Agency (ACA), Information Technology, E-Commerce and Commercial  Contracting Center (ITEC4), intends to release a Draft Request For Proposal (DRFP) and subsequently a solicitation for an integrated financial management system solution to include Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) softwar e, Systems Integration (SI) services support, and Application Service Provider (ASP) services support.  Collectively, this new system will be known as General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS).  The Department of the Army needs to replace the dated b atch-oriented mainframe-based systems that currently support its General Fund accounting and financial management requirements. The Army needs a new financial management system to improve performance, standardize processes, and ensure that it can meet futu re needs. The ERP product shall be 2003 certified by the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP).  The GFEBS application shall fulfill the requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) (as recorded and amplified in  the Blue Book). This new system shall be capable of supporting DoD with accurate, reliable, and timely financial information, in peacetime and in war. The resulting system shall provide web-based, online, real-time transaction and information capability a nd be accessible to the active Army, Army National Guard (ARNG), United States Army Reserve (USAR), and various DoD Components, CONUS and OCONUS.  The primary purpose of GFEBS is to support the transformation of the Army's budget and finance processes.  Th e potential also exists for the use of this contract by other DoD Components (in accordance with Management Initiative Decision (MID) 920).  The primary capability required is to maximize the Army's ability to reduce legacy stove-piped systems and data, an d to allow an environment that provides all levels of leadership with reliable, relevant, and timely data on an enterprise-wide basis.  The initial area of functionality that the contractor will be required to address is Real Property Inventory/Management at one Installation Management Agency site (Fort Jackson, SC).  For this program, real property is defined as real estate. The Army intends to select a System Integrator (SI) for this effort.  The contractor will be required to propose their recommended COTS ERP solution and to provide program management, methodology, and necessary implementation services for the program objec tives.   The contractor shall also be required to provide a process to enable Change Management and Business Process Reengineering (BPR).  The Army desires a GFEBS that employs best business practices of the COTS ERP software.  An evolutionary approach described as  Increments one and two is contemplated to ensure a demonstrated success early in the project, to demonstrate aggressive but achievable milestones, to ensure Army-wide scalability, and to demonstrate system usability and compatibility with the Navy and Air  Force.  The Government desires to field Release 1.1 within nine (9) months of contract award.  The Army is seeking a sound strategy based on a Government provided high-level functional architecture, which will frame the functional scope and establish a ba seline for follow-on enterprise activities.  The Army will manage the GFEBS project using critical components of earned-value management (EVM) for program planning, reporting, and management.  The Army intends to award a single, performance-based, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity hybrid contract type with financial incentives.  The contract will have a ten-year period of performance.  The Government's intention is to conduct the acquisiti on under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.

<DESC>UPDATE (11-01-04) SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (SRD) AND CONTRACT DATA REQUIREMENTS LIST (CDRL)  POSTED All interested parties are asked to review the SRD and the CDRL DD Form 1423s  and provide questions and comments to the contractual POC listed below at your  earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm EST on 05 Nov 2004.  If you have any  additional questions regarding the upcoming RFP release, please direct them to  the contractual POC listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (10-20-04) Change in Pricing Strategy The first draft Request for Proposal (RFP) stated that the pricing structure  for the contract will be 5 years firm-fixed-price (FFP), 3 years fixed price  with economic price adjustment (FP/EPA), and 2 years Not to Exceed (NTE).  As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (10-05-04) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION REGARDING PRODUCTION/DELIVERY All offerors planning to respond to the upcoming T-38C ESUP RFP are asked to  reply to the following questions: 1) Assuming the Government exercises a production option concurrent with  contract award, how long will it take before production will begin, regardless  of testing?  2) Given the same assumption, when will your company be able to begin  delivering production seats/shipsets for installation and what will be the  initial delivery rate, i.e., shipsets per month or seats per month?   3) In addition and given the same assumption as above, how long will it take  before your company can deliver seats at a rate of five (5) shipsets or ten  (10) seats per month?  Please respond to these questions at your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm  EST on 8 Oct 2004.  If you have any questions or concerns please contact the  contractual POC listed below.

The above items can be made available upon written request and demonstrated  interest in this program.  However, these items are available on a non- interference basis and access is by appointment only.  Please note that a visit  to Randolph AFB and Moody AFB will be required.     If your company is interested in arranging a time to visit these items and you  plan to respond to the T-38C ESUP RFP, please contact the contractual POC  listed below at your earliest convenience but no later than 12:00 pm EST on 4  Oct 2004.  Further instructions will be provided upon receipt of your request. RFP SCHEDULE UPDATE The second draft RFP will be released in sections between now and 22 Oct 2004.   As these sections are released, please review and provide comments within 3  business days.  The Final RFP is currently planned to be released on 10  November 2004.  Offeror responses to the Past Performance section will be  required approximately one month after RFP release.  Written proposals,  representative seat and associated hardware for installation and measurement in  the T-38C forebody will be required approximately two months after RFP release.

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Technology Service, Rocky Mountain Region, Denver, CO, intends to acquire work-life and employee assistance program services on behalf of the Department of Defense, Under Secretary of Defense (ODUSD), Military Community and Family Policy.   This Request for Information seeks the opinions and suggestions of both large and small businesses on the most efficient and effective methodology to acquire and deliver these services while optimizing small business participation.   The services support the Military OneSource program which provides 3 million members of the Armed Forces and their families, at locations worldwide, with access to a broad array of information and counseling services through the internet, telephone, and e-mail.   This program must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   The contractor will interact with the client community, furnishing referrals to information and services through a call center or on-line service.   The contractor is required to maintain a database of employee assistance providers which will then be utilized to refer military clients to the appropriate service provider through internet based tools or through master consultants staffing the call center.   The contractor is required to field calls for assistance with issues such as substance abuse, emotional well being including suicide, health and wellness, disability, legal, financial, elder care, parenting and child care, education services, relocation, Tri-care, and general every day issues.   The contractor must also provide a Nurse Line.    Service providers must be able to refer clients to military provided services and resources.   In addition, be able to inform military authorities of a crisis situation.   The military population must have one number/address to use to reach the service providers no matter where they or their family members are located.   Face-to-face counseling services will be limited to 6 per issue, and when these services are required in overseas locations, they will be provided by US citizens.   Travel from the US to overseas locations will be reimbursed in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulations.

The services are currently provided under a teaming arrangement between two large businesses under a task order against two Federal Supply Schedules, Human Resource Management and Management, Organization, and Business Improvement Services.   A new contract must replace this order by February 2005.   It is anticipated that a draft solicitation will be issued in November 2004.   

Please respond with a brief, informal paper addressing some or all of the following questions:  Is it feasible to set-aside all or a portion of these services for small business?   Does a small business have the resources and capacity to manage a program of this magnitude (please expand on this topic)?   If a small business set-aside is pursued, would the small business be able to provide a network of providers worldwide and still adhere to the limitation on subcontracting of 50% (50% of the work must be performed by the contractor’s own employees)?   If a recommendation is to divide the employee population into smaller contract portions, perhaps geographically, how would separate contractors interact with each other to provide the military population with uninterrupted, quality service?    If there are multiple contractors, how would a family that is separated by distance or is disbursed temporarily over several locations easily access services, and how would data on their cases be maintained or shared?   What type of quality oversight is the industry practice?    How would that oversight be accomplished with multiple small business contract holders?   If your recommendation is that the procurement not be set-aside for small business, how do you envision a program of this size being managed while achieving the greatest utilization of small businesses?   Small businesses are invited to also provide a description of their firm’s capabilities.

Responses can be sent in writing before November 5 by e-mail to FTS R10 Acquisition@gsa.gov.    Response sent via US Postal Service can be address to Ms. Jeny Pomber 10TQ, GSA FTS, 400 15th Street SW, Auburn, WA 98001.   Questions or concerns may also be sent in writing to Jeny.Pomber@gsa.gov.

PART ONE (1):  Original Pre-Solicitation Notice -- HSTS04-05-R-DEP979


1. The TSA's Security Technology Deployment Office (STDO) is responsible for procuring and deploying technology to support the safety and security of the movement of people and baggage throughout the nation’s airports.

5)  What is the estimated value of the contract to be awarded?
     Who is the incumbent contractor?  What is the Contract Number?      
     What is the estimated value of the incumbent contract?  What is the 
     Incumbent’s period of performance? 
a)  The estimated value of the contract to be awarded will be not released. 
b)  Boeing Services Company
c)  DTSA20-02-C00002
*d)  $495.5 million USD
e)  06/2002 through 12/2004

* The estimated value of the incumbent contract was derived from historical data.  This figure is not to interpreted as the approximate award for the new contract(s).  It is posted for the interested party(s) reference only.

6)  Is this procurement a re-compete of a previous contract?




This re-compete acquisition process addresses the installation/integration portion of contract #
7)  What type of contract will be awarded?
It is the intent of the TSA to award an IDIQ contract.
8)  What is the estimated procurement schedule?





This question has already been addressed.  Refer to FAQ# 1-3.


9)  If we are a subcontractor to a firm or firms selected for Deployment services, would it conflict us out of the work we're currently doing or work of a similar nature in the future?
 

The Government is not familiar with all of the offerors’ existing businesses.  Offerors’ will be responsible for identifying potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest, and addressing OCI mitigation plans.
10)  In reference to the 'STDO TSA Deployment Integration Re-Compete Opportunity, is there an incumbent for this possible requirement?  If so, could you please provide the incumbent name, contract #, and contract duration and value?  I sincerely appreciate your assistance and response regarding this inquiry.


 

Note, this question was addressed previously, no need to repeat it.
11)  How are responses to be submitted?    






Responses from Interested Party(s) shall be submitted and received at the appropriate TSA HQ address No Later Than 1500 hrs. EST, Wednesday, 03 November 2004. Refer to Synopsis, Description Section Paragraph # 10 for applicable address.
12)	How many copies are to be submitted?
 
The synopsis addresses this question.  Under the Description Section of the synopsis, Paragraph # 4 states that 5 copies are required.
13)  Will small companies with large companies as subcontractors be allowed to compete?
Qualified small businesses are encouraged to compete for these requirements. This competition is wide open. 






14)  What is the actual due date for the Qualifying Statements?
This question has been addressed previously.  No need to address this question again.
!5) The current program for this work being performed by Boeing is afforded protection under Public Law 85-804.  Given that the work is similar and the risks are almost identical, will the same protection be afforded the successful Offeror(s) for this re-compete?
NO.
16)  The Presolicitation Notice states that the government will provide Site Survey & Site Assessment information that will determine the “Unique geographic location” for the GFSE.    In the current program, the Site Assessment is prepared with modeling data that confirms the number and types of screening equipment required to meet passenger and /or baggage flows.  The Presolicitation Notice also states that “Contractor DESIGNS shall include the proper quantity and technology mix…….”  Does this mean that the Site Assessment report will not identify the quantity and types of equipment required?  That the Contractor must make these assessments based on passenger and/or baggage flow data including the modeling to confirm decisions?  This may be important in determining the depth of the TEAM that is required to provide the services requested. 
The Presolicitation Notice refers to “testing” of the GFSE.  It is our understanding that currently the TSA is moving towards either the OEM providing their own equipment installation and SAT testing (i.e., L-3) or having an independent firm such as Batelle perform these tests as witnessed by the TSA.  Is it the intent of the RFP to have Awarded Contactor perform the SAT, or to ensure that the site is fully prepared for GFSE installation and SAT?

                                                                                                                                                       
Answer to this question is pending.  TSA will respond.






17)  What is the reason that this contract is being re-competed?
This requirement is being re-competed to address the needs of the TSA.




 18)  I am writing to you today to inquire about Pre-Solicitation, HSTS04-05-R-DEP979.  Is this a new requirement?  If not, who is the current Incumbent?  What is the award number and value?  When was the contract awarded and when is it expected to end?
 


Question already addressed – no need to address again.
19)  Is the correct Qualifying Statement Form that is to be used is GSA Form 527?
No, Please refer to Synopsis Section Description, Paragraph 4; sub paragraph 4a., & 4b. 
20)    When is the final cut-off day for questions related to the FEDBIZOPs Announcement?

Posting?
No, there was no pre-conference.

No, there will not be any small business set aside on this project.

The current incumbent is Boeing Services Company.


24)  Where can we find information on HSTS04-05-R-DEP979?
All information that is currently available for this project is found in the Synopsis Posting dated 19 October; and the FAQ.


25)  Can the Qualifying Statement Deadline be extended one fortnight?
The Synopsis Posting dated 19 October 2004 states that the deadline is 3:00 pm EST, 03 November 2004. The needs of the government preclude any extension to the deadline.


26)	My company manufactures intrusion detection equipment for large airport perimeters.  I have several questions.

a.	Is there a list of GSFE available?  
b.	How may I contact the TSA/STDO?
c.	Is perimeter intrusion detection part of this project?





(GSFE =  Government Security Furnished Equipment)

A)	No
B)	Please review the TSA web site for entry points of contact.
C)	No


27)   Is maintenance of the ASE part of this contract award?

31)  IS the TSA looking for a General Contractor vs. Small Business Contractors?
Contracting Officer will address this question.
32)  What type of contract is to be awarded?  Time and Material vs. Fixed Price.
The resulting contract award(s) will be an IDIQ that may utilize both T&M and Fixed Price orders to fulfill TSA requirements.
33)  Who is to provide the site surveys?  If it is other than the Contractor who is awarded the contract, then the risk factor will  significantly increase.
The Government intends to provide site surveys.


34)  In Paragraph 6 of the Description Section of the posted Synopsis, It states that changes in teaming arrangements after this initial announcement shall invalidate the Offeror’s eligibility for consideration unless prior approval from the Contacting Officer is granted.  At this stage of the Offeror’s proposal, the teaming situation is very fluid.  What is meant by the above statement?
The Government will not allow Offerors’ to “bait and switch” team members throughout the acquisition process for this project.  Offerors’ should be able to form a team that will not change through this project’s acquisition cycle.  Any inconsistency of a team’s approach to fulfill government requirements may be viewed as a performance risk in their evaluation.  One plausible rationale for substitution of a team member may be OCI issues.


36)  What is the actual due date for the Qualifying Statements?
Question has been previously addressed.  No need to answer again.


37)  The Synopsis states that 5 copies of the Qualifying Statements are required.  The synopsis also states that the copies can be submitted by e-mail or fax.  Won’t one copy suffice and that TSA make the required amount of copies?
The Synopsis clearly states that five (5) copies of the Qualifying Statements shall be submitted to TSA
38)  When will the FAQ be published?
TSA will post the FAQ As Soon As Possible.


39)  What is the actual due date?
This question has been previously answered.  No need to answer it again.

This question has been answered previously; It is a full and open competition.

<DESC>Correction to discription of work posted in original posting: PROJECT TITLE:  American River Watershed Project, Folsom Dam Upper Tier Outlet Works Modifications, Folsom Dam and Lake, California JOB DESCRIPTION:  The project includes enlargement of 4 existing river outlet works and construction of 2 new river outlet works in the interior of Folsom Dam, California, without interfering in the normal operation and maintenance of the dam and multi-pur pose reservoir. Folsom Dam is a concrete gravity dam, up to 350 feet in height. As part of the enlargement of the existing 5 foot x 9 foot river outlets, the contractor will remove the 4 pairs of existing upper tier outlet gates, and fabricate, shop test, install, align and test new 9 foot 4 inch by 14 foot slide gates. The contractor will also excavate 2 new upper tier conduits in the dam and install new 9 foot 4 inch x 14-foot slide gates. The excavation for the intake for each of the conduits will be per formed underwater at depths of up to about 220 feet. A precast concrete panel, for each conduit, cast on site, will be installed, aligned, sealed and grouted in the excavated recess using underwater construction techniques. A new 5 foot 6 inch diameter ver tical air shaft will be bored in the dam for each of the 6 outlets and the 4 existing 2 foot 6 inch diameter air shafts will be filled with concrete. The existing horizontal air manifold tunnel will be enlarged. Two new construction adits will be excavated  and one of the existing inspection galleries will be enlarged, as will a new mechanical alcove. All 6 conduits will be lined with steel-reinforced concrete and grouted; and drains and water stops will be installed. Steel bulkheads will be fabricated and i nstalled to allow the work to proceed without impacting reservoir operations. New mechanical hydraulic power units and electrical controls will be installed, along with a communication system. The existing gantry crane and spillway bridge girders will be m odified to permit replacement of the 25 ton capacity auxiliary hoist and trolley assembly with a 55 ton capacity hoist and trolley assembly. The stilling basin will be dewatered and the sediment removed and disposed of. Rock anchors will be drilled and gro uted in the stilling basin slab and walls. The work shall include all preventative environmental control systems such as dust barriers, ventilation, drainage, utilities and noise abatement. Care and diversion of water will be required.

<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS), a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, intends to competitively make an award to a small business to study the Geologic Resource Assessment Program (GRASP II) model's current methodology, and to recommend solutions to issues raised by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists' review of the computer model GRASP.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541710-Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, with a size standard of 500 employees.  Brief Background:  The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), by virtue of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, the Submerged Lands Act, and pursuant to delegation of authority by the Secretary of the Interior, has jurisdiction over leasing and development of OCS submerged lands for mineral development.  In conjunction with this jurisdiction, the MMS is required to follow the overall minerals management goals as stated in the OCS Lands Act Amendments of 1978.  Related to MMS's responsibilities under the OCS Lands Act is the analysis of environmental and resource information prior to conducting an OCS oil and gas lease sale.  The MMS performs periodic estimates of the undiscovered oil and gas resource potential to support the decision process and policy issues in the preparation of lease sale documents.  The Government anticipates this effort will be performed in two phases over a period of three to six months.  Estimated cost of Phase I is between $10,000 and $15,000.  The total estimated amount for the project, both Phase I and Phase II, is between $60,000 and $99,999.  Phase II (option) is dependent upon the outcome of Phase I and, dependent on the outcome, may or may not be exercised.   HOW TO RESPOND:  If you or your organization is interested in receiving a copy of the Request for Quote for this effort, please send your name, organization's name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address, by Close of Business November 19, 2004, to the attention of Debra Bridge, Minerals Management Service, Fax Number 703-787-1041, or e-mail to debra.bridge@mms.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  The US Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP), provides federal leadership in developing the nation's capacity to prevent and control crime, improve the criminal and juvenile justice systems, increase knowledge about crime and related issues, and assist victims of crime.  Through the programs developed and funded by its bureaus and offices, OJP works to form partnerships among federal, state, and local government officials to control drug abuse and trafficking; reduce and prevent crime; rehabilitate neighborhoods; improve the administration of justice in America; meet the needs of victims of crime; and address problems such as gang violence, prison crowding, juvenile crime, and white-collar crime.  Among other programs, OJP sponsors information sharing initiatives to improve the effectiveness and fairness of the justice system through better information sharing among all its components, including juvenile justice, law enforcement, prosecution, defense, adult courts, corrections, probation and parole.  Justice leaders place top priority on integrating information systems in order to: improve the operational efficiency of the justice process among stakeholders & across jurisdictions; provide all justice personnel critical information needed for their safety and to enhance service in a cost-effective manner; and to allow decision-makers to uphold the fundamental ideals of the justice system.  One of the programs supported by OJP to meet its mission is the Global Justice Information Sharing Initiative (Global).  Global is a “group of groups”, representing more than thirty independent organizations spanning the spectrum of law enforcement, judicial, correctional and related bodies representing Federal, state, local and tribal agencies.  The Global Advisory Council (GAC) operates under the auspices of the OJP and advises the Federal government, specifically, through the Assistant Attorney General, OJP and the US Attorney General.  The focus of Global is to promote more efficient sharing of data among justice entities by facilitating standards-based electronic information exchange throughout the justice and public safety communities.  The broad scope of the effort is fundamental and crucial to its success.  The Global Executive Steering Committee (GESC) provides leadership for the GAC.  Global aids its member organizations and the people they serve through a series of initiatives, including facilitating Global working groups, developing technology standards such as the Global Justice XML Data Model (GJXDM), creating white papers on data sharing issues such as the National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan, and disseminating information via Global-related Web sites.  The work of Global and the GAC is primarily carried out in Working Groups.  There are currently four Working Groups, which may at times be supported by subcommittees.  Work products of these groups are submitted for consideration and approval by the GAC in its advisory role.  The Criminal Intelligence Coordinating Council (CICC) was established in support of the National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan.  The CICC will initially act as another subcommittee or Working Group under the auspices of the GAC.  Additional information about Global may be found on the Web at:  http://it.ojp.gov.  OJP requests information from potential offerors as to their capabilities of providing management support to Global and the Designated Federal Official (DFO) including, but not limited to (1) Logistical support:  coordinate site and facility selection, schedule, and announce meetings; provide on-site meeting management; facilitate coordination of public relations needs; provide post-meeting support, including coordinating reimbursement of travel expenses for attendees; assist in coordinating conference calls and other meeting support; ensure notices of GAC meetings, in coordination with DFO, are published in the Federal Register.  (2) Meeting support:  assist in identifying, readying and distributing preparatory documents, meeting materials and presentations as directed by OJP or Global leaders; provide policy research and support to facilitate group discussions as directed by OJP; attend meetings related to GAC, GESC, working groups, subcommittees, and special projects/events; attend annual meetings, coordinated and facilitated as previously stated, as a minimum, two meetings of the GAC and five meetings of the GESC; attend Global Working Group and subcommittee meetings as required by the DFO and GAC Chair, with planning to arrange and provide reimbursements for at least 35 meetings per year with an average attendance of 25 people; coordinate attendance of Global members and/or support staff to at least six conferences and meetings that promote justice information sharing via Global; attend at least six justice integration meetings and conferences to conduct outreach and promote the work of Global in coordination with OJP.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notification is a clarification of the previous notification number RAFSMOD64 posted in the FEDBIZOPS on 10 August 2004.  Interested parties who have previously submitted their Statements Of Capabilities (SOC) need not resubmit statements in response to this Sources Sought Notification. The Global Positioning System Joint Program Office (GPS JPO) intends to have a contractor redesign the IIF space-qualified Rubidium Atomic Frequency Standard (RAFS) for use on the GPS IIF and GPS III satellite constellations, as the existing RAFS has parts obsolescence problems that will prevent deliveries after FY2008. 
 Accordingly, the Government intends to award a contract to PerkinElmer Optoelectionics, 35 Congress Street, Salem, MA 01970, as the only responsible source that can provide the supplies described in this synopsis, without the Government incurring substantial duplication of cost that are not expected to be recovered through competition and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements. (10 U.S.C. § 2304(c)(1))  PerkinElmer is the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the RAFS for the Block IIF Space Vehicles (SV).  The Production Drawing Package for the existing Block IIF RAFS is proprietary to PerkinElmer and is not available to the public.  SYSTEM OVERVIEW: The RAFS provides a precise and stable sinusoidal frequency at 10.229, 999, 995, 43 MHz (in a vacuum) for the GPS SV. CONTRACT OBJECTIVES:  The contemplated contract will require delivery of the following supplies:  (a)  A complete RAFS parts obsolescence study.  Upon completion of the study, as an option, the Government will require the development and delivery of up to three production-representative RAFS in accordance with the performance and design/program specifications (i.e., Boeing specification document MC409-0262 "GPS IIF Rubidium Frequency Standard" (including the nuclear and space radiation environment as specified in Appendix I) and its companion specification documents MC409-0285 "GPS IIF Common Requirements").  Completion and delivery shall be within 42 months after receipt of order for two verified Flight Demonstration Units to be used for life testing and one tested Qualification unit (with a qualification test report); all three units are to be built with qualified flight components. The anticipated period of performance is October 2004–April 2007.
(b)  The RAFS's delivered will be completely form, fit and function compatible with the Block IIF RAFS as defined in the referenced specifications. (c)  The generation or update of RAFS and related documents as directed. (d) Strong, near real-time dialog and feedback structure with the GPS JPO to provide government insight, achieve quick issue resolution, and respond to Government direction. The scope of this acquisition does not include acquisition of RAFS clocks for production purposes for the GPS IIF/III satellite constellations and will not directly result in the procurement of RAFS's by the Government.  The sole purpose of this acquisition is to develop a qualified replacement product that suitable for procurement by existing and future follow-on Blocks IIF/III SV production prime contractor(s). Prospective contractors should submit SOCs in writing to the Government that include the following information:  1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact and telephone numbers, 2) Business size classification, Large, Small, or Other, 3) Experience in space AFS technologies (including prior successes in achieving development and production of space qualified AFS's; the response must emphasize the proven ability to meet the above scope and schedule), and 4) The facilities to work at the appropriate security level.  Responses should also indicate the source's intent to be either a prime contractor, subcontractor, or interest in obtaining a license to become a developer and supplier.  As regards licensing, respondents to this announcement are encouraged to provide, in addition to their SOC, information regarding their assessment of the value of technical data rights and/or licensing agreements and any other suggestions to assist the government in achieving its objective of developing a replacement for the Block IIF/III RAFS.  All responses shall be unclassified and should not exceed five (5) one-sided pages.  See Note 22. Oral communications are not acceptable.  Responses must be submitted by email in electronic form in MS Word 98 or higher format or PDF format. All responses must conform to 8.5 x 11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  If respondents wish to include proprietary or competition sensitive data, they must request additional directions from the primary POC, Lt Jason Bolger. This synopsis is for planning purposes only; any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. Additional questions to the Government may be included under separate cover; the Government reserves the right to not respond to all questions but will make an effort to respond to questions.  All questions will be considered in future program-planning efforts. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought request. In addition, the Government is interested in receiving industry views regarding the ongoing Government acquisition planning efforts.  The Government intends to post draft and planning documents in the GPS Bidders Library as they become available to allow industry to view and make comments.  Parties need to register with the GPS Bidder's Library, to obtain access.  Please submit a request to obtain access listing all of the individuals requiring access, and justification for access, and all contact information inclusive of email address to: Lt Jason Bolger Program Manager, GPS Space Atomic Frequency Standard, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467, El Segundo, CA, 90245, Phone: 310-363-2937, Fax: 310-363-6487, Email:

1.  	BACKGROUND

The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) is supporting the U.S. Government’s Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) by providing technical assistance to a group of Middle East countries in order to improve their legislative and regulatory frameworks, and ultimately, to facilitate the region’s preparedness for the Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA).

As trade and commerce increases in the Middle East and the countries in this region expand their presence in the global market, it is important that their business and legal professionals have knowledge and understanding of commercial law.

10. 	SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

The Government will award one (1) Purchase Order resulting for this solicitation to the responsible/responsive offeror(s), whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, results in the best value to the Government.  Evaluation factors are listed below in descending order of importance.  Technical factors are more important than price.  Offerors must provide a technical proposal with evidence and/or documentation that address all technical factors in order to be considered for evaluation.  A technical proposal that addresses only part of the technical requirements in Factor A and B below may not be considered fully responsive to the Government’s needs and may not be accepted.  The technical evaluation criteria will be conducted in accordance with weighted technical evaluations. 

 
Factor A – Technical 

Offeror shall provide a technical proposal that describes their technical approach to the tasks described in this SOW. The technical proposal shall also relate the Contractor’s previous experience related to the following areas to his/her ability to perform the tasks describe in this Statement of Work:

a.	Experience in developing commercial law curriculum (e.g., trade, business transactions, disputes).
b.	Experience working on and/or teaching international trade issues. 

The technical proposal is not to exceed 5 pages.

Factor B – Price

The price evaluation will determine whether the proposed prices are realistic, complete, and reasonable in relation to the requirement in the SOW.  The offeror shall provide a firm fixed price quote that includes all direct and indirect costs associated with the work requested in this SOW.  

11. 	PRICE/TECHNICAL PROPOSAL TRADE-OFF

The Government will perform the price/technical tradeoff of each proposal to determine which proposal represent the “best value” to the Government, price/cost and other factors considered.  “Best value” is defined as the offer that results in the most advantageous acquisition decision for the Government.  Technical quality in proposals is more important than price/cost.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest evaluated price/cost.  The analysis of all proposals will be performed through an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis between technical and price/cost factors.  Where proposals are essentially equal technically, price/cost becomes much more important.

The Government may enter into discussions if it deems discussions to be necessary; however, the Offeror shall assume that the Government will not enter discussions before awarding the contract.

10. 	SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

The Government will award one (1) Purchase Order resulting for this solicitation to the responsible/responsive offeror(s), whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, results in the best value to the Government.  Evaluation factors are listed below in descending order of importance.  Technical factors are more important than price.  Offerors must provide a technical proposal with evidence and/or documentation that address all technical factors in order to be considered for evaluation.  A technical proposal that addresses only part of the technical requirements in Factor A and B below may not be considered fully responsive to the Government’s needs and may not be accepted.  The technical evaluation criteria will be conducted in accordance with weighted technical evaluations. 

Factor A – Technical 

Offeror shall provide a technical proposal that describes their technical approach to the tasks described in this SOW. The technical proposal shall also relate the Contractor’s previous experience related to the following areas to his/her ability to perform the tasks describe in this SOW:

a.	Experience dealing with host government officials, business or academic leaders in the Middle East in the areas specified in this SOW.

The technical proposal is not to exceed 5 pages.

Factor B – Price

The price evaluation will determine whether the proposed prices are realistic, complete, and reasonable in relation to the requirement in the SOW.  The offeror shall provide a firm fixed price quote that includes all direct and indirect costs associated with the work requested in this SOW.  

11. 	PRICE/TECHNICAL PROPOSAL TRADE-OFF

The Government will perform the price/technical tradeoff of each proposal to determine which proposal represent the “best value” to the Government, price/cost and other factors considered.  “Best value” is defined as the offer that results in the most advantageous acquisition decision for the Government.  Technical quality in proposals is more important than price/cost.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest evaluated price/cost.  The analysis of all proposals will be performed through an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis between technical and price/cost factors.  Where proposals are essentially equal technically, price/cost becomes much more important.

The Government may enter into discussions if it deems discussions to be necessary; however, the Offeror shall assume that the Government will not enter discussions before awarding the contract.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled “Solicitation for Information and Planning Purposes.”  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is the first mission under the Living With a Star program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA’s understanding of the solar process and space weather.  SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  It will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees.  SDO will have a mission life of 5 years, and is currently scheduled for launch in April 2008. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is soliciting comments on requirements established regarding the SDO Propulsion Subsystem Pyrovalves.	The present requirements are specified in the attached documents: Exhibit 1 – Statement of Work (SOW) for Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project Propulsion Subsystem Pyrovalves (464-PROP-LEGL-0051), Exhibit 2 – Performance Specification for Propulsion Subsystem Pyrovalves (SDO) (464-PROP-SPEC-0090) and Exhibit 3 - SDO Project Propulsion Subsystem Pyrovalves Deliverable Items List and Schedule (DILS). This notice is issued by the NASA GSFC to post a draft SOW and Specification via the Internet, and to solicit input and recommendations from interested parties.  The objective of this RFI is to gather information that promotes competition and increases procurement efficiency by improving NASA GSFC’s knowledge of industry’s capabilities.  NASA GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that may be used to determine eligibility to be participants in feedback sessions with the SDO project.  This procedure is described in FAR Part 15.202.  The intent of the sessions is to provide dialogue in which participants can provide feedback on NASA GSFC requirements, Deliverable Items and Schedule, and its acquisition approach.  The compilation of submitted information may be factored along with SDO requirements to refine the aforementioned SOW (Exhibit 1) and Performance Specification (Exhibit 2). Potential offerors are requested to submit information in the form of a brief Capabilities and Qualifications Statement that should include three components:  1) Capability to comply with the present requirements outlined in the Performance Specification and SOW.	(Requirements that are not in compliance should be noted with brief comment that either describes how a potential offeror’s pyrovalves could be brought into compliance or state the potential offeror’s position on such a requirement.  This would serve as a main topic in one-on-one feedback sessions.  It should also be stated whether certain requirements are cost drivers or increase risk and whether or not a fixed-price contract would be acceptable.)   2) Capability to meet the hardware deliverable items and schedule. 3) Summary of past relevant experience in developing Propulsion Subsystem Pyrovalves.  Please advise if this requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in Internet “Note A”. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. This notice constitutes all information concerning the SDO Propulsion Subsystem Pyrovalves that will be furnished at this time.  Interested firms are requested to submit their capability statements to Mr. John T. McCain, by email at John.T.McCain@nasa.gov  no later than the response date indicated above.  Documents, comments, and questions may be forwarded to Mr. McCain via electronic transmission or by facsimile transmission.  In addition, copies of all documents shall also be forwarded to Mr. Jon Lewis, at NASA GSFC, Mail Code 597, Greenbelt, MD  20771, or by e-mail at Jon.M.Lewis@nasa.gov.  When responding reference the number above (e.g., SDO-PSLV-GAA-0001). This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.	Respondents will not be notified of the final results from the one-on-one discussions.  An ombudsman has been appointed—See NASA Specific Note “B”.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 2000 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA GSFC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Edward V Wallace, Contract Specialist,  504-697-2580
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Command Systems Center New Orleans (SSC NOLA) has developed an enterprise data warehouse (EDW).  The enterprise being served is N1 Manpower and Personnel Navy.  The main purpose of the EDW is to provide efficient and effective reporting and support tactical and strategic decision-making for Headquarters staff, program managers, decision makers, and fleet units. Personnel, manpower, and financial information from multiple legacy information systems (IS) and other data sources are periodically loaded into the data warehouse and the data made available to end-users via the data marts.  These data marts currently supply information to their respective customers via commercial reporting and ad hoc applications.  Each data mart has a specific purpose and has views and reports developed with commercial packages, mainly Business Objects.  (See Attachment A for the EDW Design Document). There are plans to add additional data marts.  There will be additional feeds to the data warehouse from authoritative data sources and interfaces.  These plans are broken into separate projects with multiple phases. ·     The first project will provide retention data through a web-based graphical user interface (GUI). ·     The second project provides data pertaining to sailors? career through both reporting and ad-hoc queries. ·     The third and fourth projects provide reports using various graphical representations (pie and bar charts, dashboards, etc.) used in Distribution and Readiness Briefs for the officer and enlisted Navy. Each of these reports requires drill through and drill-down capabilities, as well as, providing alerts and email triggers when thresholds are exceeded. Due to the factors outlined above, we are seeking information regarding technology and technical approaches to address these requirements.  We require canned reporting and ad-hoc query capabilities with the ability to manually alter data without impacting or changing the data stored in the data warehouse or data marts. The alteration and adjustment of the data is required on the face of the report and displays themselves prior to presenting the results to those above the individuals in the chain-of-command that make the alterations and adjustments.  This would also include storing the manually altered data for historical purposes and the retrieval of this historical data for trend analysis in reporting. On the other hand, the EDW will continue to be updated by the legacy IS.  As time progresses, there is a strong possibility of data varying between the EDW and that altered by users of projects three and four.  We require the ability to readily identify these differences. Ideally, the solution would be all encompassing, preferably a tightly, integrated solution, but information on all solutions is solicited. This RFI requests information on architectures, interoperability, object and data models, interfaces, etc. of existing Data Warehouse (DW) technology.  Refer to Attachment 1 for the EDW Design Document.  Appendices have been removed from the EDW Design Document for simplicity and lack of relevance to this effort. Responses to this RFI are due by 4:00 PM on November 22, 2004.  See section 3.0 for further details.

<DESC>GovWorks on the behalf of the United States Agency of International Development (USAID) intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to The World Environment Center Inc. Washington, DC.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the (USAID). USAID is seeking the assistance of a contractor to promote sustainable development by promoting the best industrial practices and improving efficiency among developing country small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Working with potential Fortune 100 companies, the USAID/EGAT Bureau seeks to develop a public-private partnership effort customized to USAID Mission strategies.  This partnership program will target the thousands of SMEs in the developing world who supply, or are otherwise affiliated with, these large multinational corporations.  The program will leverage these companies' best practices, strategic approaches, software, and business tools in an effort to improve SME efficiency and productivity and develop their knowledge infrastructure.  WEC is the only entity that possesses the unique combination of relevant background experience and committed US fortune 100 private sector contacts necessary to conduct the proposed activities in a timely and efficient manner.  Developing projects of this manner with any other entity would involve (1) additional expense; (2) additional time, as that entity would need to pursue its own steep learning curve; (3) delays in program implementation; (4) inefficiency, as we would fail to capture the knowledge base and experience that WEC has built up through its body of work to date in this area.  Therefore it has been determined that no other vendor other than World Environment Center Inc meets the requirements. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST November 12, 2004 will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>38 -- ONLINE REPRESENTATIONS & CERTIFICATIONS (ORCA)
<DESC>ORCA NOTICE TO ALL CIVIL ENGINEERING UNIT OAKLAND CONTRACTORS:

The use of Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) will soon become mandatory, based on upcoming Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) language (FAR Case 2002-024), with the start of the new fiscal year on 1 October 2004. 

ORCA was developed as part of the Business Partner Network (BPN), which is a component of the Integrated Acquisition Environment E-Gov initiative. It is a web-based system that centralizes, standardizes, and moves the collection and storing of FAR level representations and certifications online.  The change to the FAR, effective 1 October 2004, will require representations and certifications to be completed and updated at least annually by vendors on-line through the ORCA.  

Contractors are required to have an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) prior to registering in ORCA.   ORCA is pre-populated with information found in CCR and the remaining reps and certs information is collected in the form of a questionnaire.  Solicitation and agency specific representations and certifications may still be used and collected in Section K of the solicitations.  

 Further Information on this initiative may be obtained from the ORCA website at http://www.bpn.gov/orca.  This help menu includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and the ORCA Handbook and contact information for questions. Furthermore, a copy of the proposed final rule is attached.  

The Office of the Secretary of Defense, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy Electronic Business (OSD/DPAP-EB) and the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) will be conducting outreach and notification to vendors by bulk email to active registrants in CCR, by FedBizOpps notice, and through a posting on the CCR website. However, we request you engage in outreach and notification actions within the contracting community, and assist in disseminating this information to current and potential vendors.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE A MATERIAL AND METHOD FOR REMOVING AQUEOUS PHASE METALS 


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's aerogel/Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) composite solid materials and method for removing metals from aqueous media.

Scientists at LLNL have invented solid materials to remove contaminating metals and organic compounds from aqueous media. The contaminants are removed by passing the metals in an aqueous or vapor phase through the solids in molded, granular or powder form. The solids adsorb the metals and the organics leaving a purified aqueous stream. The species-specific adsorption occurs through specific chemical modifications of the solids tailored toward the contaminant(s). The contaminated solids can then be disposed of or the contaminant can be removed and the solids recycled.

The materials can be used to clean-up any aqueous stream with environmentally damaging materials such as ground water with uranium, hexavalent chromium, or other heavy metal contamination, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contamination, ground water or surface waters with petroleum product contamination or fuel spills, and waste storage tanks.   Another use is metal recovery.  An aerogel/GAC composite solid material is also capable of adsorbing aqueous phase gold. 

LLNL has a patent pending on the method and materials.  LLNL is seeking industrial partners to commercialize the invention. LLNL is also interested in a collaborative research partnership to improve the invention and to explore other applications for the invention. 

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in developing and commercializing LLNL's technology for removing metals from aqueous media and/or a collaborative research partnership should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and Address
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology

Written responses should be directed to:

<DESC> Notice of Intent: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements”, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is planning to issue a short term (not to exceed 90 days) sole-source contract to ensure the continuity of courier services for the Center for Federal Investigative Services (CFIS) and the Center for Retirement and Insurance Services (CRIS) co-located in Boyers, PA and the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The current vendor, VGA Enterprises 14625 Baltimore Ave., Suite 228, Laurel, MD, 20707, is the only responsible source at this time that has personnel qualified to carry out the courier service to the CFIS and CRIS locations due to the background investigation requirements imposed under 5CFR 731 and 736 with a sensitivity designation level of Critical Sensitive. It is not reasonably possible to clear new vendor personnel by the expiration date of the existing contract; the time period it takes to clear personnel with the sensitivity designation of Critical Sensitive is 35 days or longer. It is critical to the CFIS and CRIS missions that the courier service is maintained without delay during the acquisition process to implement a long term courier solution. Therefore, VGA Enterprises is the intended source for this short term requirement. The anticipated contract action for this service is not anticipated to be greater than $100,000. OPM deems it appropriate to award a fixed-price contract on other than a full and open competitive basis. Only one responsible source is available and no other types of services will satisfy the needs of the Agency. The North American Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for action is 492110, Couriers. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. All interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement may submit in writing a substantive statement specifying their ability to meet this requirement to be received within 15 days of publication of this Notice to: U. S. Office of Personnel Management, Center for Federal Investigative Services, 1137 Branchton Rd., Boyers, PA  16018-0618; Attn.: Bradley Holtzapple @ (724)794-5612 or fax (724)794-1152

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>Description
The Virginia Contracting Activity is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches and concepts to obtain unique and creative solutions, technologies, and state of the art approaches within five unclassified Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) technical thrust areas: Radar, Electro-Optic, Material, Geo-physical, and Radio frequency (RF).  Six classified technical mission area descriptions will be provided to prospective offerors possessing the required level of clearance.  The BAA is structured to satisfy six classified MASINT mission areas through R&D within the five unclassified MASINT technical thrust areas.  Concept white papers should explore and quantify improvements in the primary areas of: Radar, Electro-Optic (Infrared Spectral sensing lasers), Material (chemical and biological), Geo-physical (seismic, acoustic and magnetic monitoring) and Radio Frequency (unintentional emanations).  The white papers are to use the unclassified MASINT thrust areas to satisfy the six classified mission areas.  The program office’s primary mission is to conduct detailed technical target studies and lead development of transformational MASINT technologies from development through end-to-end operational transition, using a disciplined approach that fosters innovation and reduced cycle time, in short, they develop and operationally demonstrate MASINT technology.  Note: white papers submitted under BAA-04-01-JT1 or 05-01-JT2, should not be resubmitted under this BAA.

Government POCs: Contracting Officer: Ms. Jody Tully, 1030 South Highway A1A, Building 989, Patrick AFB FL 32925, telephone: (321) 494-9739, email: jody.tully@patrick.af.mil.  Program Manager: Maj. Frank Barrow, 1030 South Highway A1A, Building 989, Patrick AFB FL 32925, telephone: (321) 494-4648, email: franklin.barrow@patrick.af.mil.  Contractors should submit their request for the classified data package to Ms. Susan Engel, e-mail:susan.engel@Patrick.af.mil.  All other requests for information shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.    

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a two (2) to four (4) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution for the relevant mission areas(s). The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  The White Paper should include the White Paper Cover Sheet (attachment 1), containing the anticipated period of performance as well as a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any.  It is a best guess of the anticipated cost of the effort.  The ROM should be consistent with any dollar value or ranges specified in the announcement, as well as the level of work being proposed.  The White Paper does not include a cost proposal.  It must include a short technical description of the concepts and planned approach to accomplish an operational demonstration and the technical objectives.  It briefly describes the technologies to be pursued in the effort.  The White Paper must also include past performance data (attachment to 2-4 page white paper), in accordance with the attached instructions (attachment 2).  

White papers found to be consistent with the requirements of the BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract.  Complete proposal instructions will be contained in the invitation to submit a proposal.

This MASINT Transitional BAA is open and effective for a period of four years from the date of release (estimated 1 Nov 04-01 Oct 08), and is open to all interested parties, including FFRDC, Government, National, and academic (college and university) laboratories.  It is recommended that white papers be received by May of each year to maximize the possibility of award.  White papers will be accepted at any time, but technical review may be delayed due to the end of year priorities, and it is less likely that funding will be available late in each respective Government Fiscal Year.  The cost of preparing Government requested proposals, in response to this announcement, is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. 

The white paper must be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Company name, Period of performance, Estimated cost of task (see attachment 1); Section B: Task Objective and relevant mission areas(s) being addressed; and Section C: Technical summary of objectives and the operational demonstration.  Multiple white papers, within the purview of this announcement, may be submitted by offerors.  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12-pitch.  Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a), and in accordance with the approved MASINT security guide.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address (both unclassified and classified if available) with their submission. Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for contract award.  All white paper responses to this announcement must be addressed to: Jody Tully, AE-2, 1030 South Highway A1A, Building 989, Patrick AFB FL 32925-3002.  E-mailed white paper submissions are not accepted.  E-mailed questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors, during the white paper proposal development phase of this acquisition, should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer and must reference the title and BAA-05-01-JT2 number.
 
CRITERIA: The evaluation of white papers and proposals will be performed utilizing the following criteria, in conjunction with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Mission Capability-with sub areas; Scientific/Technical Merit, Operational Feasibility, Operational Readiness and Qualifications & Capabilities.  The Mission capability criteria and sub-areas will evaluate the offerors improved ability to satisfy specific mission area requirements, the ability to operationally field the technology, their knowledge, skills and technical expertise in the field of MASINT R&D, and the ability to rapidly respond to operational needs.  (2) Relevant Past & Present performance, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government/commercial contracts, and (3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal that shall be considered. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of negotiated contracts. Options are discouraged and un-priced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in Nov 04. Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging between $100,000 to $3 million per year. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA, from Nov 04-Nov 08, is over $1000 million.  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require up to a TOP-SECRET-SCI clearance or the means to support a special access security environment, facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to U.S. SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. These offerors should immediately contact the contracting officer for information if they contemplate responding.  

The program office has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  Contractors from ZelTech, CTI, and EWA have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  They may be used to support comprehensive proposal understanding. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. This BAA is open and effective until 01 Oct 08.
