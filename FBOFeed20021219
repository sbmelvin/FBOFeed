<DESC>The Division of Blood Diseases and Resources of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) seeks contractors to develop novel somatic cellular therapies that will aid investigators by providing support in areas ranging from basic science to animal studies to proof-of-principle and eventually human trials.  This project will involve a) an administrative center (to be awarded under a separate RFP); and b) up to three somatic cell therapy processing facilities.  A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will be issued requesting proposals for the somatic cell therapy processing facilities in which awards will be made, each with varying technical/scientific approaches, for the production of clinical grade reagents.  There are four research and technical objectives:  1) to provide for rapid, safe, and equable transition of basic research ideas in clinical practice; 2) to develop and implement procedures for the evaluation, prioritization, and processing of requests for service; 3) to prepare programs or mechanisms to facilitate the training and development of junior investigators in areas of cell therapy clinical studies/manufacturing with a focus on clinical grade reagent production and FDA regulatory procedures; and 4) to process, store, ship, and analyze reagents produced by the facility.  Additional somatic cell processing facility project requirements are: 1) with the assistance of the administrative center, develop and prepare protocols and standards of procedures for each request for services and develop, obtain, and maintain any IND or IDE required for manufactured cellular therapies; 2) participate in developing a manual of procedures; 3) prepare reports; 4) assure prompt accumulation, entry, and editing of product-related data; 5) report all adverse events; 6) provide protocol information, including quality control and quality assurance methods, to the administrative center; 7) participate in the analysis and writing of study manuscripts and reports; 8) prepare archival samples to be sent to repository; 9) maintain inventories of reagents produced; 10) participate in site visits to be conducted jointly by the administrative center and NHLBI staff; and 11) participate as a member of the steering committee. It is anticipated that up to three cost reimbursement type contracts will be awarded on or about September 30, 2003.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP).  BAA NHLBI-HB-03-06 will be available on or about January 2, 2003 and may be accessed at the following URL location:  http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp.  No paper copies of the RFP will be available.  Note:  The RFP for the somatic cell administrative center will be available on or about January 2, 2003 under RFP NHLBI-HB-03-07.

(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSC&#64979;POL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

(b)	The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory (DPSC&#64979;POL #215&#64979;'737&#64979;7052) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d) 	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                                       ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                                              ].
	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                                ].

* When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                                          ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                                                ].
	TEST CHARACTERISTICS: [                                                              ].

(f) 	It is solely the prime contractor's responsibility to schedule QL testing and to obtain test reports. The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.

(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be deferred pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.

(h) 	Shade evaluation is acceptance testing. Therefore, component lots may not be shipped to the prime contractor until the DPSC Laboratory accepts the shade of the material.		

FPI 1000F1, Delivery Order - Orders shall customarily be made by phone, with subsequent written confirmation containing the following information:

a.  Date of order
b.  Contract number and order number

<SUBJECT>58 -- ECP for TSA Retrofit applicable to ALE-50
<SOLNBR>F09603-03-Q-52338
<RESPDATE>013003
<CONTACT>Salena Arrington, Contract Specialist, Phone (478)926-7000, Fax (478)926-7211, Email Salena.Arrington@robins.af.mil
<DESC>The proposed contract action is to obtain an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) for the Transient Suppression Assembly (TSA) retrofit for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source Raytheon, Goleta CA (MC 06129) under authority of FAR 6.302.  The AN/ALE-50(V) is a towed decoy system designed to increase the survivability of tactical aircraft by sufficiently decoying radar-guided missile threats away from host platforms.  When employed on F-16 aircraft, the ALE-50 is carried in, deployed from, and controlled by 1x2 (one launcher containing two decoys) launcher controllers (LCs).  Early versions (production lots 1, 2 and 3) of the 1x2 LC have experienced numerous failures during operational use due to Electro Static Discharge (ESD) energy dissipation.  A TSA has been designed to protect LCs from ESD damage, and was incorporated into production lots 4 and subsequent.  However, 668 early version LCs have been fielded and require retrofit with TSA assemblies in order to ensure their continued viability during operational use.  In order to retrofit early version LCs with TSA assemblies, the government requires an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to describe and provide the process.   The present effort is to initiate and obtain the ECP required for the TSA retrofit.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

The solicitation document contains information that has a military or space application. Only businesses that have been certified by the Department of Defense and have a valid need to know may have a copy of the solicitation document. All requests for copies of the solicitation document must include a certified copy of DD Form 2345. To
request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call the Defense Logistics Services Center on 800/352/3572. This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space  application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that  are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a  legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their  current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To  request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or  call DLSC at the above number. The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. MOU  country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued. Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified above for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Kathy Cames, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.

Program Research and Develop Announcement (PRDA) 
for National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF)
Vessel Defueling/Removal and Tank Cleaning Solutions

Description:
The U.S. Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), South Atlantic Region, maintains ships stowage facilities for merchant and Navy ships at the James River Reserve Fleet (JRRF), located on the James River at Fort Eustis, VA. These ships have become obsolete due to age and contain various amounts of fuels, oil, lubricants, oily water and ballast water in their tanks.  Some of the fuel tanks have leaks due to steel deterioration. 

MARAD is seeking innovative technical/management approaches to the environmentally safe and economically feasible defueling and removal of all petroleum products, as well as tank cleaning operations of obsolete vessels. (A complete listing of the vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A. This list of ships is subject to change.)  In addition to conventional fuel removal and disposal and tank cleaning techniques, innovative solutions are invited that employ modern environmentally safe technology, including, but not limited to, safe chemical or bio-remediation techiques that dispose of residual fuel and other petroleum products.  Note that some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.

Offerors may respond to one or both parts (i.e., defueling and/or tank cleaning) for any or all of the obsolete vessels listed on Attachment A.  Upon award, offerors will be required to identify the types of petroleum products, total quantity of the product, chemical analysis of the product, and the proposed methods of removal for the petroleum products from the vessel and their subsequent transportation to a disposal or recycling facility.  MARAD anticipates that the costs of this project will be partially offset by the resale value of the fuel or petroleum product.

Opportunities for Fleet Site Visits
MARAD has established two periods, January 27-29, 2003 and May 19-21, 2003, for interested parties to visit the JRRF and view the ships listed in Attachment A.  MARAD requests those interested in visiting the JRRF contact the point of contact (POC) not later than Friday, January 10, 2003 to register for the January 27-29 fleet site visit and not later than Friday, May 2, 2003 to register for the May 19-21 fleet sit visit.  The POC will request information regarding the identity of the visitors and information regarding the company/organization the visitor represents, and assign a time for the visit. The JRRF POC is Mr. Mike Bagley (757) 887-3233 Ext. 0, e-mail sharon.nesbit@marad.dot.gov.

Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to this PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

?Y Innovative technical/management approaches for the environmentally safe and economically feasible defueling and/or tank cleaning of the vessels identified in Attachment A 
?Y Methodology for identifying the types, total quantity, chemical analysis, as well as the  removal and disposal of the petroleum products
?Y Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
?Y Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with fuel removal and/or tank cleaning on obsolete vessels
?Y Funding requirements associated with the proposed approach

In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

?Y Feasibility and likelihood of success of technical/management approach for the removal/disposal of petroleum products and/or tank cleaning of the vessels identified in Attachment A and the risks associated with the proposed approach
?Y Economic feasibility of the proposed approach(es) including schedule/cost assessments
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed methodology for identification and chemical analysis of petroleum products
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed removal/disposal of petroleum products and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the removal/disposal of fuel/petroleum products and/or tank cleaning of obsolete vessels
?Y Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed technical/management approach(es)

In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price. 

The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate the implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as to provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised and are considered confidential.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or all of the proposal(s) to implement the innovative solutions offered. The Government has the right to select or refuse any or all of the offers. 

Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals:
To be given evaluation consideration, submissions in response to this PRDA must conform to the following standards:

1. Technical/production/management solutions, inclusive of the listing below,  shall not exceed 25 typewritten pages, single sided, single spaced, Arial, 12 pitch:
?Y Production throughput/capacity
?Y Environmentally safe considerations
?Y Petroleum product abatement considerations
?Y Requisite experience

2. Funding/pricing requirements must be proposed in sufficient detail to show all anticipated costs associated with the removal/disposal of fuel and petroleum products, and/or tank cleaning of the vessel(s).  Pricing information must be detailed enough to permit the Government to make a determination of cost realism and reasonableness when assessed against the proposed approach(es). Offerors must state how long their proposed prices and costs are valid for.

Submission of pricing information shall not exceed 3 typewritten pages, single sided, single-spaced, Arial, 12 pitch.

Individual offeror??s may submit multiple proposals.  Each proposal must be separable and conform to the above criteria and instructions.

<DESC>DARPA Mission, 
The DARPA mission is to develop imaginative, innovative and often high-risk research ideas offering a significant technological impact that will go well beyond the normal evolutionary developmental approaches; and, to pursue these ideas from the demonstration of technical feasibility through the development of prototype systems.

FutureMAP Program Objectives, 

Strategic decisions depend upon the accurate assessment of the likelihood of future events.  This analysis often requires independent contributions by experts in a wide variety of fields, with the resulting difficulty of combining the various opinions into one assessment.  The FutureMAP program at DARPA is investigating the use of markets and market-like mechanisms in aggregating information from diverse multiple sources.  Specifically this will involve (a) defining and running demonstration markets for proof-of-concept, (b) conducting analytical studies to develop new market structures and features of interest to the DoD, (c) designing and running a laboratory testbed to evaluate and validate market structures, and (d) conducting red team exercises to ensure robustness.  Additionally, FutureMAP will investigate ancillary topics such as incentives for participation, the use of information markets in conjunction with natural markets, and regulatory and logistical issues.

We have two efforts ongoing, and would like to complement these with a few small studies.  These small studies might cover topics that are currently not being investigated by the DARPA projects, or they might provide additional oversight and analysis of challenges faced by the two ongoing efforts. We would welcome proposals for small projects, not to exceed $100,000 in cost, that might complement these two ongoing lines of work.

One of the ongoing efforts, at Neoteric Technologies (http://www.neotek-al.com/) is defining and managing markets to answer specific questions of interest to the DoD.  Typically these markets will have a small number of invited participants who will bring their information together through the market mechanism.  We envision markets of 15 to 20 participants addressing questions about the probabilities of specific kinds of failure within our national infrastructure.  The results from these markets would be used as input to further analytical steps, perhaps within the context of Bayesian networks.

The other ongoing effort, at Net Exchange (http://www.nex.com) is defining and managing long-running markets based on data series that are available from independent news and intelligence sources.  The markets will allow the trading of futures on composite securities that express changes in combinations of series.  Composite securities provide a participant, who has insight into interrelations among basic securities, with a means of expressing this insight and benefiting from the expression if correct.  A simple composite is an intersection between two basic securities; e.g., the probability that a decrease in Country X GDP will coincide with an increase in Country X civil unrest.

Request for Price Quotes: Hourly Rate plus Expenses	 	STATEMENT OF WORK 	Field Support for Wyoming 	Public Water System Regulatory Program Purpose 	The purpose of this contract is to procure field services for the Wyoming public water system (PWS) regulatory  program. Background 	The National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (40 CFR Part 141) require all PWSs to routinely monitor for microbiological, chemical and radionuclide contaminants, and to meet certain treatment technique requirements.  The PWS regulatory program is implemented by the U. S.  EPA Region VIII office in Denver, CO.   	As implementing agency for the Wyoming PWS regulatory program, EPA Region VIII has several responsibilities.  Some of these require personnel to make site visits to Wyoming PWSs, or to have face-to-face meetings with Wyoming's state and local environmental  or public health agency officials.   For instance: (1)	EPA is required to ensure that sanitary surveys are conducted at each PWS within specified regulatory time-frames.  A sanitary survey is a thorough on-site review of PWS facilities, operation, maintenance and management that emphasizes  technical assistance rather than enforcement.  Sanitary surveys also require collection and interpretation of select information before the on-site visit. (2)	As part of a technical assistance effort, EPA Regional staff collect water samples for microscopic particulate analysis (MPA).  These MPA  samples are used to determine whether a PWS using a ground water source might be "under the direct influence of surface water." (3)	When a PWS is having problems with microbiological, chemical, or radionuclide contamination, the operator often asks EPA for assistance in correcting the problem.   The assistance may necessitate a visit to the PWS. (4)	There may be some small water systems in Wyoming that meet the definition of a public water system, but have not been notified by EPA.  These systems need to be identified and their names entered into the PWS regulatory database at  EPA. (5)	The 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments enacted several new requirements for public water systems.  Water system operators may need on-site technical assistance and training to comply with the new requirements. (6)	Some state, county, and local environmental and public health  agencies also have regulatory authority that applies to water systems in Wyoming.  On occasion, staff  from these agencies have requested training on drinking water topics.  It is in the interest of EPA Region VIII to provide this training to help ensure that all agencies work together in a  coordinated manner. (7)	On occasion, it is necessary to confirm that a PWS has actually completed all the steps necessary to allow it to be "deactivated" (i.e., no longer meets the legal definition of a "public water system").  It is also occasionally necessary to confirm that a PWS has completed  all of the actions mandated in an administrative order.  In both instances, the best way to make these confirmations is to visit the facility, take photographs, and possibly collect water samples. (8)	As appropriate, EPA Region 8 also investigate problems at private residences, or at facilities  too small to meet the legal definition of a public water system.  Regional staffs provide technical assistance to help these small water systems correct any water quality problems. 	Because EPA Region VIII is located in Denver, it is difficult to send Agency personnel to Wyoming every time one of  these actions are needed.  For this reason, the Region is soliciting proposals from contractors.  The majority of the work will be located in the Eastern part of Wyoming. Responsibilities 	The contractor will receive written (FAXed or e-mailed) assignments from the contract's Work Assignment  Manager for the some or all of the following seven tasks: (1)	Site visits to public water systems to conduct sanitary surveys. 	At the beginning of the contract year, the Work Assignment Manager will send the contractor a list of Wyoming PWSs that must have sanitary surveys completed.  After  receiving the list, the contractor will conduct the sanitary surveys at the assigned facilities and prepare a written report for each one.  The scheduling of these survey visits is left to the discretion of the contractor.  However, EPA reserves the right to designate certain surveys as "high  priority".  "High priority" surveys must be completed as soon as possible.  All of the sanitary survey visits must be completed by January 31, 2004.  	The contractor will prepare a written report for each sanitary survey.  The reports must have the following features: ?	They must use a  standardized format specified by EPA Region VIII, and they must be provided in a WordPerfect format. ?	They must include at least one color photo of each source, treatment and storage facility at the public water system. ?	They must include an updated schematic of the PWS, which shows any changes  made in system configurations.  EPA Region VIII will provide the contractor with a paper copy of each schematic before the contractor makes the site visit.  It is then the responsibility of the contractor to mark-up the schematic as appropriate, and get the PWS operator's signature on the page (to  confirm that he/she agrees with the changes). ?	The text at the end of the report (the "summary" section) must include a brief summary of any deficiencies found at the facility, and some recommendations on how to correct them. ?	For each sanitary survey completed at public water systems that use  ground water, the contractor must fill out a "ground water under the direct influence of surface water" screening form.  The screening form will be provided by EPA. ?	For each sanitary survey, the contractor must mark-up a PWS inventory summary form that will be provided by  EPA. ?	Latitude/longitude measurements will be collected only if there has never been a measurement previously determined for a system's source(s), treatment facility(ies), and/or storage tank(s).  Measurements will only be recorded on the PWS inventory summary sheet.  The contractor must  demonstrate to the Work Assignment Manager that they can collect latitude/longitude measurements to within 25 meters of accuracy. 	Each sanitary survey report must be e-mailed to the contract's Work Assignment Manager within 30 days after the site visit.  The accompanying photos can either be  e-mailed (e.g., those from a digital camera) as a separate file attachment, or mailed.  The hand-corrected PWS schematics, inventory summary sheets, and any other pertinent information collected during the survey, e.g. treatment equipment manufacturer's spec sheets,  must be mailed back to the Work  Assignment Manager. 	If, during a sanitary survey visit, the contractor discovers conditions at a public water system that could pose an immediate risk to public health, he/she will immediately contact the Work Assignment Manager by telephone to provide a report of the situation.  The contractor  will also give highest priority to the completion of the sanitary survey report and relaying it to the Work Assignment Manager by e-mail. 	There may be occasion when a representative of the EPA, state, county, or local agencies will accompany the contractor during a sanitary survey.  In these  instances, the contractor will still be responsible for the completion of the sanitary survey report. (2)	Site visits to public water systems to collect drinking water samples for microscopic particulate analysis.  After receiving a written work request from the Work Assignment Manager, the  contractor will collect the MPA samples using the protocols specified in the "EPA Consensus Method."  Each sample takes approximately 8 - 10 hours to collect.  Once the sample is collected, the contractor will package it and either hand-deliver or mail it to a certified laboratory (one that has  been approved by EPA to conduct the analysis).  For each site visit, the contractor will prepare a brief (i.e., no more than one page) report using a form approved by EPA..  The reports will be sent to EPA within 30 days after the site visits.  (NOTE: The public water system pays the lab costs for  the MPA analysis.  It is understood that the lab may send the results to EPA later than the 30-day deadline.) (3)	Technical assistance visits to public water systems that are having problems.  After receiving a written work request from the Work Assignment Manager, the contractor will visit a  facility to provide technical assistance.  Examples of possible problems include microbiological contamination in the system; failure to maintain adequate disinfectant residual; and failure to meet the Surface Water Treatment Rule turbidity criteria.  The contractor will assess the problem and  offer suggestions on how to make corrections. 	For each site visit, the contractor will prepare a brief report (i.e., no more than 2 pages) for EPA.  These reports will include findings and suggestions on how to correct problems at the facility.  The reports will be sent to EPA within 30 days  after the site visit. 	On occasion, the contractor may receive a written request to visit a water system that does not meet the legal definition of a public water system.  In these instances, the contractor will visit the facility, offer advice on how to correct the problem, and prepare a brief  report for the Work Assignment Manager. (4)	Identification of potential PWSs that are not currently on EPA's inventory of regulated systems.  This task can be accomplished while traveling to assigned sites.  Here, the contractor is requested to watch for any new facility developments that might  meet the definition of a public water system, and to report these systems to EPA.  (EPA will provide the contractor with a current list of existing PWSs.) (5)	Training and technical assistance on the 1996 SDWA Amendments.  After receiving a written work request from the Work Assignment Manager,  the contractor will provide training or technical assistance to PWSs that are striving to meet the new drinking water regulatory requirements.  After each training or technical assistance visit, the contractor will send the Work Assignment Manager written confirmation (preferably an e-mail) that  the assignment was completed and a description of the training provided. (6)	Training for state and local agency personnel.  At the written request of the Work Assignment Manager, the contractor will conduct one or more training sessions for state and local agency personnel on selected drinking  water topics.  Examples: How to collect a total coliform sample; chemical monitoring requirements for PWSs. (7)	Site visits to confirm completion of specified actions.  At the written request of the Work Assignment Manager, the contractor will visit PWS facilities, take photos and collect other  pertinent information to confirm that a PWS has completed the actions either: (1) mandated in a administrative order; or (2) necessary to allow that PWS to be deactivated.  The contractor will send EPA a summary report within 30 days after the visit. End of Contract Reporting 	At the end of the  contract period, the contractor will prepare a brief (i.e., only a few pages, at the most) report summarizing how many tasks were completed under each of the areas of responsibility listed above.  Additional reporting requirements are specified under specific areas of responsibility. Additional  Requirements (1)	For all site visits, the contractor will inform the PWS operator that they are contract employees (not EPA employees) who have been hired by EPA to provide various forms of technical assistance.  At all times, the contractor will be courteous to the PWS operators and will suggest,  but not insist, that the PWS operators follow advice given during the visit.  (2)	If the contractor observes that a PWS is not complying with any of the drinking water regulations or, if conditions at the facility pose an immediate public health risk, the contractor will immediately inform the  Work Assignment Manager. (3)	Some written work requests will require an expedited response, particularly in the case of drinking water emergencies. (4)	All work performed by the contractor will be done in accordance with pertinent Occupational Safety and Health Administration  requirements. (5)	EPA may require the contractor to travel to Denver near the beginning of the contract year to meet staff and review files of facilities where sanitary survey visits will be conducted. Duration of contract 	The contract will be in place from the award date until January 31,  2004. Billing 	The contractor will submit monthly invoices to EPA which list the number of hours and expenses.  All hourly charges must be for field work, or for any activities associated with field work (such as travel, per diem, lab analyses of drinking water samples, report preparation,  xeroxing, photo development, and postage).  Unless prior written approval is obtained by the Work Assignment Manager, this contract will not fund any administrative or indirect charges, including QA review of the reports by anyone other than the field personnel.  All indirect charges must be  considered in the proposed hourly rate.  All expenses will be itemized and must be in accordance with EPA cost reimbursement policies. 	All travel and per diem charges must be made at the same rates as those allowed EPA personnel.

<DESC>NASA/HQ plans to issue a sole-source Request for Quotation (RFQ) to Corporate Leadership Council (CLC) Solutions under the authority of Only One Responsible Source, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). In regards to the Human Resources (HR) issues and trends that are facing government and private sector areas of Human Resources, NASA is seeking a review of the work completed on its workforce planning and the Recruitment Initiative. In addition to the review NASA is seeking support on the efforts to implement and measure the strategies and tools to advance its initiatives.  This will provide NASA with the ability to develop an effective employment brand for targeted employee groups and centers, understand NASA's distinctive strengths as an employer, and leverage cost-effective opportunities to build on existing strengths and improve on areas of opportunity. The requirements include developing a project plan, milestones, and outcomes which requires one to interview key managers to identify workforce management issues and key assumptions and perceptions that drive current management approaches and systems.  Design a web based diagnostic tool that includes a survey that will provide a baseline for future comparisons, and measure the impact of strategies and tools designed through the NRI to attract and retain high quality employees.  Provide ongoing support after completion of the survey for up to one year from the start date of the contract, and a detailed analysis to establish baseline metrics to identify employee commitment and engagement, measure employee preferences and career drivers, and identify strategies to optimize employee recruitment and retention.   The government plans to award a sole-source purchase order to Corporate Leadership Council (CLC) for these specialized services.  NASA's membership with CLC Solutions has laid the foundation for much of their recruitment strategies and tools currently in use, and CLC Solutions provides a means to assess the effectiveness of these efforts.	CLC's unique proprietary diagnostic tool-the Employee Preference Survey (EPS) provides benchmarking capabilities and some customization for NASA's unique data that will provide a comprehensive assessment of the relative value of our its employees place on different employment/retention and work-life incentives.  Without the EPS, NASA will not have an effective and relevant survey instrument of collecting critical assessment data that will drive HR management decisions and programs in NASA. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 24, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin
GS05P02GBC0001

The Bid Due Date for the Renovation and Modernization of the Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (GS05P02GBC0001) has been extended to January 14, 2003, 2:00 p.m. Chicago time.

The following are questions asked at the pre-bid conference held December 12, 2002 in Milwaukee.

1.	Will the contractor be able to schedule another site walk through after the initial pre-bid site visit on December 12?  If so, please provide the contact name and number to coordinate this. Building walkthroughs after December 12 may be scheduled by calling Don Westman at 414-297-1269.
 
2.	Is there an Elevator #7?  No. It was eliminated several years back and re-numbering was not done.

3.	What is the anticipated completion date for elevator work?  The project is scheduled to last 21 months. Elevators have no individually scheduled completion date.

4.	Will there be storage space provided in the building for light fixtures and other equipment?  Field office has not provided an answer as of yet. This question will be addressed in Amendment 3.

5.	Who is responsible for asbestos abatement?  The General Contractor will be responsible for all asbestos abatement. Areas where asbestos is present are noted in the technical specs.

6.	What work will need to be done after hours?  As of now, all work that needs to be done in tenant occupied space must be done after hours, as will most electrical work. Any work to be done in common areas will be done during off hours as necessary. Elevator phasing will be decided at a later date. We will attempt to be more specific in Amendment 3.

7.	Will the main freight elevator (#5) be worked on while the passenger elevator?s are being worked on?  No. Work on the main freight elevator will not commence until work on all passenger elevators is complete.

8.	Can we get our security clearances done early?  Fingerprint cards and the necessary forms can be picked up anytime, but we ask you to not turn anything in until after an award notification is made. 

9.	When can we anticipate an award?  We are anticipating an award in mid- February of 2003.

10.	 Offerors who meet the technical criteria of the RFP will be required to attend an interview to be held in Chicago on January 21 or January 22. Once the Source Selection Committee has made a decision on which offers are technically acceptable, letters will be sent to all offerors informing them of their status. Offerors who did meet the technical requirements will be given a date and time of when their interview will take place. Interview dates and times are non-negotiable. Failure to attend your interview will be deemed non-responsive and the offeror will be dropped from consideration.

 
11. It has become necessary to change certain sheets of the Technical Drawings. The sheets that are to be changed are noted on a separate spreadsheet included with this amendment. All sheets referred to in the column headed ?12/20/2002?  have been changed and will be on a compact disc to be sent with Amendment 3. There are 23 changes. 


Included in this package is a Past Performance Reference Information  Form. Photocopy this form and include one completed form for each project submitted in your bid package. Any information not included may result in a lower score. Please verify that all contact information is current and correct. Inability to contact a reference may result in a lower score.

<DESC>This notice seeks information on potential sources.  In addition to the technical challenges of this planned contract, proprietary data is involved for which the Government has only limited rights.  Interested and capable sources must provide complete responses to Sue Krauss, contract specialist, by e-mail not later than 07 January 2003 at Charlene.krauss@tinker.af.mil or by Facsimile to (405) 739-5451.  Interested sources must provide the following as a minimum response:  Details of the Contractor?s experience in support of Aircraft Mission Communications, evidence of ability to hangar aircraft identified in the description of effort, ISO 9002 compliance, and evidence of ability to obtain proprietary data from L-3 Communications.
	The Mission Communications System (MCS) Support contract will cover the VC-25A, C-20B, C-9A and C-9C Special Air Mission (SAM) aircraft.  The contract will include upgrade, spares, repair, on-site test bench support and operation, and field representative support.  The contract will also encompass a System Integration Lab (SIL) used for testing prior to integration of new systems to the MCS.  The MCS is a suite of airborne electronic equipment and systems.  It is composed of voice, data, facsimile, and encryption/decryption equipment interconnected with radio communications systems by a Communications Switching System (CSS). The switch is software and hardware driven.  The proprietary data for the switch is owned by L-3 Communications (previously E-Systems Inc.).  The Government has only limited rights in the data for the switching systems and therefore will not be able to provide the data to contractors.  While the MCS for each of the aircraft within the SAM fleet complies with the same general MCS description, each platform has a different specific combination of equipment to suit the mission.  
	The support being acquired will include program management, recurring and nonrecurring engineering efforts, minor system prototypes, minor modifications, upgrades and enhancements, drop-in, and kit purchases. \ See Note #22

<DESC>The Navy is seeking sources to manufacture Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA) batteries to replace the current flooded lead-acid batteries used in many of the Fleets submarines. It is the Navys intent to develop a Qualification Requirement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 9.2 for these items. Accordingly, we are currently conducting market research to determine current state-of-the-art and prospective manufacturers. Included in the market research are visits to known manufacturers facilities and some ongoing testing of VRLA cells. This testing may be applicable to the establishment of the aforementioned Qualification Requirement. The Navy typically spends roughly $10 - $15 million annually for flooded lead acid submarine batteries. Salient characteristics, physical dimensions and testing regimen are attached for reference. This notice is to invite intere sted parties to provide information and/or test samples to the Navy for evaluation. Test samples would be provided to the Government on a no-cost basis using a Bailment Agreement. Please submit, on or before 13 January 2003, company literature, resumes, references, and any other pertinent information for the Governments evaluation. Include business status (e.g., small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone, women-owned, etc.) and reference N00164-03-R-6918.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Joining Metals and Oxides without Brazing
<DESC>Joining Metals and Oxides without Brazing 

Basic research at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, has discovered a method to make strong interfaces between metals and oxides without the use of brazing. After appropriate oxide surface preparation, a surfactant exists at sub-monolayer coverage. These entities serve as anchors for metal atoms. The method was demonstrated experimentally for copper on alpha-alumina, but has also been understood using first principles calculations. The latter predict it will work well with most metals. It is a vacuum technique to maintain surface cleanliness. The metal can be laid slowly, such as by sputter deposition, or rapidly, such as by diffusion bonding under pressure.

Sandia (www.sandia.gov) is seeking partners to further develop and apply this technology.  For many of the potential applications, we expect our partners may need to fund additional
development work at Sandia.  For further information please respond by mail or fax to Alane Dulski within 2 weeks at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O.

<SUBJECT>99 -- A Room-Temperature Methaod to Form Strong and Thin Metal/Oxide Interfaces
<DESC>A Room-Temperature Method to Form Strong and Thin (~1 nm) Metal/Oxide Interfaces 

Basic research at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, has discovered a vacuum method to make strong interfaces between metals and oxides at room temperature. This method is ideal for microelectronics and thin film applications. After appropriate oxide surface preparation (it does not have ideal termination) and cleaning, metal is deposited. Cleaning may be done, for example, by an oxygen plasma.  Initially, metal deposition must be done using sputter or evaporation sources. A chemical reaction has been found that oxidizes about 1/10 monolayer of the initially arriving metal atoms. These are incorporated into the top layer of the oxide and serve as anchors for other metal atoms. Experimentally, the method was demonstrated for cobalt on alpha-alumina, but it has also been understood using first principles calculations. The latter predict it will work well with most metals, an exception being the noble metals. However, even these can be bound to a previous deposited more reactive metal. After he interface is formed, the metal can be laid rapidly.  Crystalline metal was found at only 4-6 monolayers, in spite of a substantial (~7%) lattice mismatch.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Stable Supported Catalysts with Maximal Dispersion
<DESC>Stable Supported Catalysts with Maximal Dispersion 

Basic research at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, has discovered a vacuum method to make stable supported catalysts with only 1-2 monolayers of reactive metal. Recent theoretical work by others suggests that these may be as reactive as supported nanocrystals of metal, and by achieving maximal dispersion cost is greatly reduced. Whether these catalysts may be used in specific applications depends on their stability at operating temperatures. However, the metal is pinned to the underlying oxide support by ionic anchors with coverages, depending on the method of manufacture, of from ~ 1/10 to ~ 1/3 monolayers. Since these are in turn bound ionically to the substrate, we expect good stability at elevated temperatures. The catalysts must be manufactured in vacuum conditions.

<SUBJECT>12 -- AN/GTV-1 SIMULATED LASER TARGET; NSN 1290-01-104-0251
<DESC>This is NOT a presolicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5, but is a Market Survey to identify sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience necessary to meet the Air Force requirements necessary to provide a functional replacement for the AN/GVT-1 Simulated Laser Target (SLT), NSN 1290-01-104-0251; P/N: 627224100.  The SLT is a portable, battery operated, eye safe, omni-directional, 1.06 micro-meter source of laser radiation.  This radiation source simulates ground laser designation of a tactical type target allowing pilots utilizing aircraft equipment with laser search/track sets to realistically perform operational training.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost incurred for their participation in this survey.  A Draft Requirements Description and a Contractor Capability Survey are available on the web.  The extent of foreign participation or level of security clearances required to receive a solicitation has not yet been determined.  Therefore, participation in this survey may not necessarily result in your company being able to participate in the solicitation.  Large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this survey.  Joint ventures or teaming arrangements may be advantageous.  Responses to this survey are due prior to close of business Friday, 24 Jan 2002.  If additional information is needed, contact Tom Robertson at 478-926-6726.

<SUBJECT>R -- Municipal Energy Efficiency Financing in Bulgaria
<DESC>The USAID Regional Contracting Officer in Budapest, Hungary, intends to award a sole-source contract for approximately one year beginning on or about March 15, 2003 at an estimated $350,000 to Harza Engineering Company Inc.  The contract will enable Harza to continue and expand their services in developing sustainable municipal energy efficiency financing in Bulgaria. 

The contract is being sole-sourced under AIDAR 706.302-70(b) for the continued provision of specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable delays.  In accordance with Numbered Note 22: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>--DISA industry Assured Service (MLPP) Profile for Voice over IP (VOIP).
<DESC>NA Defense Information System Agency (DISA) is working on  Voice Over IP (VOIP) standards that support DoD requirements.  The current focus of this effort is on H.323-based VOIP standards for Assured Connectivity. Assured Connectivity is a DoD requirement to enable mission critical users to complete VOIP calls in times of network congestion or failure. Multi-Level Precedence and Preemption (MLPP) is the solution for this requirement in circuit switched networks. This effort is in response to an urgent need to have interoperable VOIP systems within DoD. IP-based PBXs have been deployed in DoD,  and more deployments are expected. For interoperability and use of VOIP in DoD's command and control networks,  VOIP stand ards that support this requirement are needed. DISA is seeking industry participation in developing H.323 standards to support the Assured Connectivity requirement. We expect that this effort will be done mostly through emails and teleconferences, with minimal number of face-to-face meetings. Intereste d industry organizations should contact the DISA POC, Mr. Mike Morgan. This is not a procurement action.  This is a solicitation for no-cost, voluntary participation in development of the standard. Industry organizations participating in this effort will do so at their own expense. This announcement does not obligate DISA/IN/ IN31 or any other government organization to reimburse any participants' expenses.

(3) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items. This clause includes terms and conditions which are, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with customary commercial practices and is incorporated in the solicitation and contract by reference (see Block 27, SF 1449). The contracting officer may tailor this clause in accordance with 12.302. 
(4) The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. This clause incorporates by reference only those clauses required to implement provisions of law or executive orders applicable to the acquisition of commercial items. The contracting officer shall attach this clause to the solicitation and contract and, using the appropriate clause prescriptions, indicate which, if any, of the additional clauses cited in 52.212-5(b) or (c) are applicable to the specific acquisition. When cost information is obtained pursuant to Part 15 to establish the reasonableness of prices for commercial items, the contracting officer shall insert the clauses prescribed for this purpose in an addendum to the solicitation and contract. This clause may not be tailored. Use the clause with its Alternate I when the head of the agency has waived the examination of records by the Comptroller General in accordance with 25.1001. 
(c) When the use of evaluation factors is appropriate, the contracting officer may- 
(1) Insert the provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation- Commercial Items, in solicitations for commercial items (see 12.602); or 
(2) Include a similar provision containing all evaluation factors required by 13.106, Subpart 14.2 or Subpart 15.3, as an addendum (see 12.302(d)). 
(d) Use of required provisions and clauses. Notwithstanding prescriptions contained elsewhere in the FAR, when acquiring commercial items, contracting officers shall be required to use only those provisions and clauses prescribed in this part. The provisions and clauses prescribed in this part shall be revised, as necessary, to reflect the applicability of statutes and executive orders to the acquisition of commercial items. 
(e) Discretionary use of FAR provisions and clauses. The contracting officer may include in solicitations and contracts by addendum other FAR provisions and clauses when their use is consistent with the limitations contained in 12.302. For example: 
(1) The contracting officer may include appropriate clauses when an indefinite-delivery type of contract will be used. The clauses prescribed at 16.506 may be used for this purpose. 
(2) The contracting officer may include appropriate provisions and clauses when the use of options is in the Government's interest. The provisions and clauses prescribed in 17.208 may be used for this purpose. If the provision at 52.212-2 is used, paragraph (b) provides for the evaluation of options. 
(3) The contracting officer may use the provisions and clauses contained in Part 23 regarding the use of recovered material when appropriate for the item being acquired. 
(f) Agencies may supplement the provisions and clauses prescribed in this part (to require use of additional provisions and clauses) only as necessary to reflect agency unique statutes applicable to the acquisition of commercial items or as may be approved by the agency senior procurement executive, or the individual responsible for representing the agency on the FAR Council, without power of delegation.
