<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Womens Health (OWH) requires the professional services of a pediatrician and adolescent specialist to provide expertise and guidance in its mission to serve the interests of adolescent girls.  During the past decade there has been consistent presence of pediatric/adolescent expertise at OWH and at the end of September 2007 that presence will no longer be available.  The OWH plans negotiate on a sole source basis for these services with Jonelle Rowe, M.D., 1015 33rd Street, NW, Washington, DC 20007.  The period of performance is one year from date of award for 2 days a weeks, approximately 832 hours.  Specifically, the contractor shall (1) Work with OWH to develop an age appropriate strategic plan for implementation and roll out of bone health for its bone health effort; (2) Work with OWH communication division to review the ongoing content of the girls health website for medical accuracy and age appropriateness; (3) Work with OWH as it continues to implement the Body Works Obesity Prevention Program; particularly the Spanish version as well as work with the Indian Health Service on the implementation of the Native American version; (4) Assist OWH in developing the Anticipatory Guidance materials for Hispanic parent/families of adolescent girls, reviewing all materials for medical accuracy; (5) Work with OWH as it rolls out the soon to be completed Anticipatory Guidance materials for African American parents/families; (6) Provide adolescent expertise for other issues that arise as the OWH continues to work on girls health; and (7) Work with OWH on medical issues of maternal and child health, as needed.  This requirement will be awarded using FAR Subpart 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and shall not exceed the Simplified Acquisition threshold.  Dr. Rowe has been justified as a sole source in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) because she is uniquely qualified due to her past work as a pediatric expert in the Office on Womens Health for the past 10 years and has played a crucial part in the development and oversight of virtually all the programs on adolescent health in the office.  She had a leading role in the creation and on-going success of Body Wise, an eating disorder awareness campaign, the Body Works Toolkit, an obesity prevention program, the girls health website, the media literacy and youth development campaign and the anticipatory guidance program for parents of adolescent girls.  During the past year the OWH has taken over the Powerful Bones, Powerful Girls campaign from the CDC and Dr. Rowe has played a pivotal role in this process.  This position requires a state licensed, board certified pediatrician with significant experience in working at the Federal level developing public health programs dealing with adolescent girls health, specifically experience working on issues of eating disorders, body image, self esteem, obesity prevention, media literacy and youth development and counseling parents of adolescent girls.  Additionally knowledge of medical issues concerning maternal and infant health issues would be an asset.  The pediatrician must be able to interact effectively with members of the Society of Adolescent Medicine and other health professionals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and submit a capability statement addressing their experience in the field of adolescent girls issues, medical credentials and ability to provide the services set forth above.  There is no solicitation.  All responses must be e-mailed to msunday@psc.gov no later than 3:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time, September 24, 2008.  All submissions shall be reviewed by the Government and be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Womens Health (OWH) requires the professional services of a pediatrician and adolescent specialist to provide expertise and guidance in its mission to serve the interests of adolescent girls.  During the past decade there has been consistent presence of pediatric/adolescent expertise at OWH and at the end of September 2007 that presence will no longer be available.  The OWH plans to negotiate on a sole source basis for these services with Jonelle Rowe, M.D., 1015 33rd Street, NW, Washington, DC 20007.  The period of performance is one year from date of award for 2 days a weeks, approximately 832 hours.  Specifically, the contractor shall (1) Work with OWH to develop an age appropriate strategic plan for implementation and roll out of bone health for its bone health effort; (2) Work with OWH communication division to review the ongoing content of the girls health website for medical accuracy and age appropriateness; (3) Work with OWH as it continues to implement the Body Works Obesity Prevention Program; particularly the Spanish version as well as work with the Indian Health Service on the implementation of the Native American version; (4) Assist OWH in developing the Anticipatory Guidance materials for Hispanic parent/families of adolescent girls, reviewing all materials for medical accuracy; (5) Work with OWH as it rolls out the soon to be completed Anticipatory Guidance materials for African American parents/families; (6) Provide adolescent expertise for other issues that arise as the OWH continues to work on girls health; and (7) Work with OWH on medical issues of maternal and child health, as needed.  This requirement will be awarded using FAR Subpart 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and shall not exceed the Simplified Acquisition threshold.  Dr. Rowe has been justified as a sole source in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) because she is uniquely qualified due to her past work as a pediatric expert in the Office on Womens Health for the past 10 years and has played a crucial part in the development and oversight of virtually all the programs on adolescent health in the office.  She had a leading role in the creation and on-going success of Body Wise, an eating disorder awareness campaign, the Body Works Toolkit, an obesity prevention program, the girls health website, the media literacy and youth development campaign and the anticipatory guidance program for parents of adolescent girls.  During the past year the OWH has taken over the Powerful Bones, Powerful Girls campaign from the CDC and Dr. Rowe has played a pivotal role in this process.  This position requires a state licensed, board certified pediatrician with significant experience in working at the Federal level developing public health programs dealing with adolescent girls health, specifically experience working on issues of eating disorders, body image, self esteem, obesity prevention, media literacy and youth development and counseling parents of adolescent girls.  Additionally knowledge of medical issues concerning maternal and infant health issues would be an asset.  The pediatrician must be able to interact effectively with members of the Society of Adolescent Medicine and other health professionals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and submit a capability statement addressing their experience in the field of adolescent girls issues, medical credentials and ability to provide the services set forth above.  There is no solicitation.  All responses must be e-mailed to msunday@psc.gov no later than 3:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time, September 25, 2008.  All submissions shall be reviewed by the Government and be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

FAR Part 13 applies to this acquisition; however, FAR Part 13.5 does not apply as the estimated dollar value of this acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to continued need to match existing products for on-going research being conducted by the CDC.The requirement continues previous work and as such the government requires product consistency.  Offerors interested in this requirement shall submit a written response to the contracting officer that demonstrates their qualifications, to provide the samples as listed in the Statement of Work.  Responses must be received not later than 4:30pm ET, by the posted response due date.

<SUBJECT>B -- CDC Trauma Center National Sample Project, Phase IV - American College of Surgeons
<DESC>00HCTCE3-2007-45086  This is a notice of intent for a sole-source (i.e. non-competitive) acquisition.  Accordingly, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to purchase services as documented in the attached Statement of Work, from the American College of Surgeons Inc., 633 N. Saint Clair Street, Chicago, IL 60611.  This notice is not a solicitation and thus formal proposals or quotes are neither required nor requested.  
The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b).  FAR Part 13 applies to this acquisition; however, FAR Part 13.5 does not apply as the estimated dollar value of this acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The government intends to solicit this requirement from the American College of Surgeons Inc (ACS) because it is believed to be the only organization that meets the following criteria:
 a. A national organization that has as part of its charge to improve all phases of the management of the injured patient including prehospital care and transportation, hospital care, and rehabilitation; to prevent injuries in the home, in industry, on the highway, and during participation in sports; to establish and implement institutional and systems standards for care of the injured; to provide education to improve trauma care; and to cooperate with other national organizations with similar objectives.
b. A national organization that currently collects national trauma registry data from more than 200 U.S trauma centers. 
The ACS is further considered based on rights in data and applicable copy write laws, as the ACS National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) is the sole property of ACS, and will be utilized extensively throughout the project. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to continued need to match existing products for on-going research being conducted by the CDC.The requirement continues previous work and as such the government requires product consistency (e.g. presentation, content, style etc.).  Offerors interested in this requirement shall submit a written response to the contracting officer that demonstrates their qualifications, skills, and experience as identified above.  Responses must be received not later than 4:30pm ET, by the posted response due date.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this acquisition on a competitive basis.  A determination by the government not to compete this acquisition on a full and open competitive basis, based upon the responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Respondents assume all financial costs for responding to this notice and the government assumes no such financial obligation.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Title of Project:  Use of state laws to permit adolescent consent to hepatitis B, HPV, and other vaccinations

C.1  Background and Need 
A new vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV) has recently been licensed.  HPV is sexually transmitted, and the vaccine may be able to reduce 70% of cervical cancer and 90% of genital warts in the U.S.  Use of this vaccine is routinely recommended for 11-12 year old females, and catch-up vaccination is recommended for girls and women ages 13-26.  It is also recommended that adolescents receive Hepatitis B vaccination (unless they have already been vaccinated at a younger age).  Adolescents may request and consent for STD care themselves in all U.S. states.  However, vaccinating adolescents under age 18 without parental notification and consent is more complicated.  In several states, STD laws have been used to enable self-consent to hepatitis B vaccination, utilizing a broad interpretation of STD treatment which includes prevention of sexually transmissible vaccine-preventable diseases.  All states have laws allowing consent for medical care by selected subgroups of minors, and a single state has a law specifically enabling minors to consent to hepatitis B vaccination.  The current use of state laws and their interpretation for vaccinating adolescents for these sexually transmitted infections is not well known.  Most providers do not understand the current legal situation regarding adolescents? ability to self-consent for vaccination, and are uncertain about what to do if an adolescent requests one of these vaccines.  There is no document that describes current laws in all 50 states and program areas that providers can refer to when trying to decide about the legality of adolescent self-consent for vaccination.  This project would compile information into one document that providers could use for informed decision-making.

C.2  Project Objective 
To compile and publish the language and interpretation of laws in the U.S. that govern consent for health care for minors, including of state minor consent laws and current use of these laws to enable adolescent to give their own consent for HPV, hepatitis B, and other vaccinations.  This project would have implications beyond hepatitis B and HPV prevention to other vaccines currently in development.  

C.3  Scope of Work 
1. The contractor will perform searches of state and local laws to identify laws concerning minors to consent to health care and prevention services in the STD and Immunization program areas in the 50 U.S. states; 2. The contractor will perform a survey among local and state experts in these laws to determine current and potential use of these laws to enable self-consent for adolescent vaccination; and 3. using this survey, the contractor will assess the generalizability of these laws and identify other strategies that enable minor self-consent to vaccination.  

C.4  Technical Requirements 
 The contractor will collect laws that allow minors to give their own consent for health care by updating laws identified in an existing summary document (A English, KE Kenney. State Minor Consent Laws: A Summary. Center for Adolescent Health & the Law, May 2003).  All laws specifically regarding minor consent for vaccination, and those relating to consent by a minor based on their status (e.g., as mature, emancipated, homeless  minors, etc.) or based on the services they seek (e.g., for STDs and other reportable diseases) will be targeted in the search.

The contractor, after collecting the relevant laws, will analyze the laws to determine how they could be used to enable minors to consent to vaccination.  In consultation with the CDC Project Officer, a further assessment of how they have been used will be done through surveys of key players in states and localities.  The contractor will perform a survey of key players in states and localities.  The contractor, in consultation with the CDC Project Officer, will develop an initial survey which will be piloted in 7 cities or states.  The survey pilot will enable refinement of the survey instrument, and also enable targeting the most useful informants within the state or locality.  Key players/survey recipients in this pilot phase will include a state health department legal counsel, a vaccination program manager, a STD program manager, and a health officer, as well as other officials recommended by the participants.  Information to be collected on surveys will include:  official?s knowledge of existence of laws, current use of laws to facilitate vaccination of minors, relevant legal challenges/court interpretations of laws regarding minor consent, including self-consent for vaccination, policies and procedures of relevant health care providers, and venues where vaccinations are offered to adolescents.  Modified final surveys will then be mailed to targeted officials in each of the 50 states and some municipal STD and immunization project areas.  Reminder postcards, telephone calls, faxes and emails will be used to ensure at least 70% survey participation.

The contractor will compile the relevant laws, their interpretation, and results from the survey to generate a report that will be published and made available to providers and other public health officials.



C.5  Reporting Schedule 
Report of laws found ? 6 months after contract funded.  Includes language and scope of law, intended population, and interpretations, if any.
Report of pilot key informant interviews prior to survey implementation ? 9 months after contract funded
Final report of mailed surveys ? 12 months after contract funded.


C.6  Special Considerations

C.7  Government Furnished Property
The project officer will review the final survey prior to mailing.

C.8  References
