<DESC><p>ANTICIPATED SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE:&nbsp;March 2010. The 55th Contracting Squadron will be conducting the solicitation and award of a cost plus award fee, non-personal services contract under full and open competition for Joint Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Management and Planning System (JSMPS)/Joint Integrated SATCOM Tool (JIST) Support. This is a follow-on contract to FA4600-05-F-0212. Performance will be for a five-year period. This will include a base period, four one-year option periods, and an additional option period.</p>
<p>Services required within the scope of this requirement include technical support; hardware and software installation and integration; database and software development; continued development and deployment of existing JSMPS/JIST tools and capabilities; continued updating and employment of key SATCOM management and planning data; data manipulation and presentation; testing, demonstration, and fielding of developed software systems; and requisite hardware and software sustainment and support activities. JSMPS/JIST will be matured into a fully net-centric, web-enabled database and application suite with a hardware, software, and support architecture to meet the needs of DoD SATCOM stakeholders. The resulting tools and capabilities will provide a robust and secure environment for collaborative Electro-magnetic and Radio Frequency Interference (EMI/RFI) detection, tracking, analysis and mitigation. To accomplish this, JSMPS/JIST would expand existing capabilities encompassing assignment and execution data for all remaining DOD SATCOM systems, acquire needed data from existing and programmed SATCOM system management and planning applications and databases, and make this data readily available as an integrated and user-defined operational picture. To support better Intelligence Community (IC) participation in EMI resolution, JSMPS would be deployed on the JWICS network enclave with a cross-domain solution allowing for near-real time data refreshing from the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) JSMPS/JIST. JSMPS will connect to existing databases to provide data and products for Telemetry Tracking &amp; Control (TT&amp;C) data for all space systems to effectively support EMI resolution. Finally, JSMPS/JIST shall be available and sustainable while data is appropriately protected and secure.</p>
<p>On-site work may be performed at either of the following Government installations:</p>
<p>USSTRATCOM<br />Building 500<br />Offutt AFB, NE 68113-6600</p>
<p>AFSPC <br />Buildings 1470 &amp; 1471 <br />Peterson AFB, CO 80914-3050</p>
<p>All contractor personnel working any direct tasking on the project shall hold a minimum current SECRET security clearance (an interim SECRET clearance is acceptable for newly assigned personnel whose final clearance is still being completed). To work on-site within USSTRATCOM/J661 or within the GSSC, contractor personnel shall have a minimum TOP SECRET clearance and be eligible for Special Compartmented Information (SCI) indoctrination.</p>
<p>The RFP and all associated documents, when issued, will be posted on the required government-wide point of entry. No solicitation is available at this time. Offerors are encouraged to subscribe/register for this solicitation number through http://www.fedbizops.gov to ensure they automatically receive all documents associated with the procurement in a timely manner. All associated documents will be released electronically. The NAICS code is 541512. Anticipated award date is Fall 2010.</p>
<p>Address questions via email to the contract specialist or contracting officer only. No discussions will be conducted telephonically.</p>

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to invite bids for the procurement and implementation of Broadcast, MRL, and Ship-shore (BRASS) in Poland.

NC3A is serving as the NATO procurement agency for this project, which is being funded within the framework of the Infrastructure Committee. NC3A has been authorized to use the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure. The successful bid pursuant to this IFB (Invitation for Bid) will be that bid which is compliant with the technical requirements and is the lowest price offered.

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-12930-BRASS-POL and all correspondence concerning this IFB should reference this number. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

The IFIB package will only contain NATO UNCLASSIFIED material.  

Contractor personnel will be called on to work at a NATO site in conjunction with the contract and such contractor personnel will be required to have security clearances to the level of NATO SECRET.

The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications needed for performance of the contract.

NC3A plans to place a single contract with one contractor. No partial bidding will be allowed.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for an ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States. 

U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.  The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:

- the title and/or solicitation number of the project
- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents

Upon approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.  A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.

Using the contact information indicated on the DOE, the NATO contracting agency will contact the firm directly when the IFB has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date to request a DOE (and, for U.S. facilities not yet approved for NATO ICB, to submit a completed NATO ICB application): 25 March 2010

<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska, intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price procurement to Lotek Wireless Inc.  The U.S. Fish & Wildlife, Region Seven (7), Alaska requires GPS 4400S radio collars and replacement battery pack.
Background:
There has been an ongoing wolf study for approximately 2 years.  The initial procurement of radio telemetry equipment was from Lotex Wireless.  Remotely downloading location data from the wolves requires using a control unit that communicates with the radio collars.  At the time of the initial procurement  the USFWS purchased a control unit from Lotex.
A cost savings to the Government would be to continue procuring Lotex Wireless collars and replacement batteries that work directly and are compatible with the Lotex control unit.  
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.  See numbered note 22.

(c) If the Contractor's applicable established price is increased after the contract date, the corresponding contract unit price shall be increased, upon the Contractor's written request to the Contracting Officer, by the same percentage that the established price is increased, and the contract shall be modified accordingly, subject to the following limitations:(1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this clause shall not exceed 50 percent of the original contract unit price.(2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective-- (i) On the effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if the Contracting Officer receives the Contractor's written request within 10 days thereafter; or (ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the Contracting Officer receives the request.(3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of the increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause.(4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies the increase in the applicable established price.(5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase.(d) During the time allowed for the cancellation provided for in subparagraph (c)(5) of this clause, and thereafter if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall continue deliveries according to the contract delivery schedule, and the Government shall pay for such deliveries at the contract unit price, increased to the extent provided by paragraph (c) of this clause.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc., of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for the acquisition of two NA-20-12 UHT IFL Haynes 230/Sodium-filled Heat Pipes to replace the pipes currently being used as part of a furnace system used by NISTs Physics Laboratory. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

The Optical Technology Divison of NISTs Physics Laboratory currently utilizes two Advanced Cooling Technologies heat pipes in the existing furnace system in its laboratory.  Replacing the existing ACT heat pipes with new ACT pipes of identical dimensions will facilitate the transition of the furnace to a safer operating functionality without having to completely redesign the furnace, which was originally designed around the ACT heat pipes currently in place.  Redesigning the furnace to accommodate heat pipes from another manufacturer would be cost prohibitive.

Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. is the only contractor who can provide the NA-20-12 UHT IFL Haynes 230/Sodium-filled Heat Pipes that meet NISTs requirements.  Therefore, Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the required NA-20-12 UHT IFL Haynes 230/Sodium-filled Heat Pipes.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on March 19, 2010.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>Support For Epidemiological Studies of Cancer Risk in U.S. Radiologic Technologists <br />RFP: NO2-CP-01003-50. The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) of the National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, proposes to enter into a sole source contract with the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455. This requirement will provide for a contract with a base period of one year, and four successive one year options for support services for etiologic cohort and case-control studies among 146,000 U.S. radiologic technologists to: (i) examine key etiologic factors for basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common cancer and one of the most costly to the U.S.; (ii) better understand the potentially protective relationship between ultraviolet radiation (UVR)/vitamin D and several specific cancers (e.g., colon, breast, and prostate cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma); (iii) investigate preliminary observations of increased risks of brain tumors and stroke in U.S. radiologic technologists performing or assisting with fluoroscopically-guided (FG) radiologic procedures, and breast cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in technologists performing or assisting with radioactive iodine therapy, and continue monitoring the cohort for cancer and other radiation-related diseases associated with protracted low-to-moderate-dose ionizing radiation (IR) exposure; and (iv) investigate the potential modification of radiation-related breast cancer risks by genetic variation.

<DESC>The US Government has a long history and extensive network of international collaboration and partnerships in the fight against HIV/AIDS, providing funding, technical assistance, and program support.  These collaborations increase the fundamental understanding of HIV transmission and provide an evaluative basis for prevention and intervention success.  The current HIV/AIDS epidemic is devastating.  Militaries, in particular, have been identified as a high-risk population.  In order to target this population, the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, California, under the oversight of the Navy Surgeon General, has been tasked to serve as the US Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for the DoD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP).
DHAPP has successfully engaged over 80 countries in efforts to combat HIV/AIDS among their respective military services.  DHAPP is a partner U. S. Government (USG) organization collaborating with the US State Department, Health and Human Services, US Agency for International Development, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  Working closely with US Department of Defense, US Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, university collaborators, and other nongovernmental organizations, DHAPP assists countries in establishing HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs and/or strengthening their capabilities to combat HIV.  
DHAPP's goal is to maximize program impact by focusing on the drivers of the epidemic specific to the military, and to support the development of interventions and programs that address these issues.  DHAPP works with countries' militaries to devise plans based on the following process:
.	Meet with key partners in country to determine provisional major program areas and other technical assistance needs. .	Adapt DHAPP support to a country's need for prevention, care and/or treatment of their HIV/AIDS situation based on an assessment of the country's epidemic, and more specifically, in that country's military. .	Strengthen the military capacity for ownership and behavioral changes over the long term. .	Consider program design by leveraging assets with other country partners who have/had successful prevention, care, and/or treatment efforts. .	Focus on prevention, care and/or treatment impact aligned with national implementation plans. .	Implement and monitor programs to ensure accountability and sustainability. 
Countries and their militaries need strong programs with courses of action that demonstrate: 
.	Visible support from the military sector. .	Development of plans of action and policies. .	Alignment with partner country USG funded strategies and priorities..	Increasing awareness within the military sector. .	Country military ownership of its activities. .	Prevention plans focusing on prevention of sexual transmission through voluntary counseling and testing, sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention and management, behavioral interventions, reduction of concurrent partnerships, prevention and care of opportunistic infections, male circumcision, changing male normative behaviors, and prevention campaigns. .	Reduction of mother-to-child transmission, (The primary focus of these interventions is on behavior change to reduce the risks of sexual transmission, counseling, testing, diagnosis and proper linkages to care and support)..	Stigma reduction associated with HIV infection. .	Surveillance and infrastructure development through programs focusing on HIV/STI/tuberculosis surveillance, prevalence surveys, laboratory support, monitoring and evaluation, training and strategic information management..	Increasing capacity building..	Promoting sustainability by the partner country.

<SOLNBR>10-100-SOL-00015
<CONTACT>Deborah M Patrick, Contracting Officer, Phone 202- 260-0689, Fax 202-205-4520, Email deborah.patrick@hhs.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND

The Emergency Care Coordination Center (ECCC) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) was created in response to Homeland Security Presidential Directive 21 in order to: (1) lead an enterprise to promote and fund research in emergency medicine and trauma health care, (2) promote regional partnerships and more effective emergency medical systems in order to enhance appropriate triage, distribution, and care of routine community patients, and (3) promote local, regional, and State emergency medical systems' preparedness for response to public health events.

The office, in coordination with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Service (FICEMS), addresses the full spectrum of issues that have impact on care in hospital emergency departments, encompassing the complete continuum of patient care from the pre-hospital environment to disposition from emergency or trauma care. The Office coordinates with existing executive departments and agencies that perform functions relating to emergency medical systems in order to ensure unified strategy,  policy and implementation.

The ECCC is guiding Federal efforts to implement the Institute of Medicine's (The Future of Emergency Care in the United States Health System) 2006 recommendation to develop regionalized, accountable systems of emergency care.   As initial steps in promoting the development of regionalized systems of care, the ECCC funded an Institute of Medicine workshop (Regionalizing Emergency Care) and sponsored a national stakeholders meeting (Regionalization Demonstration: Concepts and Critical Features Roundtable) which helped to identify major issues, trends and areas where additional information would be constructive. The ECCC's next logical step is to fund projects to acquire more detailed information, data and best practices about regionalization of emergency care in four (4) component areas. 

The information and best practices resulting from these four projects will: a) help to develop suggested potential national guidelines for regionalization of emergency care; b) be useful in developing requirements for potential regionalization demonstration projects, and c) be useful in providing Federal technical assistance and support in the development of regionalized emergency care systems.

OBJECTIVES

A solicitation will be issued, on or about March 17, 2010, to acquire detailed information and information analysis about regional emergency care system development, operation and maintenance for each of four (4) projects comprising a comparative effectiveness research (CER) analysis.  The program will result in separate contract awards for each major component area.  The results of these projects will be of value in  the development of a nation-wide system for regionalized emergency care delivery,  providing technical assistance and in developing guidelines for subsequent demonstration projects.

Each of these four projects will examine the evidence that supports best practices in regionalized care, provide information and lessons learned, and generate insights for systems of regionalized and accountable emergency care.   Each of the projects must also support these broad project goals:

1. To identify current and potential performance measurements that impact the regionalization of emergency care, both at the patient and system level.

2. To examine the value of regionalization from both a patient and a system perspective.

3. To identify significant advances in the field of knowledge regarding emergency care regionalization that can be translated into improved regionalization efforts and shared in appropriate peer-reviewed literature.

4. To provide specific direction for future regionalization of emergency care efforts.

SCOPE OF WORK

The title of each project component is set forth below.  The pending solicitation will contain more detailed information on the scope of work for each program area. Offerors will be expected to use the best science possible to achieve project purposes.   It is recognized that complete national assessments of regional care delivery systems is not feasible for each of these projects. Components A, B and C are intended to programmatically inform the development of Component D leading to a comprehensive comparative effectiveness evaluation of Regionalized Emergency Care Delivery:

Component A: Current Practices for Delivery of Regionalized Emergency Care in Time-Sensitive Clinical Conditions.

Component B: Regionalized Emergency Care Information Management

Component C: Patient Mobility

Component D: Comparative Effectiveness of Regionalized emergency Medical Care Models

The work plan and deliverables will be described in the solicitation.  Offerors will be required to submit proposals for a minimum of one and maximum of four components. However, each component will result in a separate contract award.

Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Construction Management (CM) Services.
The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for Construction Management (CM) services for the lease construction of Federal Bureau of Investigation office buildings in Indianapolis, Indiana and Detroit, Michigan.  This procurement falls under one solicitation with the possibility of multiple awards.  The estimated cost of the lease construction for the Indianapolis site is $30-40 million and the estimated cost of the lease construction for the Detroit site is $70-80 million.  The Construction Manager (CM) shall be a member of the project development team during planning/design and construction phases.  It is anticipated that design for both projects will begin in February of 2007.

The scope of the CM services under this proposed contract includes pre-planning, programming, design management, monitoring LEED certification, design review, procurement support, construction management, commissioning, and post-construction support in cooperation with GSA personnel, building clients, A/E firms, and construction contractors.  

The CM does not perform design or actual construction work.  All contracts for design and construction will be conducted directly with GSA.  All work will be performed under a firm, fixed-price contract.  The fixed price shall include the cost for all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided).  

The CM shall plan, schedule, coordinate, and assure effective performance of all services.

This will be a firm, fixed-price contract. 

Small Business Participation: This is a negotiated procurement open to both large and small business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size standard of $31 million. Although this procurement is not set aside for small businesses, small businesses including women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, small disadvantaged businesses and service disabled veteran-owned businesses are strongly encouraged to participate in this project. In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract. Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA). An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract. Small businesses are not subject to this requirement. However, all firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local business participation. In order to receive the benefit of a price evaluation preference as a HUBZone small business concern, firms must be certified by the SBA. Please refer to the SBA website at www.sba.gov for details.

Joint Ventures: Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality CM team effort.

<DESC>Synopsis:The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Acquisition and Logistics, Technology Acquisition Center is looking for sources that are able to implement an interface to the "new" VistA Cache that accesses VA records in real time in support of the VHA Innovations program. This effort will include the design, development, and implementation of a Natural Language Processing (NLP)/ -Concept Based Indexing (CBI) interface with VistA Cache to obtain VA records and feedback information. These records will be parsed using a proven natural language processing concept based indexing (NLP/CBI) system to extract and codify text information using vetted medical terminology such as Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine SNOMED. The proposed solution is to build an interface to the VistA Cache and the NLP/CBI application that enables ontology driven rules using the NLP derived clinical data to message clinicians. The proof-of-concept is an informatics NLP/CBI application prototype that shall interface with the VA VistA system to query and input target clinical narrative source documents into the NLP/CBI parser. The NLP/CBI application (front-end tool) shall parse and index the clinical text entries and create output in nearly real-time. The output shall comprise a marked-up document whose view shows identified concepts, a data table(s) of codified ontology concepts, keywords, and respective document identification, word/phase/sentence/section location, and meta data. The prototype knowledge engineering shall demonstrate post-coordination use of compositional expressions in a use case with a processed message to the clinician provider. The contractor will integrate a knowledge extraction module (back-end tool) that allows users to design their own clinical algorithms with existing capacity to run them on the NLP/CBI output. The prototype shall be developed and tested in the OI innovation "sandbox" development environment. The contractor shall provide hardware and software support during one year prototype phase. It is anticipated the VA will award a twelve-month Firm-Fixed-Price contract for this effort. The NAICS Code 541511Contracting Office Address: Department of Veterans Affairs; Technology Acquisition Center; 260 Industrial Way West; Eatontown NJ 07724 Point of Contact(s): Kristine H.

<RESPDATE>031810

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
<p>Title of Project: Retrospective collection of child protective service reports among National Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project.</p>
<p>Introduction: This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement." The proposed NAICS code for this requirement is 541720.</p>
<p>Background: Early Head Start was initiated in response to the 1994 Head Start reauthorization. This comprehensive, two-generation program includes intensive services that begin before the child is born and concentrate on enhancing the child's development and supporting the family during the critical first three years of life. In the authorizing legislation, Congress mandated a rigorous evaluation of the new initiative.</p>
<p>To evaluate the impact of EHS, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) has been conducting an ongoing large-scale (3001 families), multisite (17 sites across the US ), and randomized controlled trial (National Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project). Children and families were randomly assigned to the Early Head Start program and a control group at the time they applied for program services. Children and families were followed while in the program and follow-ups were conducted in the spring prior to children's entry into Kindergarten and again in fifth grade. Findings from this trial consistently show more positive outcomes for intervention children and their parents as compared to controls that include higher mental and language development scores; a more stimulating home environment for EHS children; more emotionally supportive parenting and a reduction in spanking among EHS parents. These data suggest that the intervention has contributed to more nurturing relationships for children but there have been no assessments of actual child maltreatment collected at any time during this study.</p>
<p>EHS offers children and family's comprehensive child development services through center-based, home-based, and a mixed program options. Although there is evidence that home-based services to parents beginning prenatally and continuing through the first two years can impact parenting and child maltreatment rates, we lack evidence of the impact of mixed home visits and center- or center-based child care with parental involvement such as that provided by some of the EHS programs. In addition to promoting nurturing relationships, mixed home-center or center-based child care might influence the occurrence of child maltreatment directly, and they might moderate or mediate individual- and family-level risk or protective factors.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: This research contract is to collect retrospective data on family involvement with the child welfare system for five sites (n=750) and to use these data to answer the following questions:<br />&bull; How many parents in the sample have been involved in the child welfare system (report, substantiated report, out-of-home placement)?<br />&bull; Does the percentage of parents involved in the child welfare system significantly differ between EHS participants and the control sample?<br />&bull; Was EHS involved in the reporting (potential surveillance bias)?<br />&bull; How does this link with other risk data? (i.e., family demographic risks, family conflict, discipline, social networks, observed parenting behaviors)? <br />&bull; What are the factors that increase or decrease these children's risk of maltreatment, and to what extent does EHS play a role in buffering these risks?</p>
<p>Project Requirements: The project will require:<br />- Number and rate of parental involvement in the child welfare system (substantiated reports and out-of-home placements) for the five National Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project sites sample and by intervention group; <br />- Proportional likelihood (or other measure of association) of involvement in the child welfare system by intervention group, adjusted for family demographic risks and family conflict; <br />- Risk ratios for associations between family demographic risks, family conflict, discipline, social networks, observed parenting behaviors and involvement in the child welfare system;</p>
<p>Throughout this entire contract period CDC will provide input on the implementation of the study protocol. The contractor shall work collaboratively with CDC and be responsible for documenting progress during each phase of the contract. CDC will be intricately involved in all phases of this project and will provide leadership or collaborative input as coauthors on all presentations, publications, or manuscripts that result from this contract.</p>
<p>Contractor should be affiliated with the National Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project; and present evidence of access to relevant child protective services databases that include reports from1996 to present.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance: The period of performance shall be 24 months from the contract award date.<br />Capability statement /information sought. Please explain, in detail, your experience, knowledge and ability to provide the following:<br />Your opinion about the difficulty and or feasibility of the potential requirement or proposed acquisition, possible solutions and approaches that may currently exist in the marketplace, and information regarding innovative ideas or concepts.</p>

Your completed projects of similar nature. Your corporate experience and management capability. Provide any examples of prior completed Government contracts, reference, and other related information.</p>

<SUBJECT>Sustainable Aspects of Asphalt and Concrete Pavements in the Design, Construction, Repair, and Rehabilitation of Highway Pavements
<SOLNBR>DTFH61-10-R-00017
<RESPDATE>031810
<CONTACT>Daniel Confer, Email daniel.confer@dot.gov
<DESC>Potential Sources Sought. This is not a RFP.
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for an anticipated contract to advance the knowledge of sustainable aspects of asphalt and concrete pavements and the use of life cycle assessment as a tool in the design, construction, repair and rehabilitation of highway pavements. A strategic outcome of this effort will be to increase the body of knowledge regarding sustainability aspects of asphalt and concrete materials in pavement design and construction and to increase the use of sustainable technologies and practices. The effort will consist of four distinct yet related parts:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Part A:</strong> Evaluate available tools that utilize the life cycle assessment framework, which could be used for assessing the "carbon footprint" of highway pavements. Such tools should demonstrate the effect of various pavement design parameters on the environmental performance of a given pavement throughout its service life. Following pavement type selection, for asphalt and concrete pavements, a desirable assessment tool would provide feedback concerning the incorporation of design features that would affect not only the load-carrying ability, durability characteristics, and service life of the pavement; but also, its carbon footprint. The product of this effort would be a report describing and evaluating available tools which could be used, or adapted for use, to assess the carbon footprint of pavements.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Part B:</strong> Establish a technical working group (TWG), which will provide technical input to FHWA on sustainability and environmental issues pertaining to the design, construction, repair and rehabilitation of highway pavements. The TWG will include stakeholders from FHWA, other Federal agencies (EPA, etc.), academia, industry, and state departments of transportation.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Part C: </strong>Develop guidance documents discussing sustainable practices for the design, construction, repair and rehabilitation of highway pavements. Documents may include reports, manuals, and/or handbooks for the implementation of such practices.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Part D:</strong> Evaluate existing tools that may be used for assessing the sustainability of highway pavements. Factors included in the assessment should include, but not be limited to, construction materials as well as design and construction practices. The FHWA Office of Pavement Technology has ongoing programs to develop and transfer new technologies related to improved pavement performance. The products resulting from this effort will be incorporated into those programs for demonstration and implementation.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Offerors will be expected to have capabilities in:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span>&bull;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Technical and engineering - pavements - Capabilities to fully understand the technical aspects of highway pavement systems and to convey that knowledge to other parties including but not limited to engineers, contractors and agency/owners of roadways.</p>

Other capabilities that would be considered useful include editorial and document production services.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span>&bull;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Project management and reporting - Capabilities to perform and/or direct the efforts of technical, engineering, communications, and marketing staff.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Timely and cost-effective performance in each of the 4 areas above is required.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The estimated period of performance for the project is five years.&nbsp; The level of activity&nbsp;and staffing requirements for this project&nbsp;will&nbsp;depend&nbsp;on the funding provided under current and future transportation legislation. Potential staffing may include the following: project manager, principal investigator, senior engineer, technology deployment specialist, economist, technical assistant, meeting facilitator, and administrative assistant.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE: Any interested organizations are invited to submit a Capability Statement by e-mail to daniel.confer@dot.gov no later than 3:00pm local time on March 18, 2010.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS CONTEMPLATED PROCUREMENT IS ANTICIPATED TO UTILIZE THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) OF 2009 FUNDING IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT RESPONSIBLE SOURCES CAN SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT.

All responsible sources are encouraged to respond to this notice; however, sources that do not respond shall not be precluded from responding to any subsequent solicitation.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks a High Frame Rate Neutron Imaging Detector to extend the temporal resolution of neutron radiography to study two phase flow phenomena, where the two phases are vapor and liquid.  In these experiments, there is a high contrast between the phases, enabling the velocity of the phases to be accurately measured.  Due to the high speed, it is necessary to couple the camera with the scintillator to reduce light loss, and to amplify the light signal above the electronic noise in the camera.  A large camera resolution (large pixel array) is required to have a spatial resolution of 0.3 mm or less over the required field of view.

Responses from responsible sources should clearly establish capability of providing High Frame Rate Neutron Imaging Detectors.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the Detector, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. 

If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that result would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

Requirements for the High Frame Rate Neutron Imaging Detector are as follows:

1.	Detector image spatial resolution about 0.3 mm or better;
2.	A large field of view in the range of 10 cm by 10 cm to 25 cm by 25 cm, with a preference for the larger field of view, which can be achieved with a large format detector or a scintillator with a fiber optic taper;
3.	A high frame rate, greater than 100 Hz;
4.	A thermal neutron (neutron energy of 25 meV) detection efficiency of about 15% or greater;
5.	If an event counting detector, the dead-time should be minimized and capable of handling an event fluence rate of 5 x 107 cm-2 s-1
6.	If a scintillator with a CCD or CMOS camera, a means to amplify the low, per-frame photon count rate above the noise;
7.	Non-radiation hard components should be protected from radiation damage.

Requested Information to be Included in Responses to this Notice: 

1.  Indicate whether your company manufactures or is an authorized reseller/business partner for a Neutron Imaging Detector of any kind and, if so, please provide complete commercial specifications for the Neutron Imaging Detector(s) that your company manufactures or sells, including the name of the company that manufactures the Neutron Imaging Detector(s), where it is manufactured, and detailed functional and performance specifications that the product meets.

2.  If your organization is an original equipment manufacturer of Neutron Imaging Detectors, then please provide the name of company(ies) that are authorized by your organization, as the OEM, to sell your organization's Neutron Imaging Detector(s), as well as their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).

3.  Indicate the number of days, after acceptance of order, which is typical for delivery of Neutron Imaging Detectors to the intended delivery location.

4.  A complete copy of standard terms and conditions for the Neutron Imaging Detector(s) that your organization manufactures or sells, to include, at a minimum: base warranty, available extended warranty (if offered), copy of software license(s) (if applicable), and customary payment terms.

<DESC>This project is an American Recovery and Reinvestment (ARRA) action.  Receipt of award is contingent upon the offeror's meeting the requirements of Section 1512 (reports on use of funds) of the Recovery Act.
CORRECTION OF NAICS:  This sources sought notice is issued to correct the NAICS that was issued under a previous one, which was 238190. NAICS 238190 was incorrect and this sources sought notice is being issued under NAICS 562910. The reason for the change is that the industry for NAICS 562910 comprises establishments primarily engaged in one or more of the following: (1) remediation and cleanup of contaminated buildings, mine sites, soil, or ground water; (2) integrated mine reclamation activities, including demolition, soil remediation, waste water treatment, hazardous material removal, contouring land, and revegetation; and (3) asbestos, lead paint, and other toxic material abatement. 
The NAICS code 238190 industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in building foundation and structure trades work (except poured concrete, structural steel, precast concrete, framing, masonry, glass, and glazing, roofing, and siding). The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, maintenance, and repairs. This industry for NAICS 238190 does not efficiently facilitate the performance of the required task, as shown below under "description", especially the reclamation aspects of the description.
Cleanup of mine sites and mine reclamation activities are marked by qualities or characteristics or equipment that facilitate the performance of the required task, as described below under "description", in the best possible manner. The government's technical and contracting personnel believe that NAICS 562910 industry is more efficient to perform the task than under NAICS 238190. This is especially so when considering the reclamation part of the description of work to be performed. 
GENERAL: The National Park Service (NPS), Department of Interior is seeking responses of interest from contractors with capability and interest in a project described below.

Requirement

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Whiteville, NC that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 403 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 366 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for a base period of two (2) years firm term with one (1) one-year option period with 120 days termination notice.  The space must be available for occupancy by 09/01/2010.  The delineated area is the entire city limits of Whiteville, including:

NORTH:  East from the intersection of Union Valley Rd. and Golf Course Lake Rd. to NC 1700/Red Hill Rd.

EAST:  On a line South from the intersection Golf Course Lake Rd. and NC 1700/Red Hill Rd. to Main St.

SOUTH: On a line West from the intersection of NC 1700/Red Hill Rd. and Main St. to Union Valley Rd.

WEST: On a line North from the intersection of Main St. and Union Valley Rd. to Golf Course Lake Rd.

Other applicable requirements include:
 Parking for 2 Government vehicles, 2 employee vehicles, and 6 client parking spaces (total of 10 parking spaces).

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency down-time.

<DESC>GOVERNMENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV), Indian Head, Maryland is requesting information on commercially available autonomous mission planner software modules that perform mission goal-oriented, dynamic, automated re-planning of single and multiple Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) behaviors.  Submissions must reflect systems designs that are interoperable with REMUS-based mission planners and the Common Operator Interface Navy (COIN) for tactical mission planning of MK 18 UUV systems.  The module must be capable of integrating automatic target recognition (ATR) capabilities to provide single or multiple UUVs operating cooperatively to use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sensor inputs from UUVs to aid in decision making and dynamic mission, automated re-planning to improve overall mission efficiency and effectiveness.  The module must also provide sufficient machine intelligence so as to relieve operators of the burden of scripting missions in the pre-mission planning mode, thereby reducing operator error and improving overall system reliability. Performance description information is sought in the form of brochures, specifications sheets, and company points of contact. Any information available on demonstrated or expected performance and estimated unit cost is also desired. Also of interest are systems which are currently in advanced stages of development which are planned to become commercially available in the 2011 time frame. Please note the expected availability date on these submissions. Design proposals requiring developmental funding are not of interest at this time. Deadline for submission is 28 March 2010.  Questions regarding this solicitation may be directed to the above POC.

<DESC>The Coast Guard is seeking contractors interested in submitting proposals for providing propane to remote NDS radio sites located at the following locations: Juneau: Duke Island, Sukkwan Island, Cape Fanshaw, Zarembo Island, Mt. MacArthur, Robert Barron, Althorp Peak, Kodiak: Bede Mountain, Raspberry Island, Cape Gull, Sitkinak Dome, Marmot Island, Rugged Island, Valdez: Naked Island, Point Pigot and Tuklung. The NDS Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter. There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season. Typical transportation of propane to these sites will include the use of a barge and/or helicopter. The full "pickle barrels" are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the remote site by a helicopter rated for that load. A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane from the 125 gallon "pickle barrels" to standard 500 gallon propane tanks. This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity. Contractor shall perform propane leak checks (soap spray or sniffer) on all propane tanks and fuel lines at NDS remote sites, up to the location where fuel line enters generator hut.

<DESC>55 CONS/LGCZ, Offutt AFB, NE intends to award a one month sole source extension to BAE Systems National Security Solutions under authority of 40 U.S.C. 121(c), FAR 8.405-6 and DFARS 208.405-70. The specific circumstance that justifies restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(b)(2). The continued work is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule order and was competed and awarded in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not issued under sole source or limited source procedures. The contractor shall continue to provide Computer Network Operations Support for USSTRATCOM / J2. The primary objective of this task order is the continued support of USSTRATCOM and DoD-wide IO/CNO intelligence operations missions executed from USSTARTCOM J2 at Offutt Air Force Base, NE. This task order provides Advisory and Assistance (A&amp;AS) support for CNO Intelligence analysis, technical assistance, linguistic/cultural skills, and production and dissemination support of intelligence. This end-to-end support includes all aspects of the USSTRATCOM IO mission. A Top Secret clearance with eligibility for Special Compartment Information (SCI), Nuclear Command and Control (NC2), and Crypto access is required for contractor personnel required to perform their duties in an SCI facility.
<p>The follow-on effort's source selection will not be completed by 31 Mar 10, the end date of the current period of performance. Therefore, the Government intends to extend the current task order for one month (1 Apr 10 through 30 Apr 10) to allow time for completion of the follow-on source selection.</p>
<p>This notice is neither a request for a competitive proposal nor a solicitation for offerors. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement is based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>If your company has the capability to provide CNO Support services at full performance starting 1 Apr 10 through 30 Apr 10 (1 month), provide a capability package to the Contracting Officer and a copy to the Contract Specialist by the response date, 11 Mar 10.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, AND IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA), PUBLIC LAW 111-5.
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) posted a sources sought notice on November 19, 2009 for Solicitation No. SB1341-10-RP-0012, to identify potential sources that could satisfy the requirements as described in that sources sought notice. NIST evaluated all responses. One company responding to the sources sought notice was a Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). In an effort to determine if a SDVOSB set-aside would be appropriate, NIST conducted a Dynamic Small Business search of SDVOSB companies by NAICS code. All identified companies were contacted to determine if they were interested in this requirement. By the established due date, no responses were received.</p>
<p>As a result of NIST's evaluation of responses to the sources sought notice, and the additional market research done by specific outreach, NIST identified only one well-qualified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) that can perform the requirements set forth in that sources sought notice. Therefore, pursuant to the authority set forth under the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. 567f), NIST intends to negotiate and award a sole source labor-hour type contract with Coley and Associates, Inc., San Antonio, TX, which is a SDVOSB. In accordance with FAR 16.602, a labor hour type contract has been determined as the most suitable vehicle for this requirement due to the uncertainties involved with contract performance, and the fact that is not possible to accurately estimate the extent of Contractor effort to complete all of the assigned tasks under the contract.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Park Service (NPS), Intermountain Region (IMR), intends to award a project for the design, production and installation of wayfinding, sloper, and trailhead signage at Colorado Chautauqua National Historic Landmark (NHL), Boulder, CO.  The project is being awarded in accordance with all requirements of the Challenge Cost Share program (CCSP), which is a program to increase participation by qualified partners in the preservation and improvement of NPS natural, cultural, and recreational resources in all authorized service programs and activities, both outside or inside park lands, and on national trails as defined under the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. 1241-51).  The NPS and partners work together on CCSP projects with mutually beneficial, shared outcomes.  The CCSP is a matching fund program. An equal amount of eligible and matching share of funds, goods, or services from non-federal sources is required. Currently, the maximum CCSP award is $30,000. Projects selected generally are able to be completed within one year.
Operating under the authority of the 1935 Historic Sites Act (16 U.S.C. 461-67) and the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.), the NPS administers the National Historic Landmark (NHL) Program, which provides for the identification, documentation, preservation, and interpretation of the nation's nationally significant historic buildings, sites, objects, structures, and districts.  The NPS seeks to preserve the San Miguel Chapel, a contributing building within the Barrio de Analco NHL district. 
This project includes design, production and installation of 1) wayfinding signage; 2) two free-standing sloper signs; and 3) trailhead signage; as well as 4) the research, writing, professional recording, and locator signs for a self-guided audio tour throughout the Colorado Chautauqua National Historic Landmark (NHL).  The project is collaboration among the CCA, the City of Boulder's departments of Parks and Recreation, Open Space and Mountain parks, and their advisory bodies, and the NPS.  Partial funding for this project is being provided through the Challenge Cost Share Program (CCSP.)
The sole source justification for this award shall be provided upon request.  If you have specific questions, or require clarification of this notice, please contact Kelvin Smalls, Contract Specialist, at (505) 988-6083, or I may be reached by e-mail at kelvin_smalls@nps.gov.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO BE AWARDED TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT HOLDER. REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED
<p>The purpose of Task Order (TO) #174 is to obligate $234,221.00 in support of the Missouri State Penitentiary site located in&nbsp;Jefferson City, Missouri requiring a Targeted Brownfield Assessment (TBA). The period of performance will be from March 4, 2010 through December 17, 2010. Requirements for Task Order #174 include the following:<br /><br />The contractor shall perform Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessments (ESA). The purpose of Phase I is to identify recognized environmental conditions in connection with the property through the following: records review, site reconnaissance, interviews and reports. The objective of Phase II is to evaluate the conditions identified in Phase I utilizing the following components: developing the scope of work, assessment activities, evaluation and presentation of data, and presentation of findings and conclusions.<br /><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency' s START contracts were awarded as ID/IQ contracts, they were awarded competitively with fixed rates, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing START contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing START contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.5 to Zara Environmental, LLC. 1707 W. FM 1626 Manchaca, Texas 78652. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Zara Environmental, LLC is the only known source capable of meeting the Government's requirements due to the unique capability to provide support and service for this product.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later 11:00 am CST on 9 Mar 2010.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this note.  No RFP will be issued based upon the Notice of Intent.  Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to Brittney.l.white@usace.army.mil with the solicitation number referenced in the subject line.<BR><BR>Requirements are as follows:<BR><BR>A minimum 0f 40 C. secretus crickets be collected from each of a minimum of 30 caves on Fort Hood. The Environmental Genetics & Genomics Team (EGGT) and its academic collaborators will provide personnel to lead the sample collection effort and the contract awardee will provide to field personnel to assist in collection. Because the locations of caves on the installation are often difficult to locate and access, and can present physically caves on the installation are often difficult o locate and access, and can prevent physically challenging and potentially hazardous field conditions, personnel provided by the contract awardee must include at least one field assistant highly familiar with caves on fort hood. Likewise field personnel should be well trained and experienced in caving techniques. Because C secretus cricket population numbers in caves can be highly variable, because cricket species in caves can be cryptic, and because several karst species are sensitive and must be treated appropriately, the contract awardee will provide at least one field assistant with proven familiarity and experience with C secretus crickets and other Fort Hood karst fauna. Finally, the contract awardee must hold appropriate USFWS permits for surveying karst fauna.<BR>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for this requirement; as a result proposals are being requested. A DD Form 254 will be issued to the successful offeror with contract award.</p>
<p>The U.S. Air Force's Air Combat Command, with headquarters at Langley AFB, VA is the primary provider of air combat forces to America's Unified Combatant Commands. ACC operates fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, battle-management, rescue and theater airlift aircraft, as well as command, control, communications and intelligence systems. ACC provides forces for the five geographical, unified commands - U.S. Central Command, U.S. Southern Command, U.S. European Command, U.S. Pacific Command, and U.S. Northern Command including air defense forces for the North American Aerospace Defense Command. As a force provider, ACC organizes, trains, equips, and maintains combat-ready forces for rapid deployment and employment while ensuring strategic air defense forces are ready to meet the challenges of peace and wartime air sovereignty and air defense missions. ACC prepares combat air forces to globally implement national policy by sponsoring the ATLANTIC STRIKE (AS) Exercise Program. AS is designed to provide realistic training in the conduct of the counter-land close battle for combat Aircrews, Joint Terminal Air Controllers, Intelligence, and Air Support Operations Squadron personnel. AS is conducted at Avon Park Air-Ground Training Complex, Avon Park, FL. The goal of AS is to train participants to effectively integrate Close Air Support across a broad spectrum of activity with special emphasis on digitally-aided voice and data transfer technology.</p>
<p>Description of requirements for the items to be acquired: Successful offeror shall maintain the SUAS that has sensor, voice and data communication capabilities having sufficient fidelity to "mimic" those provided by the Predator system to provide a training capability for Command and Control (C2) units, aircrews, and ground parties. Review attached Statement of Work.</p>
<p>This requirement is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set Aside.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541519 (Other Computer-Related Services).</p>
<p>Section 1: Price (Not to exceed 3 pages. Page size 8.5 x 11). If the lowest priced offeror is determined to be technically acceptable, no further evaluation will be made on other offers received for this procurement. If the lowest priced offeror is not determined to be technically acceptable, the Government will evaluate the next lowest priced offeror until a technically acceptable offer is identified. Price analysis techniques may include a comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation, comparison with other contract prices for similar services, and/or a comparison of proposed prices with the independent government cost estimate. Price will be evaluated on the total overall price and reasonableness. A combination of evaluation techniques will be accomplished IAW FAR 15.404-1(b). The Government will evaluate proposed prices to determine whether prices reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the various elements of the offeror's technical proposal.</p>
<p>Section 2: Technical Capability (Not to exceed 20 pages. Page size 8.5 x 11). The offeror must meet or exceed ALL technical evaluation factors to be determined technically acceptable. Technical capability will be assessed based on the following information provided by the offerors:</p>

Under this effort, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) intends to award a commercial contract utilizing FAR Part 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items, to acquire ninety-one (91), Thermite TVC 2.0 MDL 3520 computers (Part# 1090-3520-04).  The intended source for this acquisition is Quantum3D Inc., 6330 San Ignacio BLVD, San Jose CA, 95119.  Anticipated delivery date is 90 days after contract award for the first twenty-five (25) computers and by 30 September 2010 for the remaining sixty-six (66) computers (estimated award date 26 March 2010).  This acquisition is to procure Thermite Computers for use in conjunction with fielding the Kiowa Warrior Manned/Unmanned Level II (KW L2 MUM) System for the OH-58D. The Thermite, TVC-2.0 Model 3520 computer is a critical component of the KW L2 MUM system, and is the only system that is compatible, tested and validated with the MUM Level II electronics suite and currently tested with an air worthiness release for use in the MUM Level II System on the OH-58D aircraft. Quantum3D's Thermite TVC 2.0 MDL 3520 computer compatibility with the existing electronics package makes them the only source capable of providing the computers necessary in time to meet an aggressive schedule. Procurement of these components on an other than a sole-source basis will jeopardize critical deployment schedules, and further degrade force protection and readiness multiplying already serious risks of personnel casualties and loss or damage to aviation assets.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for Switchgear Maintenance for the following items:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Lawrenceville, GA campus, Bldgs S &amp; A, routine maintenance for building low voltage switchgear; and 2) Roybal Bldgs. 18 and 21, routine maintenance for building low voltage switchgear.&nbsp; All work to be performed in accordance with the Statement of Work.&nbsp; Low Voltage Switchgear Maintenance; Location: Roybal and Lawrenceville Campuses.&nbsp; The maintenance on the low-voltage switchgear breakers is required every 5 years.&nbsp; Scope:&nbsp; Testing will be performed on the draw-out breakers in the following low-voltage switchgear line-ups at the campuses listed below.&nbsp; (1) Lawrenceville - Building A, Westinghouse Switchgear, 15 Pow-R SPB Breakers; Building A, Square D PZIII Switchgear, 3 DSII Breakers; Building A, Eaton Magnum DS Switchgear, 3 MDS Breakers; Building S, Cutler Hammer DS Switchgear, 5 DS Breakers; (2)&nbsp;Roybal - Building 18, Eaton Magnum DS Switchgear, 27 MDS Breakers; and (3)&nbsp;Roybal - Building 21, Eaton Magnum DS Switchgear, 69 MDS Breakers.&nbsp; The maintenance shall include the following:&nbsp; 1. Primary current injection of each breaker; 2. Megger and ductor testing for each breaker; 3. Inspect condition of breaker clusters. Lubricate with medium weight oil, as needed, per manufacturer's recommendation; 4. Inspect condition of breaker arc chambers and advise on any corrective action needed; 5. Inspect condition of breaker contacts and advise on any corrective action needed; 6. Opening and closing of breakers to inspect mechanical operators; 7. Inspect mechanical components of breaker cell including racking mechanism and shutter mechanism, when supplied. Lubricate with medium weight oil, as needed, per manufacturer's recommendation; 8. A report that details the testing parameters and results for each breaker and any corrective actions needed.&nbsp; The CDC will provide a 480V/100A service that will be used to supply power to the vendor supplied testing equipment. All vendor test equipment must meet NFPA 70B-21.7. The calibration sticker shall be visible and dated within a year from when the actual service will be scheduled. No testing will be allowed on any CDC breakers unless the equipment calibration requirement is met. Because rolling outages will occur throughout the buildings, the work will be scheduled when convenient for the programs within the buildings. It will be unacceptable to schedule an outage with the programs only to reschedule because the vendor's equipment does not meet the specification. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the vendor to ensure all testing equipment meets this requirement prior to scheduling the work.&nbsp; The testing technician(s) performing the work shall be qualified to operate their equipment and thoroughly familiar with its use. He/she shall come equipped with the proper PPE and shall conduct all tests in a safe manner. He/she shall be familiar with the characteristics of the Time-Current Curves (TCC) of the breakers listed above and have the expertise in testing the electrical trip units using the TCCs and evaluating the test data. He/she shall be sufficiently experienced to detect any equipment abnormalities or questionable data during the performance of the tests. This work shall not be a training opportunity for any vendor technician; therefore any technician onsite shall already meet the qualifications to be there.&nbsp; All work will be performed outside of regularly scheduled CDC business hours. It will take place Monday-Thursday between the hours of 6:00pm and 5:00am or Saturday-Sunday between the hours of 6:00am and 8:00pm. Due to the critical nature of the buildings listed below, the CDC will determine the appropriate work schedule and grant the vendor a minimum of one week's notice for scheduling.

The vendor shall manufacture and deliver the requested item within no more than one-hundred twenty (150) days. This combined synopsis/solicitation is prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6 (http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart 12_6.html#wp1088488) in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation and award prescribed under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation that will be released. A Quote from vendors in this business area is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<p>Technical Specifications</p>
<p>The Environmental Test Chamber shall meet the following specifications. Substitutions are not acceptable.</p>
<p>1. Overall Size/Envelop Dimensions: The internal volume of the chamber shall be between 29 and 40 cubic feet, with a minimum internal width of 32 inches, a minimum internal height of 36 inches, and a minimum internal depth of 28 inches. The overall unit shall be no more than 60 inches wide and be no more than 87" tall. Maximum exterior dimensions allowed are width as facing access doors of 72 inches and depth of 48 inches. The maximum assembled installed height shall not exceed 100 inches including wheel assemblies. However, the height of the chamber shall be able to be adjusted to less than 7 feet to allow for movement thru doors when relocating the chamber.</p>
<p>2. Environmental Control Parameters: The chamber shall have electronic programmable temperature and humidity controllers capable of controlling the temperature of the chamber between 20F and 140F and the relative humidity between 10% and 98%. The temperature shall be controlled and maintained to +/- 1 degree F of set point. Relative humidity shall be controlled and maintained to +/- 2.5 % RH of set point. The maximum heat load expected in the chamber to be used for establishing the heat removal capacity is 1500 watts. Critical temperature control points per the UL-2034 test requirements are at 40F, 70F, and 120F.</p>
<p><br />3. Data Collection: The controller shall have two USB port interfaces and a user friendly touch screen system for ease of programming, data acquisition, and the capability to monitor chamber interior temperature and relative humidity conditions with 0-10v analog signal from an independent set of sensors. These ports are data passthroughs to access equipment inside the chamber. Additional (one each RS-232 and RS485) exterior data ports shall be provided so that the chamber conditions may be recorded by CPSC's external data acquisition system . These ports connect the the vendors chamber sensors and are outputs. The USB, RS-232 and RS-485 ports will interface with CPSC's data acquisition and control computer system (DACS) that uses National Instruments' LabView software for data acquisition and control. .Also, the chamber temperature and relative humidity control system shall be capable of being controlled by signal inputs (digital or 0-10v analog) from the CPSC DACS, through the RS-232 and RS-485 ports...</p>
<p>4. The chamber shall be furnished with heavy duty casters, have latching and gasketed insulated front and back access doors with high performance triple pane glass viewing windows. The wheels shall have locking features.</p>
<p>5. The unit may have either one or two doors. If supplied with two doors they would be on opposite sides of the chamber. Each door, when open shall provide full width free and unencumbered access to the interior of the chamber similar to CPSC's existing Lunaire Model CE0932W-4 that this chamber will be replacing.</p>
<p>6. A viewing panel will be provided on each door. Each viewing window/door panel shall have a minimum area of 1000 square inches and a width of at least 24 inches.

<p>Upon receipt of proposals, the Contract Specialist will review them to determine if each offeror followed all of the proposal preparation instructions in this solicitation. A proposal that did not follow the proposal submission instructions may be deemed unacceptable and may not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>Each proposal will be evaluated against the factors described below. An offeror's failure to address any factor may be considered indicative of the offeror's lack of understanding of the Government's requirements and may result in the quotation being determined unacceptable.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors:<br />1. Compliance with the minimum specifications: The Government will evaluate the offeror based on whether or not the system offered meets the minimum technical specifications. This is considered the most important Non-Cost evaluation factor.<br />2. Proof of prior experience from two (2) previous customers: The Government will evaluate the offeror based on the evidence that they provide of business they have done with other customers regarding the system proposed for this solicitation. Evidence of business with other customers for solutions other than what they are offering per this solicitation will not be considered relevant. This evidence should include the name of the previous customer, the product that was sold, and the date of the transaction.<br />3. Compliance with Section 508 Law: The Government will evaluate the offeror based on the level of compliance with the standards of Section 508 that were specified above demonstrated by their system. These standards are 1194.24, 1194.31, and 1194.41. More information on Section 508 Law can be found at www.section508.gov. Attached is a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT). Evidence of the level of compliance with section 508 shall be demonstrated via this template. All offerors must complete the necessary sections of the template and submit the completed template with their quotation.<br />4. Evaluated Cost/Price: The Government will evaluate whether the quoted cost/price is fair and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements and the requirement's estimated value, and is consistent with the offer's specifications.</p>
<p>Factors 1 through 3 are Non-Cost factors. Factor 1 is weighted the heaviest of the Non-Cost factors. Factors 2 and 3 are both equal in weight. When combined, Factors 2 and 3 are approximately equal in weight to Factor 1. Factor 4 is the Evaluated Cost/Price factor. The weight of Factor 4 is approximately equal to the total weight of Factors 1 through 3. <br /><br />The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the Government's interest.</p>
<p>The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations received.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a purchase order without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial quotation should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. <br /><br />Exchanges with Offerors after receipt of a quotation do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.</p>

The location of the waste storage facility is planned in the approximate center of the enclosed location map, just north of L. Manatawny Creek.

A Phase I Cultural Resources Survey of the area concluded that the historic component of Site
36BK0905 does not possess the qualities of significance and integrity defined in the National Register of Historic Places Criteria and therefore does not represent a historic property. However, the prehistoric component of the property needs further evaluation.

The goal of the Phase II Survey is to determine if the prehistoric component of the site qualifies for listing in the National Register of Historic Places and to provide recommendations for the government to evaluate.

See Attached Request for Quotation to this notice.

PLEASE RESPOND WITH ANY INQUITIES OR QUESTIONS VIA EMAIL.
ABSOLUTELY NO PHONE CALLS  WILL BE ENTERTAINED.
THE RFQ  MUST BE RECEIVED BY CLOSING DATE.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

Anticipated award date is on or about 20 March 2010. Contact Ryan Suchy at 252-334-5472 or ryan.m.suchy@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only publication. A written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number M6700110Q0086 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).

Line Item #0001:  Brand Name or Equal SureFire 6P LED is a compact high-output flashlight featuring a hard-anodized aerospace aluminum body. It uses a virtually indestructible power-regulated LED and a precision micro-textured reflector to produce a smooth 80-lumen beamfour times the light of a big two-D-cell flashlight, and more than enough to temporarily blind and disorient an aggressor by impairing his night-adapted vision. The tactically-correct pushbutton tailcap switch provides secure, ergonomic activation control: press for momentary-on, twist for constant-on. Qty 30
Line Item #0002: Brand Name or Equal MichHelmet the helmet is trimmed higher on the sides than the standard TBH II or ACH helmets to accommodate various headsets with earcups that protrude outward toward the bottom, such as GenCOM III and Comtac headsets.  The helmet shell provides ballistic protection for the covered area in accordance with MIL-STD-662, 2150 FPS and Level IIIA velocities per PS-0324/D12302.  A reduced profile provides expanded upward and peripheral field of view for improved situational awareness.  The helmet provides improved interface with protective goggles and NVG components, sighting systems, and other equipment.  A four-point, fully adjustable retention system provides stability and comfort.  The suspension system includes adjustable-thickness sizing pads for uniform compression and a snug fit. The pads are designed to accommodate headband-style headsets.  A compatible integrated communication system, a night vision goggle (NVG) mounting bracket, and various helmet covers are available.  Qty 40 ( 10 Med, 15 Large and 15 Xlarge all with 3 pre drilled holes)
Line Item #0003: Brand Name or Equal Wilcox L3 G12 NVG Mounting System for One and Three Hole Helmet Configurations with NVG Lanyard and Universal NVG Mount allows firm attachment of an NVG to a MICH/ACH helmet drilled with the standard one- and three-hole patterns. This NVG Mounting System is unique in that it provides three modes of operation. The first mode allows the Mount to break away from the base under a stressed condition, such as when prompted by interference during fast roping, maritime operations, hard impact or when entering or exiting mobility platforms. Without the breakaway feature, the potential for induced neck injury and NVG breakage are increased. The second mode allows the Universal NVG Mount to securely lock the mount to the base. A third mode allows the Breakaway Base to pivot away from the Helmet Bracket by means of a locking bayonet interface when the NVG is not in use, further reducing weight and profile. Qty 40

<DESC>Q)  Can you provide more detail on ranking/scoring of proposals? is their a scoring system beyond that listed in the solicitation? will you use sample image, rendering or models provided in proposals to base your selection?<BR><BR>A)  The proposers can include a sample graphic or drawing but I do not see how I can evaluate them any other way than what is listed on the FBO solicitation.<BR><BR>Q)  Do you have budget limitations?<BR><BR>A)  Yes, but nothing that will be shared.<BR><BR>Q)  The solicitation states Demonstrated knowledge of Army presentation graphical needs. We have done all types of presentations. Is there an Army presentation format for presentations and if so, can you provide the name and location.<BR><BR>A)  What I was referring to there was preparing a graphic or requested item based on whatever venue we were presenting at. For example if it was a VIP Day presentation or an AUSA poster, those are high visibility marketing venues that require some attention getting designs rather than say a briefing on ATO requirements or a briefing to a general officer that require more subdued approaches. This is really tough to quantify except to say I expect them to be able to generate something based on the type of presentation not just the engineering or equipment being presented.<BR><BR>Q)  Would you please explain the term overarching graphics representation? Is this a general term or an existing system used? Please provide greater understanding what is being communicated.<BR><BR>A)  By overarching I am referring to complete system of system views. I may be looking for a graphic representation of lethality, headgear, power and networking included together in one image, not just a picture of any one component or subsystem independently.<BR><BR>Q)  Please explain what steps have been taken to control the disclosure of IP in the proposal process and during the contract process?<BR><BR>A)  Two statutes protect proprietary information submitted by offerors under government solicitations.  First, the Trade Secrets Act, 18 USC  1905, provides for criminal penalties against any government employee who knowingly discloses trade secrets received in the course of official business.  Second, the Procurement Integrity Act, 41 USC  423, provides a series of safeguards to assure that proprietary information, as well as non-proprietary source selection information, is protected from disclosure throughout the competition and thereafter.<BR><BR>The key to assuring the confidentiality of proprietary information is that it be properly marked by the submitter.  In certain circumstances, proprietary information must be identified pursuant to a specific FAR clause (see e.g., DFARS 252.227-7017) when the proposal is submitted, but for the most part, the proscription against release of proprietary information is broadly applied to all proposal information.<BR><BR>If the proposal is selected for award, certain elements of the contract become public records.  However, individual unit pricing may still be protected from release under the Freedom of Information Act, if the contractor can show business harm resulting from the proposed release.  In addition, name of individual contractor employees are typically redacted under FOIA and the Privacy Act, even if the contract is released to a private entity under FOIA.<BR><BR>Q)  Is there a start date or window?<BR><BR>A)  Start window is date of award.<BR><BR>Q)  Is there current, past or planned specification for his work?<BR><BR>A)  No.

<DESC>1.  If the 65.65% SBA participation is a percent of the subcontractors' participation, then what is the SBA participation goal as a percent of the total contract?
Government Response: There is no definitive answer to your question. The 65.65% is the NAVFAC subcontracting goals. Each firm will need to determine the actual total dollars planned to be subcontracted to small business. For example, if the total amount of subcontracted dollars is $700,000.00, out of the $700,000.00, 65.65% should be allocated for small business. The total subcontracted dollars may or may not reflect the total dollar value of the contract.
2. Is this commitment to Small Business intended to reflect the goal percentages of the total contract value of the IDIQ, $28M (i.e. 65.65% of $28M) or the goal percentages of the amount that is subcontracted out to Small Businesses (i.e. if 42.5% of the work is subcontracted out, then a goal of 65.65% of the 42.5%)?
Government Response: Please refer to the government's responses to questions 14 and 15 in the previous modification.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the details from the questions and answers received, and to extend the offer due date.
The hour and date specified for receipt of quotes is extended  to March 12, 2010, at 4:00pm.
The following is the Questions and Answers:
Question 1: With regards to fuel for the charter vessel, if it is not going to be used on a consumption usage basis, can I get an idea of how many hours a day the vessel will need to be underway?  Also, how many miles is the area stretch where the capturing will take place?
Answer 1: It is difficult to predict how much we will need to move around to find suitable areas for catching sea otters and avoiding rough weather, but typically, once we find a good spot, we can anchor up for 2-4 days and then move to another spot for 2-4 days and so on until we meet our capture goals.  However, if sheltered areas for anchoring the charter vessel overnight are not sufficiently close to the otter capture sites that they can be reached easily by small skiffs, then it may be necessary for the charter vessel to move closer to the otter capture sites on a daily basis.  About 55 nm separates the two target areas (the mouth of Nuchatlitz Inlet and Vargas Island/Tofino), but again, how far we need to travel within each area to capture enough sea otters is hard to predict because it depends on the number of otters and the weather conditions we encounter. Question 2: The RFQ states Western Vancouver Island, is this referring to the Pacific Ocean exposed side of the Island?  
Answer 2: Yes. Question 3: Is it possible to have the vessel inspection completed in Southern California instead of Washington?  
Answer 3: No.
Offers must acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to the hour and date specified in the Comibined Synopsis / Solicitation by one of the following methods:
1 - By acknowledging receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted;
2 - By a separate letter or email that inlcudes a reference to the solicitation amendment number 0001.
FAILURE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO BE RECEIVED AT THE PLACE DESIGNATED FOR THE RECEIPT OF QUOTATIONS PRIOR TO THE HOUR AND DATE SPECIFIED MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF YOUR OFFER.  
If by virtue of the amendment you desire to change an offer already submitted, such change may be made by letter or email, provided that the letter or email references the above-mentioned amendment number, and is received prior to the offer due date specified.

<p>Services required within the scope of this requirement include technical support; hardware and software installation and integration; database and software development; continued development and deployment of existing JSMPS/JIST tools and capabilities; continued updating and employment of key SATCOM management and planning data; data manipulation and presentation; testing, demonstration, and fielding of developed software systems; and requisite hardware and software sustainment and support activities. JSMPS/JIST will be matured into a fully net-centric, web-enabled database and application suite with a hardware, software, and support architecture to meet the needs of DoD SATCOM stakeholders. The resulting tools and capabilities will provide a robust and secure environment for collaborative Electro-magnetic and Radio Frequency Interference (EMI/RFI) detection, tracking, analysis and mitigation. To accomplish this, JSMPS/JIST would expand existing capabilities encompassing assignment and execution data for all remaining DOD SATCOM systems, acquire needed data from existing and programmed SATCOM system management and planning applications and databases, and make this data readily available as an integrated and user-defined operational picture. To support better Intelligence Community (IC) participation in EMI resolution, JSMPS would be deployed on the JWICS network enclave with a cross-domain solution allowing for near-real time data refreshing from the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) JSMPS/JIST. JSMPS will connect to existing databases to provide data and products for Telemetry Tracking &amp; Control (TT&amp;C) data for all space systems to effectively support EMI resolution. Finally, JSMPS/JIST shall be available and sustainable while data is appropriately protected and secure.</p>
<p>On-site work may be performed at either of the following Government installations:</p>
<p>USSTRATCOM<br />Building 500<br />Offutt AFB, NE 68113-6600</p>
<p>AFSPC <br />Buildings 1470 &amp; 1471 <br />Peterson AFB, CO 80914-3050</p>
<p>All contractor personnel working any direct tasking on the project shall hold a minimum current SECRET security clearance (an interim SECRET clearance is acceptable for newly assigned personnel whose final clearance is still being completed). To work on-site within USSTRATCOM/J661 or within the GSSC, contractor personnel shall have a minimum TOP SECRET clearance and be eligible for Special Compartmented Information (SCI) indoctrination.</p>
<p>The RFP and all associated documents, when issued, will be posted on the required government-wide point of entry. No solicitation is available at this time. Offerors are encouraged to subscribe/register for this solicitation number through http://www.fedbizops.gov to ensure they automatically receive all documents associated with the procurement in a timely manner. All associated documents will be released electronically. The NAICS code is 541512. Anticipated award date is Fall 2010.</p>
<p>Address questions via email to the contract specialist or contracting officer only. No discussions will be conducted telephonically.</p>

<DESC>Note: This is the same effort referenced on FedBizOpps # FA8622-09-D-5999-0100.
This notice is a sources sought synopsis with specific interest in small business capability. No solicitation is being issued at this time; while a formal solicitation may be issued at a later date, this notice does not commit the government to ultimately award a contract. The work is for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This notice is prepared in accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This synopsis is published with the intent of determining whether sufficient interest exists to solicit the requirement as a small business set aside under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712, "Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)/Aircraft Parts, and Auxiliary Equipment, and Aircraft Engine Parts," size standard of 1,500 employees. 
The Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Material Command, intends to award one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity A&AS contract(s) for the work characterized in the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). The contract period of performance is anticipated to be five (5) years, with no option periods, and the ceiling is anticipated to be three billion ($3,000,000,000.00) dollars. Small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting," applies, wherein "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."
Responses to this synopsis shall include the following information:
1. State your interest in performing in the capacity of the prime contractor or as a subcontractor.
2. State your company's business size and status (including but not limited to: small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, women-owned small business, historically under-utilized business zone (HUBZone) small business) in conjunction with NAICS code 541712, size standard of 1,500 employees.
3. State your company's CAGE code as listed in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR), and a point of contact (POC) name, telephone number, and e-mail address. 
Strategy - One or more ID/IQ contracts would be awarded, comprising a consolidated scope, constituting all studies, projects, deliverables, and Professional and Management Assistance (PMA) for all labor categories contained in the attached draft PWS (the prime contractor and team on each awarded contract would be responsible for performing in all labor categories). Note that this award strategy requires prime contractors to propose on all labor categories. If interested in this award strategy, please respond as stated above and state your industry perspective as to the pros and cons of this approach. 
Do not mark your information "company proprietary" or with any other type of restriction. Any information submitted will become the property of the Government. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this or future requests. Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement. Responses shall be made via e-mail to jonathan.taliani@wpafb.af.mil with courtesy copies to alexander.slate@wpafb.af.mil and laura.bushong@wpafb.af.mil. All pertinent information will be available for viewing at FedBizOpps (FBO), http://www.fbo.gov, and The Preaward Information Exchange System (PIXS), https://pixs.wpafb.af.mil/. It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review these sites frequently for updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with FAR 52.204-7, "Central Contractor Registration," lack of registration in CCR, available at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx! , will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. Additionally, in accordance with FAR 52.204-8, "Annual Representations and Certifications," offerors are also reminded to register with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov. Please provide responses by 17 March 2010. Any questions shall be addressed via e-mail to jonathan.taliani@wpafb.af.mil.
Please refer to the current CAPS contract information, Attachment 3, CAPS Contract Labor Categories, 16 Oct 07, for a starting place. Assume the ability to add additional labor categories as needed.
At the present time, another industry day is anticipated once the government is prepared to give more definitive answers regarding strategy intentions. This date is to be determined and industry will be advised of updates.

<DESC><strong>This modification is to change proposed NAICS code to 541620.<br /><br />Introduction:</strong> "This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement." The proposed NAICS code for this requirement is 541620.<br /><br /><strong>Background.</strong> The search for the cause of an identified cancer cluster is often fruitless due to the existence of multiple exposure sources, lack of historical exposure data, and a mobile population. When the cancer in question has no known cause, the challenge is even greater, as in the polycythemia vera (PV) cluster recently identified in northeastern Pennsylvania (1). The cluster area is roughly 200 square miles, bounded by Hazleton in the north and Tamaqua in the south, and has a long record of mining, industrial, and hazardous waste releases to the environment, both historical and ongoing. Many of the releases are associated either directly or indirectly with the mining of anthracite coal. Although anthracite coal is no longer actively mined in the area, previous surface and underground mining activities (from the 1880s through the 1960s) have left large residuals of coal refuse (culm). The coal refuse has been used to fuel fluidized bed combustion (FBC) cogeneration power plants, six of which have been in operation in the cluster area region since the early 1990s. Over the years, abandoned underground and surface mines have been used as a convenient way to dispose of a variety of industrial contaminants (e.g. McAdoo &amp; Associates Site) and, more recently, ash from the FBC plants. Local residents and physicians in the cluster area are especially concerned about the elevated number of PV cases because of the nearby Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund sites (McAdoo Associates, Eastern Diversified Metals, and Tonolli Corp), and a waste-coal power plant (NEPCO). ATSDR is currently funding projects that will evaluate the surface water outflow from the McAdoo Site, and test soil, water, and indoor air at current and past residences of PV patients for environmental contaminants and radiation. Potential pathways of environmental exposure could include air inhalation, drinking water consumption, food ingestion, skin contact or a combination of exposure routes. Studying each of these pathways may be necessary to identify any empirical evidence that would suggest a correlation between the pathway and the incidence of PV in the tri-county area. The focus of the proposed work is on potential sources, pathways and exposures associated air and drinking water. ATSDR is currently compiling a data warehouse of all available environmental data from the cluster area (the PAPV Data Warehouse), which will be made available to the contractor. ATSDR will also assist the contractor in obtaining additional documents or data that are deemed relevant to this work from local, state and federal agencies.
<p>This exposure assessment analysis is an integral part of a comprehensive ATSDR public health response investigating the occurrence, trends, and associated risk factors of PV and other MyeloProliferative Diseases (MPDs), not only in the cluster area in Pennsylvania, but also on a national level. The data collected by ATSDR as a result of this work will allow us to better respond to cancer clusters with suspected environmental origins. In addition, our understanding of the etiology of MPDs and other hematological cancers will be greatly enhanced leading to improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives.</strong> To (1) examine the hydrogeology of the project area to evaluate relationships between present and past PV case residences in the cluster area and the sources of potable water (publicly owned water supplies, privately owned water supplies and the aquifers that supply private residential wells) used in these areas, (2) estimate the current and past exposures of study area residents to specific air pollutants from local and regional sources, and (3) address the informational needs of the community and establish regular lines of communication with the Community Action Committee on issues related to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements.</strong> 1. Cluster area hydrogeology and sources of potable water. This work will include a comprehensive review of existing studies, data and other information on the hydrogeology of the cluster area; identification of current and past sources of municipal and private drinking water throughout the cluster area, and the relationship of common drinking water sources to PV patient-occupied residences; evaluation of available water testing data to assess the quality of drinking water in the cluster area at the present time, and when possible, during specific time periods in the past (back to 1950) to determine whether specific contaminants are/were present in water supplies used in cluster areas; and field testing such as core sampling, tracer studies, and water analysis to fill gaps identified in the above work.</p>
<p>2. Air Pollution Exposure Assessment. This work will evaluate the present and past exposures of cluster-area residents to specific air pollutants from local and regional sources. Specific tasks include identification and characterization of air pollution sources, atmospheric dispersion modeling and analyses, air pollutant monitoring, and recommendations for supplemental work needed to fill gaps identified in the review.</p>
<p>3. Communications with Community Representatives. This effort will require working closely with the local communities, and addressing their informational needs by establishing regular lines of communication with the Community Action Committee (CAC) on issues related to the project.</p>

Amendment 0001 to the Solicitation, AG-9702-S-10-0106, is attached.  The amendment is issued because of the adverse weather conditions within the project site.  Therefore, a site visit may not be accomplished.  Instead of quoting a lump sum price to the statement of work, I have included the quantities under Section B, Schedule of Items and added appropriate clauses to the solicitation.

You may download the amendment which consists of three pages below.

<DESC>This project is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) of on-base facilities for Elmendorf AFB, Eielson AFB, associated sites outside of the Base proper, various remote sites, and Fort Richardson, Alaska. The MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades. Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed$20M per year up to $100M over a five-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods. The government may award as many as six (6) contracts. <br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $33.5M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $33.5M. <br />It has been determined that competition will be limited to 8(a) firms serviced by the SBA Alaska District Office or 8(a) firms with a bonafide branch office in the Alaska District Office area which have the applicable NAICS code in their 8(a) business development plan. All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers. Competition will not be restricted by stage of 8(a) program participation. Joint Venture Agreements: Joint Ventures are allowable on competitive 8(a) set-asides. The Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) and all supporting documents [i.e. tax returns, financial statements, narratives, checklists, etc.] must be submitted as soon as possible but no less than twenty (20) working days prior to the scheduled date for contract award. Incomplete packages will be returned without action. The joint venture agreement must be approved prior to award of any resulting contract. Failure to obtain SBA's approval of the JVA prior to award will result in SBA's request to the buying activity to terminate the award. If you are contemplating a joint venture on this project, you must advise your assigned Business Opportunity Specialist (BOS) as soon as possible. <br />The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3). In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Army/Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably. While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective. This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference. The RFP will identify a model project. All successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $2,500.00. The government may compete future individual requirements among the awardees. An actual solicitation is expected to be issued on or about 15 Mar 10. The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The magnitude of the model project is between $250,000 - $500,000.00. The entire solicitation, including MACC General Provision and a model project package, will be made available only on Electronic Posting System (EPS) single government point of entry (GPE) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov at that time. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package. Potential offerors MUST register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation. All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov.
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.</p>

Contracting Office Address
Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, Parklawn Building Room 5-101 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD, 20857, UNITED STATES

Description

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Head Start, through the Program Support Center (PSC), has a requirement to procure State Training and Technical Assistance Centers that will provide local grantees with high-quality, sustained, and intensive training and technical assistance that, to the maximum extent practicable, improves the capacity of local programs to deliver services that meet or exceed the standards described in section 641 (A)(a)(1) of the Head Start Act, within the following areas:

	School readiness
	Training/career development needs of staff
	Correction of deficiencies

The Office of Head Start is seeking the procurement of up to 52 State Training and Technical Assistance Centers that will secure services of at least one Early Childhood Education specialist in every state of the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico who possess demonstrable and credible experience in the field of early childhood education. Specific expertise is sought from offerors providing training and technical assistance strategies that positively impact the developmental and educational outcomes for children birth to five. 

Each state will include at least one early childhood education (ECE) specialist, with the number of ECE specialists increased in accord with the number of grantees and delegates within a state. The work of these specialists will be directed toward two of the three priority areas: school readiness and the training/career development needs of teaching staff. In each state one ECE specialist shall function as the Center Manager. 

The Early Childhood Education (ECE) specialist position requires a degree and qualifications in Early Childhood Education/Development at the bachelors degree level with masters degree preferred and a minimum of five years experience in programs for young children. In states with only one ECE specialist, the degree and experience for that specialist must be inclusive of both birth to three and three to five year old development and  learning. This experience should include the provision of training and technical assistance to teachers/home visitors and education managers.  For states staffed by more than one ECE specialist, the education and experience of one specialist may be specific to children from birth to three; the education and experience of the second specialist may be specific to children from three to five. For states staffed by more than one specialist, it is also recommended that each specialist have experience and/or education with the implementation of effective strategies for working with unique special populations of children. 

In addition, the government is seeking to secure the services of at least one Grantee Specialist for each of the ten ACF Regions. These specialists will be deployed by the regional office to work on the third priority area: deficiencies identified through the monitoring system. In regions with few grantees with identified deficiencies, the grantee specialists may also be deployed to work with grantees with multiple areas of noncompliance, grantees with concerns raised through risk management meetings, or with grantees about which concerns have been raised though other data sources, such as the Program Information Report (PIR). In order to facilitate and support close communication between these grantee specialists and the regional office, these specialists will be employed by the TTA Center in the State where the regional office is located. 

These states are as follows:

	Region I  Massachusetts
	Region II  New York
	Region II  Philadelphia
	Region IV  Georgia
	Region V  Illinois
	Region VI  Texas
	Region VII  Missouri
	Region VIII  Colorado
	Region IX  California
	Region X - Washington

The Grantee Specialist position requires a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science (BA or BS) Degreewith a preference for a Masters degree in a field related to program design and management. A minimum of five years experience in the provision of training and technical assistance and consultation with directors, boards of directors, staff and parents; and experience analyzing and redesigning systems for grantees. Both positions, the Early Childhood Specialist and the Grantee Specialist, require a significant background in the use of reliable data collection systems that track measurable outcomes for children and programs.

Finally, there will be one TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialist for each of the ten regions. (See above.) As is true with the grantee specialists, this individual will be employed by the state Center in which the regional office is located. The TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialist will work with regional office staff to coordinate the work of the State TTA Centers within that region. 

The TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialist requires a BA or BS Degreewith a preference for a Masters degree in a field related to program design and management. A minimum of five years experience in the provision of training and technical assistance and consultation with directors, boards of directors, staff and parents; experience analyzing and redesigning systems for grantees.

The number of Early Childhood Education Specialists, Grantee Specialists, and TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialists depend upon the number of grantees and delegates per state.  Attachment 1 provides the estimated level of effort in each state.

Offerors may propose staff that lives near, but not in, the state for which the capability statement is being written. However, it is required that all individuals have some relationships established with the early education community in that state.

To provide economies of scale, the use of home offices is strongly encouraged. Services may be provided off-site, on-site, through virtual media, or a combination thereof.  

In states  where less than three Early Childhood Education Specialists are to be proposed (see Section 3.1.1 (b)  Contraints  Staffing Based on Size of Head Start Programs by State),  offerors are encouraged to propose a consortium of two or more states situated within that ACF Region in order to maximize resources. Consortium proposals are subject to the Regional restrictions below:

Region 1:  No consortium shall include Maine or Rhode Island but any other combination of Region 1 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.

 Region 2:  No consortium shall include Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands but any other combination of Region 2 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.

Region 3:  No consortium shall include Delaware, Pennsylvania, or Washington, D.C., but any other combination of Region 3 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.

Region 4:  No consortium shall include Mississippi or South Carolina but any other combination of Region 4 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.

Region 5:  Any combination of Region 5 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.

Region 6:  No consortium shall include Arkansas or New Mexico but any other combination of Region 6 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.

Region 7:  No consortium shall include Iowa but any other combination of Region 7 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.

Region 8:  No consortium shall include North Dakota or South Dakota but any other combination of Region 8 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.

Region 9:  No consortium shall include any states in Region 9.

Region 10:  No consortium shall include Alaska but any other combination of Region 10 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged. 

It is anticipated that up to 52 cost-reimbursement type contracts will be awarded for a 60-month period.  Responses to the Request for Proposal package will be due within 30 calendar days following the actual date of issuance of the RFP.  Award of this requirement is anticipated by July 31, 2010.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the PSC. 

For further information, contact Erica Binnix in Room 5-101, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.

<DESC>This modification is to add the RFP by an attached WORD document and also to clarify the following on the SF 1449:Block 12:  This would be any discount terms your company would offer.  An example would be a 2% percentage savings to the Government if we were to pay within 10 days of invoice versus 30 days from the invoice.  You would leave this block blank if you were not offering a discount for prompt payment.Block 17a:   This would be your companys name, address and phone number.Block 21:  As stated in the solicitation on page 5, the Government estimates 50 record per year would be reviewed so you would enter "50" in this block.Block 22:  Unit should be "Each" since this would be 50 records per year.Block 23:  Enter the unit price cost per record review or for reading/diagnosing patient EEG/sleep and evoked potential records.Block 24:  This would be the total amount.  Block 22 times Block 23.You also need to complete the base year price and all four option years prices in the Schedule of Supplies/Services/Price/Costs section of the RFP (should be pages 5 and 6).  The Quantity is 50 since this is the estimated amount of patient records that Wilmington VA Medical Center believes will be read/diagnosed.  The Unit is entered as Each so you just need to enter the unit cost and total cost for the base year and the four option years.  Blocks 30a, 30b, and 30c:  These need to be completed and mailed to me in three copies by 25 Mar 10.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION.  For Informational Purposes Only.  This action is awarded under Modification no. A112 that recognizes Work Authorization (WA) No. SL-100036-20479-10, Revision 1 (no Revision 0 issued) (LASO # RA-10-022) and is issued under Management and Operating (M&O) Contract number DE-AC52-06NA25396. This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars. The M&O Contractor DUNS number is 175252894. The description of the work involved under this Work Authorization is shown below:

The objective of this project is the development of the new heat transfer fluid technology designed to reduce Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) to make Solar Thermal Energy (STE) production competitive with other base load power production methodologies helping the Department of Energy (DOE) meet its 2015 and 2030 solar power production goals. This will be achieved by increasing the thermal stability of the Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF) to allow operation at 600C and the development of Thermal Energy Storage materials to allow STE to expand power production to times when sunlight is less available. The proposed technology development effort is comprised of three technical thrusts working in concert to form an integrated heat transfer fluid package. The first focuses on methodologies to stabilize a silicone working fluid at temperatures approaching 600C.  These silicone stabilizing methodologies are built upon the premise of introducing structural elements into the silicone fluid that inhibit the formation of the requisite transition state necessary for degradation. The second thrust focuses on the development of a new latent heat storage mechanism utilizing reversible chemical reactions for capturing, storing, and releasing high quality heat. The proposed technical effort addresses the development of these reactions by tuning reaction enthalpies and entropies to maximize thermal heat transfer performance. The third technical thrust involves integrating the latent heat storage chemical reactions into the silicone-based working fluid. The integration of fluid and latent heat reaction will be supported by detailed reaction product analysis to elucidate the presence of side reactions that could inhibit fluid performance and attenuate latent heat storage. The proposed effort is supported by detailed analysis of fluid properties which will be symbiotically relayed back into fluid development tasks as well as engineering analysis. Although the primary end results of these engineering analyses is to evaluate the utility of this fluid mixture for applications, these studies will also be used to iteratively guide the Research and Development (R&D) efforts toward optimizing desirable chemical properties. 

Once suitable integration methodologies are developed, an instrumented test bed will be constructed to allow performance evaluation. The resulting latent heat storage material and fluids will be performance tested for their ability to capture, store and release thermal heat as both a HTF as well as the ability to act as a secondary Thermal Energy Storage material. It is expected that when these development efforts are assembled the resulting heat transfer fluid package will operate at temperatures approaching 600C with extremely high latent heat storage capability.

<DESC>THE NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER (GRC) AWARDED UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY ANDREINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 A TASK ORDER FOR ENGINEERING SUPPORT SERVICES UNDER THEPREVIOUSLY AWARDED, COMPETITIVE 8(a) CONTRACT NNC06BA07B WITH ASRC AEROSPACE CORPORATION. &lt;P&gt;NASA Glenn Research Center has committed support for specific efforts under the AmericanRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Recovery act funds for NASAs FundamentalAeronautics Program (FAP) are being utilized to design, develop and test aircraft-engineUltra High Bypass (UHB) component technology hardware for the Environmentally ResponsibleAviation (ERA) Project, Vehicle Systems Sub-Project, Propulsion Airframe IntegrationElement, High Speed UHB Integration Task Sub-Element. The goals of the ERA Project areto reduce the amount of fuel burned by aircraft today by 33% and reduce the hazardousexhaust gas Nitrogen Oxide, which is responsible for hurting the Earths Ozone Layer, by70%. Less fuel burned also means much less Carbon Dioxide, one of the gases responsiblefor Global Warming, put into the atmosphere by aircraft engines. &lt;P&gt;NASA has the capability to test scale models that can simulate an aircraft engine byitself or while installed on a model aircraft wing in NASA wind tunnel facilities. Someof these scale models are concepts of the next generation of todays aircraft engines,called turbofans. The wind tunnel testing is performed to determine the performance ofnew turbofan engine designs and their effect on the aircraft aerodynamic performance. Aspecial test rig is used to power these model turbofans called a Turbine PoweredSimulator, or TPS. &lt;P&gt;To enable future propulsion-airframe integration testing of advanced UHB turbofans,design and fabrication of a representative UHB fan and stators for testing on a TPS willbe performed. And, because of the severe operating conditions the TPS unit endures duringtesting, the TPS and support systems require inspection and rebuilding after every testcampaign or before its use in the next test campaign. This means the TPS unit must betaken apart, the parts looked at with special equipment and techniques, the worn outparts replaced or rebuilt, instrumentation repaired or replaced, and the TPS put backtogether. The lubrication system must have seals, hoses and any broken sensors replaced.The TPS unit control system must also be inspected and defective parts replaced. It alsorequires software upgrades to be able to control the unit correctly for the next testcampaign for any special operating test points to be explored. This work requiresspecially trained people and special equipment to do all the tasks needed to make the TPSdrive unit operate as it was originally designed &lt;P&gt;NASA/GRC has issued a task order under existing contract NNC06BA07B for engineeringservices to complete the aerodynamic and mechanical design and fabrication of a new fanand set of stators to fit an existing NASA Turbine Powered Simulator (TPS) air motor,Model Number 2601 (2601). This fan model will be used to conduct research on the nextgeneration of Ultra High Bypass Wing Integration Technology in future wind tunnel tests.The engineering contractor will also focus on the refurbishment and upgrade of the TPS2601 and its system components in order to insure the TPS unit can be operated safelyduring testing. This effort will involve the inspection and rebuilding of the parts ofthe TPS 2601 itself and the oil Lubrication Cart. &lt;P&gt;THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. &lt;P&gt;A CPAF order is appropriate for this procurement because of the uncertain nature of theresearch/testing support activities required cannot be estimated to the level of accuracynecessary to allow the use of a fixed-priced contractual vehicle.
