<CONTACT>CAMILLE A. WARFIELD, Contract Specialist, Phone: (513) 487-2095, E-Mail: Warfield.Camille@epa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106-1(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeks to award a contract on a Sole Source basis to Wasson-ECE Instrumentation to provide an Oxygen Selective Flame Ionization Detector (OFID) for EPA?s National Vehicle and Fuels Emission Laboratory?s (NVFEL)Assessments and Standards Division (ASD).  ASD will use the OFID standard test method to perform analysis of the concentration of oxygenated components in gasoline motor fuels as required by 40 CFR Parts 80 and 86.  The required method is ASTM D5599. 	EPA originally purchased three (3) benzene-OFID combined systems more than 10 years ago.  The original manufacturer is no longer able to support these old and obsolete systems.  A new benzene-OFID system is needed in order to continue the analysis of benzene and oxygenates in fuel.  Market research has proven that only one manufacturer, Wasson-ECE Instrumentation, is able to provide this instrumentation.  	The specifications for the Agilent Technologies 6890 Gas Chromatograph with Flame Ionization and Thermal Conductivity Detectors (FID/TCD) are as follows: a Methanizer; O-FID catalytic reactor; one (1) 6-port switching valve and one (1) pneumatic actuator; necessary packed and capillary analytical columns; auxiliary isothermal oven; necessary restrictors and fittings and; OMI-2 indicating purifier assembly.  The components analyzed using the oxygenate-specific detector (O-FID) include: methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE); ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE); tert-amylmethylether (TAME); diisopropyl ether (DIPE); methanol; ethanol; isopropanol; n-propanol; isobutanol; tert-butanol; sec-butanol; n-butanol; tert-pentanol and ; dimethoxyethane.   	The TCD detects benzene and toluene.  The lower detection limit for the O-FID is 0.05 1t%.  A lower detection limit of 0.06% is expected for benzene and toluene.  The Dynamic gas Blender for O-FID carrier gas shall provide 95% helium, 5% hydrogen blend from independent pressurized helium and hydrogen sources.  Includes necessary regulators, manifold, and associated hardware.  Also includes method development, test chromatograms, documentation, on-site installation and training, and one (1) year limited warranty of the application and installed hardware, excluding consumables.  Performance is warranted to ASTM D3606 and ASTM D5599 specifications.  Unit shall also include: Agilent 6890 Series with EPC-G1530N gas chromatograph; Agilent 6890AutoInjector Model 7683; Agilent 100 sample tray for use with Model 7683 AutoSampler, #G2614A; Optional Wasson-ECE Service Tool Kit K1006.   	This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting documentation to the office identified above which establishes that their specifications meet the EPA?s requirement.  Documentation must be received within seven (7) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the EPA.  A determination by EPA not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) Antibody and Protein Purification Unit (APPU) intends to procure on a sole source basis for a Infinite M200 Monochromator-based Modular Multi-function Microplate Reader from Tecan U.S., PO Box 13953, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709.  The NCI has a Materials Transfer Agreement (MTA) with Microgenics Corp. for the development of assays of cancer related proteins using their patented Cedia reagent technology and peptide specific antibodies.  This technology requires an instrument with dual injector capabilities for small volumes that can read visible and fluorescent substrates with optics capable of extreme spectral purity as well as sensitive detectors for luminescent dependent assays.  In addition the APPU is developing a novel method for small molecule drug discovery using Cedia technology that requires colorimetric, fluorimetric and luminimetric substrates as reporters.  This detector is required for the developmental, validation and routine testing stages of our initiative in 96 and 384 well formats.  For fluorescence assays the detector has an spectrally enhanced PMT which extends the emission wavelength range up to 850 nm; allowing the APPU to further increase the sensitivity of their assays by using infra-red dyes which have no background auto-fluorescence.  For luminescence assays the instrument has a special photon counting luminescent detector that is extremely sensitive and capable of dual color luminescence readings.  The Tecan infinite 200 is the only instrument known to the NCI Researcher that comes with dual injection capability, has three separate detection systems; one each for colorimetric, fluorimetric and luminescent detection; and uses two separate dual grating monochromators for UV/visible and fluorescent excitation wavelengths, which makes their assays possible at low ligand concentrations because the dual monochromators eliminate secondary spectral emissions which increase background noise.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on February 7, 2006.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.  In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 334516; Size Standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to procure an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle  (AUV) or Autonomous Surface Vehicle
(ASV) for the National Ocean Service’s (NOS) Office of Coast Survey (OCS) Coast Survey Development Laboratory.  OCS desires to identify AUVs or ASVs that could be deployed in conjunction with manned assets to provide a rapid response capability for underwater domain awareness of ports, harbors, and inland waterways.  The operational concept is to use the autonomous vehicle to augment the capability of the manned surface vessel to detect and map cubic features as small as 30 centimeters in water depths up to 50 meters.  The goals of using autonomous vehicles are primarily standoff capability for the safety of the manned assets and secondarily, increased survey efficiency and coverage.  

Technical Requirements
•	Rapid Response – The vehicle must be capable of rapid deployment to a survey area through the use of civilian government transportation or commercial shipper.  Additionally, once on site the vehicle must be able to be assembled, programmed, and deployed within one hour
•	Vehicle Size Restrictions – The ideal autonomous vehicle, underwater or surface, would be capable of deployment from a small boat (less than 30 feet) with a three person crew.  A 500-pound rated davit is available, but no other specialized handling equipment can be permanently installed on the vessel (Portable handling devices are permissible.)
•	Survey Endurance – The vehicle must have an endurance of at least 8 survey hours at 5 knots without recharging, refueling, or reprogramming
•	Survey Modes – The vehicle must be able to operate in two modes:  fully autonomous and guided
•	Obstacle Avoidance – In either operating mode the preferred vehicle would have the ability to sense and avoid obstacles that are typical to port environment.
o	Optionally the obstacle avoidance system can incorporate an imaging sonar, such as a CodaOctopus Echoscope, Sound Metrics Didson, or Imagenex, that could be also used for target detection.
•	Navigation System – The vehicle’s navigation and positioning system must be self-contained and not require the deployment of additional buoy or land based systems.  Absolute horizontal positioning of the navigation system must be within 10 meters.
•	Survey Sensors – The primary survey sensor must be a hydrographic quality side-scan sonar equivalent to a Klein 5000 High-Speed, High-Resolution Side Scan Sonar system.
•	Sensor Data Format – The vehicle should produce a unified data file (e.g., XTF, SDF) that integrates universal time, vehicle navigation, and sensor data in a format compatible with Caris SIPS data processing software.
•	Target Detection and Positioning – The vehicle’s side scan sonar must be able to detect cubic features as small as 30 centimeters in water depths up to 50 meters with 10 meters horizontal position accuracy.
Training
•	Training on the operation and maintenance of the vehicle must be provided for up to five students at the vendor’s facilities
•	At a minimum the training must include:
o	Vehicle Setup
o	Mission Programming
o	Routine Maintenance

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Government intends to modify Firm Fixed Priced Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity contract W91CRB-05-D-0033 awarded on 27 September 2005 for Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder Systems (LLDR), associated spare parts and maintenance awar ded in support of Project Manager Soldier Equipment.  The minimum order quantity of the basic contract was 30 each LLDR systems, with a maximum order quantity of 390 each LLDR Systems over a three year period.  This modification will increase the maximum o rder quantity of this contract to 1,150 each LLDR systems.  The LLDR is a modular reduced size and weight targeting and designation system which operates day and night in all weather conditions. The design of the LLDR is proprietary to Litton Laser Systems  (2787 Orange Blossom Trail, P.O. Box 547300, Orlando, Fl. 32703-2010), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman Corporation.  The Government does not possess detailed technical data for this item.  No other source can provide an LLDR system that meet s the Government's requirements without duplication of development, test and manufacturing facility costs or without signficant delay in delivery of the LLDR systems. Offerors who can demonstrate they can meet the government's requirements will be consider ed for award.  No hard copy of the initial RFP was issued for this requirement. Only an electronic copy of the initial RFP W91CRB-05-R-0021 was issued on the Army Single Face to Industry web site.  Technical requirements of this proposed modification (refe rence W91CRB-06-R-0009), other than the increase in maximum order quantity under contract W91CRB-05-D-0033, remain unchanged from those identified under W91CRB-05-R-0021.  Accordingly, no formal RFP will be issued for this modification. Litton will be requ ested to submit a proposal for the proposed increase quantities.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has released Solicitation HM1572-06-R-0004 for Support to Management and Resources for Technical Services (SMARTS) Program on the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) web site.  NGA has a mission critical need for contractor provided support to management across a wide range of daily activities, and skilled resources for required technical operational services.  The SMARTS effort is for management support and other technical services including but not limited to web design services, speech writing services, management services, financial management services, and program and project support services.  These services provide indispensable program, project and office level support and in their aggregate, contribute to the efficient and effective execution of NGA corporate mission objectives.

This work will be performed principally at the NGA Washington, DC metropolitan area and St. Louis area locations, although support may be extended to NGA organizations globally.  Due to the sensitive nature of the work at NGA, all contractor personnel working in NGA facilities shall be required to be U.S. Citizens and have the appropriate Top-Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearance.  NGA encourages teaming arrangements.  Prospective companies will be required to provide a security plan as part of any proposal and must be capable of sustaining a sufficient cadre of cleared personnel to support NGA.   

NGA contemplates awarding one (1) Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract which will be set-aside for small business (restricted) and one (1) up to (3) IDIQ award(s) under full and open competition (unrestricted).  Six (6) task orders will be awarded simultaneously with the award of IDIQ contracts with two (2) of the initial task orders set-aside for small business.  After the initial IDIQ contract and task order award(s), future task orders will be competed between ALL SMARTS IDIQ holders.  The estimated IDIQ period of performance is from date of award through twelve (12) months, with four (4) option years (5 year total).  Individual task orders will typically include a twelve (12) month base period with four (4) option years.

<DESC>This modification is hereby issued to correct the spelling of "land" in the first sentence of the description and to correct email address listed within the description of the previous Sources Sought to read: beverly.j.williams@usmc.mil.  The below text is reprinted in its entirety. The United States Marine Corps (USMC) seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying a land mine clearing and proofing system.  The USMC proposes to evaluate, for near term lease or purchase, acceptable land mine clearance and proofing systems.  To accomplish this goal, the USMC has directed an Analysis of Alternatives study to be completed by a Government and Contractor Support Team led by the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Florida.  The study will assess the ability of candidate systems to perform the following: 1) Clearance of beach lanes and landing areas during amphibious assault operations; 2) Rapid airport runway clearance  (mines and unexploded ordnance); 3) Route clearance of improved and unimproved roads; 4) Area clearance; 5) Clearance of helicopter and/or vertical takeoff and landing aircraft landing zone; and 6) Proofing of cleared areas and routes. All interested parties who would like to include its mine clearance and proofing system in the USMC’s analysis must complete and return the attached System Questionnaire relating to the prioritized system criteria to Beverly Williams via email at beverly.j.williams@usmc.mil by 30 January 2006. Please include any brochures, test reports, assessments, or other documentation that will best illustrate your system’s capabilities. All material will be forwarded to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City for review.  Please ensure the completed questionnaire contains UNCLASSIFIED information only.  Your response will be fully protected and treated as proprietary, and will only be used to support the analysis. Information will be returned upon request.   This market research announcement should not be considered a commitment of any kind by the Government and individual correspondence should notbe expected in advance of any resulting pre-solicitation notice for the proposed requirements.  There will not be a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or any other solicitation issued in support of this analysis of alternatives.  This request should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award; the U.S. Government is not bound to make any awards or purchases under this request.  Submission of system information does not assure the company of a subsequent award.  NOTE:  If you are unable to retrieve the System Questionnaire, please email me at the above email address.  All technical questions must be sent via email.  If general questions, please feel free to contact me 703-784-0614.

The EMU will provide case consultation services to DOR regarding the unique medical, psychosocial, and employment support needs of the target population.

Specifically, contractor services required include (1) refining the final plan of the demonstration and evaluation; (2) conducting the demonstration in the California counties of Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Alameda; (3) recruiting current disability beneficiaries with a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, auto-immune and/or immune disorder to participate and dividing participants into a treatment group and a control group; (4) establishing an Expert Medical Unit (EMU) to provide consultation services to the contractor and DOR; (5) working with the EMU to identify an appropriate health plan for treatment group participants; and (6) performing a detailed evaluation of the demonstration and an analysis of its outcomes that will allow SSA to determine whether such services might produce positive work results for beneficiaries while providing long-term financial savings for SSA.

SSA anticipates awarding a cost-plus-fixed-fee type contract with an approximate 5-year period of performance.  The acquisition will be conducted using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541720 with a size standard of $6.5 million.

<RESPDATE>033106
<CONTACT>Technical POC: Mr. Brian Kaneen Phone 812-854-8701 All others: Mr. Scott Bingham Phone 812-854-8525
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. PURPOSE:  The Government is studying the usage of Bore-sight Training Aids (BTAs) for inclusion in the Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Kit.  This announcement is to conduct a Government Market Survey of commercially available BTA offerings and associated hardware.  This Market Survey has two objectives.  The first is to collect current cost, schedule, and performance information in order to place near-term small purchase orders for BTA subsystems and associated hardware.  The second objective of this Market Survey is to gather any additional data that vendors may supply that will enable the Government to develop a possible future specification/solicitation that could allow for larger BTA procurements. BACKGROUND:  The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) SOPMOD program provides small arms accessories to Army, Navy, and Air Force Special Forces Operators.  In 1993, USSOCOM arranged with the Naval Sea Systems Command to establish the SOPMOD Program Management Office at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Crane Division, at Crane, Indiana.  Since then, the SOPMOD Program has provided joint Special Operations Forces (SOF) with standardized, versatile weapons accessories to meet all needs across SOF mission scenarios.  These accessories increase SOF survivability and lethality by providing enhanced weapon performance, target acquisition, and day and night precision aiming.  The SOPMOD program provides these accessories to SOF operators when the accessories are developed to the point that they are operationally suitable, affordable, sustainable, and funded.  SOPMOD is an evolutionary acquisition program that continues to change and to upgrade its subsystems w!  ith new combat technologies. SOF Operators utilize multiple sighting accessories from the SOPMOD kit.  These accessories incorporate iron sights, laser sights, image intensification sights, thermal imaging sights, and optical (glass) riflescopes to provide SOF Operators with accurate aiming in day and night conditions.  Depending on the mission, the SOF Operator may be required to attach and detach several sighting accessories to the same weapon to configure the weapon for different mission profiles. Existing BTA’s in the government inventory exhibit characteristics that make them unsuitable for SOF applications.  While very accurate, the existing stock system items are expensive, bulky, complex, require inordinate amounts of training, are of limited utility in bright sunlight, and utilize mandrel rotation in the most critical accuracy area of the weapon bore, the last few inches before the muzzle of the barrel.  While this mandrel rotation has never been demonstrated to damage the barrel, a persistent SOF Operator perception that it could cause damage inhibits use of the system, particularly in sandy and dusty environments. In the past 5 years, SOF units and the SOPMOD Program have conducted user assessments with a variety of alternative Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) bore sight items.  These include small chamber bore sight lasers, simple mandrel optical collimators, and a magnetic optical collimator.  The SOPMOD program has a need for these types of items and other COTS BTA alternatives that provide simple and accurate confirmation of the alignment of installed aiming subsystems with the weapons bore-sight.  The potential future demand for BTAs has caused the SOPMOD Program to issue this Sources Sought announcement and consider a future competitive acquisition for BTAs and supporting hardware. REQUIREMENTS:  Training aids of this limited scope are not a combat subsystem, rather a training aid supplement Product Improvement Project (PIP) to the existing SOPMOD system.  As such, the BTA does not require a formal requirements document.  The fundamental training aid requirement is to provide small, inexpensive, easily transportable devices that can be quickly installed and removed from the weapon to provide a means of verifying the collimation of the point-of-impact/point-of-aim.  The devices should provide features that will make them useful during new weapons familiarization, initial sight installation, training exercises, and pre-combat activities. a.  Operational Concept:  During new weapons familiarization, the operator will use the BTAs to adjust the newly installed sighting devices for collimation with the bore axis.  During training exercises, the BTAs will provide modes of operation that will enable instructors to identify and correct problems such as sight alignment errors.  In preparation for combat, the BTAs will provide a means of final verification that weapon sights are zeroed. The BTAs are needed to allow the Operator to: (1) CONDUCT WEAPON ZERO WITH EFFICIENCY:  Rough zero sights on 25-meter training ranges with gross sight adjustments in order to rapidly hit the 25m Zero Target in the correct location, saving time and ammunition. (2) CONDUCT WEAPON ZERO VERIFICATION:  In base camp preparations prior to combat missions, the BTAs will provide a means of verifying collimation after changing sights or if it is suspected that the weapon and its assembled sighting subsystems have been disturbed or damaged.  The BTAs will determine if the Operator’s sights are “way off” in the field or in the forward support base.   (3) HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE BTAs:  Provide operator confidence that the BTAs are rugged enough to be used in training and combat preparations, that they add value to the deployment load, and that they are able to sustain anticipated misuse. b.  Technical Concept:  The BTAs may be in a variety of configurations for specific weapon needs.  They may be chamber laser bore sights, non-rotating mandrel collimators, magnetic collimators, or other unknown designs.  The BTAs should be capable of being consistently installed in a series of weapons.  While standardization is desirable, different BTAs may be required to cover the entire range of SOF weapons and aiming accessories.  Potential vendors should not be discouraged by the multiple weapons and aiming systems requiring BTAs, rather should consider providing information on one or more of the weapon/aiming accessory assemblies mentioned below.  The SOPMOD PMO, in an effort to broaden competition and reduce cost and schedule, may be willing to assist in certain technical aspects, such as the preparation of zeroing targets.  The following weapons/aiming systems are of interest in the BTA effort: Immediate client weapon BTA needs: M4A1 Carbine, (5.56mm NATO), NSN: 1005-01-382-0953 M24 and M82 Sniper Rifles, (7.62mm NATO), NSNs: Various  Mk11 Rifle, (7.62mm NATO), NSN: 1005-01-475-7980 MK12 Special Purpose Rifle (Series), (5.56mm NATO), NSNs: Various MK13 Series Sniper Rifle (.300 WinMag), NSN: 1005-LL-L99-5364 M240 MG (Series) (7.62mm NATO), NSNs: Various M249 MG (Series), (5.56mm NATO), NSNs: Various Mk46 LMG (5.56mm NATO), NSN: 1005-01-476-6236 Mk48 LMG (7.62mm NATO), NSN: 1005-01-497-0347 Possible future client weapon BTA needs: MK16 SCAR light (5.56mm NATO), NSN: (To be assigned) MK17 SCAR heavy (7.62mm NATO), NSN: (To be assigned) SOF Combat Pistol (.45 ACP), NSN: (To be assigned) MK14 Enhanced Battle Rifle (7.62mm NATO) M14 Rifle (7.62mm NATO), NSN: 1005-00-589-1271 M60 MG (7.62mm NATO), NSN: 1005-00-605-7710 Mk43 MG (7.62mm NATO), NSN: 1005-01-411-0224 Mossberg 500 Series Shotgun (12 gauge), NSN: 1005-01-371-4462 M2 .50 Caliber MG (.50 BMG), NSN: 1005-01-343-0747 M88 PIP .50 Caliber Sniper Rifle (.50 BMG), NSN: 1005-LL-L99-5798 Immediate aiming accessory BTA needs: Backup Iron Sight, NSN: 1005-01-449-6306 ACOG 4X Day Optical Scope, NSN: 1240-01-412-6608 AN/PEQ-2 Infrared Illuminator, NSN: 5855-01-422-5253 AN/PEQ-2A Infrared Illuminator, NSN: 5855-01-447-8992 AN/PEQ-5 Carbine Visible Laser, NSN: 5860-01-439-5409 AN/PVS-17A Miniature Night Vision Sight, NSN: 5855-01-474-8904 M68 CCOS and ECOS-N (Aimpoint Series), NSN: Various Future aiming accessory BTA needs: LA-5/PEQ, Illuminator, Integrated, Small Arms, NSN: 5855-01-533-0555 SU-230/PVS Articulated Telescope, NSN: 1240-01-533-0939 SU-231/PEQ Reflex Sight, NSN: 1240-01-533-0941 SU-232/PAS Thermal Sight, NSN: 5855-01-533-0557 INFORMATION REQUESTED:  The BTA kit(s) to be described are envisioned as a small re-usable waterproof container, containing one each of the proposed BTA product or assembly, supporting hardware, and a simple set of installation, zeroing, and operating instructions.  Interested vendors may provide information on one, more, or all of the host weapons/accessories of interest.   Interested vendors should submit the following information regarding the BTA kit(s): a.  Performance:  Please submit a technical description of the product, such as photographs, physical characteristics, operational features, and performance data.  This should consist of commercial product literature, operating instructions, and/or supplemental technical documentation that define the BTAs and associated hardware. b.  Schedule/Cost:  Please submit, as a minimum, the cost and delivery times for 1-100 each, 100-500 each, and 500-1000 each.  The Government may choose to act on this information in the near term with small purchase orders for testing, user assessments, urgent requirements, or other purposes. c. Future Designs:  Vendors are invited to submit cost, schedule, and performance information on planned future militarized designs or improvements to their current COTS products.  The government may use this data to develop a future solicitation/specification for BTAs. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP):  Currently, the government desires to procure the BTAs as COTS, or militarized versions of COTS products, and has no interest in the acquisition of vendor intellectual property.  The government, however, wishes to maintain open system architectures, and will have very limited interest in items that restrict future spiral development by using proprietary interfaces.  The SOPMOD Program does not have technical data packages for the weapons and sighting systems listed above.  Please do not request drawings or descriptions.  PARTICIPATION:  This announcement is a public invitation.  Vendors are requested to respond to one, more, or parts of the BTA Requirements.  Failure to participate in this Market Survey will not preclude abstaining vendors from bidding on possible future solicitations.  This announcement is part of the full-free-and-open competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape Government specifications to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to participate in this open dialog process may result in a future Government performance specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct early interaction with end-users, contracting officials, and acquisition planners. TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE RISK:  Small purchases of COTS BTAs could occur as soon as April 2006, when results of this Market Survey are received.  For larger BTA procurements, current program planning seeks to finalize the production and fielding of the BTA capability to combat units in a time frame relevant to ongoing hostilities.  The SOPMOD Program will have limited to no interest in basic research or initial applied research responses, or in early prototypical items, unless a clear, rapid path can be shown to achieve delivery of 15 first articles by the summer of 2006 for first article testing.  This schedule objective may be adjusted earlier or later depending on the schedule data collected from responding vendors.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. PURPOSE:  The Government is studying the usage of Weapon Quadrant Mounts (WQMs) for inclusion in the Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Kit.  This announcement is to conduct a Government Market Survey of commercially available WQM offerings and associated hardware.  This Market Survey has two objectives.  The first is to collect current cost, schedule, and performance information in order to place near-term small purchase orders for WQM subsystems and associated hardware.  The second objective of this Market Survey is to gather any additional data that vendors may supply that will enable the Government to develop a possible future specification/solicitation that could allow for larger WQM procurements. BACKGROUND:  The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) SOPMOD program provides small arms accessories to Army, Navy, and Air Force Special Forces Operators.  In 1993, USSOCOM arranged with the Naval Sea Systems Command to establish the SOPMOD Program Management Office at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Crane Division, at Crane, Indiana.  Since then, the SOPMOD Program has provided joint Special Operations Forces (SOF) with standardized, versatile weapons accessories to meet all needs across SOF mission scenarios.  These accessories increase SOF survivability and lethality by providing enhanced weapon performance, target acquisition, and day and night precision aiming.  The SOPMOD program provides these accessories to SOF operators when the accessories are developed to the point that they are operationally suitable, affordable, sustainable, and funded.  SOPMOD is an evolutionary acquisition program that continues to change and to upgrade its subsystems w!  ith new combat technologies. SOF Operators utilize multiple sighting accessories from the SOPMOD kit.  These accessories incorporate iron sights, laser sights, image intensification sights, thermal imaging sights, and optical (glass) riflescopes to provide SOF Operators with accurate aiming in day and night conditions.  Depending on the mission, the SOF Operator may be required to attach and detach several sighting accessories to the same weapon to configure the weapon for different mission profiles.  SOPMOD aiming systems are configured for direct line-of-sight, low angle fire, and are predominantly designed for 5.56 and 7.62 caliber small arms.  Certain SOPMOD Systems, however, are of utility on crew-served weapons of larger caliber, such as the M2 series .50 caliber and Mark 19 40mm machineguns.  These, and other SOF crew served weapons, require higher angles of fire.  Most current mounts in the US stock system inventory do not have the ability to incrementally incline direct line-of-sight sighting s!  ystems.  This forces the gunner to guess the elevation at longer ranges, leading to targets being missed, ammunition wasted, and less effective enemy engagement.  The US Army has developed quadrant mounts for the M2 and MK 19, however, these have not been tested for adaptability to SOPMOD Program subsystems and joint SOF missions, see ATTACHMENT # 1.   Recently, SOF units and the SOPMOD Program have conducted user assessments with a variety of alternative Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) quadrant sight items.  The SOPMOD program has a need for these types of items and other COTS WQM alternatives that provide simple and accurate range inclination of installed aiming subsystems.  The potential future demand for WQMs has caused the SOPMOD Program to issue this Sources Sought announcement and consider a future competitive acquisition for WQMs and supporting hardware. REQUIREMENTS:  The validated requirement for crew-served weapons capability in the SOPMOD Program and MDNS Development Project is found in ATTACHMENT # 2.   a.  Operational Concept:   (1)  SETUP:  The  SOF crew served weapons operator attaches the WQM to either the M2 50 caliber Machinegun or the MK 19.  The Operator attaches one or more in-line sighting systems to the WQM and zeros the sights to the weapon.  Ideally, the operator would be able to attach up to three separate sights on the WQM.  The WQM should have 1 (Thereshold), 3 (Objective) MILSTD 1913 rail surface(s) to accept various sights.  An objective sighting combination could be: (a) RAPID AIMING:  an Aimpoint™ series red dot sight, miniature red dot sight, or SU-231/PEQ Reflex Sight (b) NIGHT PASSIVE AIMING:  an AN/PVS-17 Mini Night Sight or SU-232/PAS Thermal Sight (c) ACTIVE AIMING: a day/night aiming laser, such as the AN/PEQ 11 or LA-5/PEQ  (2) FIND AND IDENTIFY TARGETS:  The operator uses night vision goggles or one of the attached weapon sights to detect and identify a long-range target.  The operator or an assistant determines the range to the target using a handheld rangefinder or other means.    (3) ENGAGE TARGETS:  The operator applies the correct range setting to the WQM, aims at the target and fires. b.  Technical Concept:  The WQMs may be in a variety of configurations for specific weapons/aiming system needs.  While standardization is desirable, different WQMs may be required to cover the entire range of SOF crew-served weapons and aiming accessories.  Potential vendors should not be discouraged by the multiple weapons and aiming systems requiring WQMs, rather should consider providing information on one or more of the weapon/aiming accessory assemblies mentioned below.  The SOPMOD PMO, in an effort to broaden competition and reduce cost and schedule, may be willing to assist in certain technical aspects, such as adaptation of COTs items to the geometries of the various sights, and the preparation of zeroing procedures and targets.  The following weapons/aiming systems are of interest in the WQM effort: Immediate client weapon WQM needs: M2, .50 Caliber MG (.50 BMG), NSN: 1005-01-343-0747 Other M2 series MGs, such as M2 HB, NSNs: 1005-00-122-9368 LH and                                     1005-00-122-9339 RH  MK 19 MOD 3, 40mm MG, NSN: 1010-01-126-9063 Possible future client weapon WQM needs: MK 47, 40mm MG (As an emergency backup system to the existing multi-mission sight) Immediate aiming accessory WQM needs: AN/PEQ-2 Infrared Illuminator, NSN: 5855-01-422-5253 AN/PEQ-2A Infrared Illuminator, NSN: 5855-01-447-8992 AN/PVS-17A Miniature Night Vision Sight, NSN: 5855-01-474-8904 M68 CCOS and ECOS-N (Aimpoint Series), NSN: Various Future aiming accessory WQM needs: AN/PEQ-11, Durable Aiming Illumination Laser, NSN: 5855-01-529-8714 LA-5/PEQ, Illuminator, Integrated, Small Arms, NSN: 5855-01-533-0555 SU-231/PEQ Reflex Sight, NSN: 1240-01-533-0941 SU-232/PAS Thermal Sight, NSN: 5855-01-533-0557 INFORMATION REQUESTED:  The WQM kit(s) to be described are envisioned as a sturdy cardboard or plastic container, containing one each of the proposed WQM product or assembly, supporting hardware, and a simple set of installation, zeroing, and operating instructions.  Interested vendors may provide information on one, more, or all of the host weapons/accessories of interest.   Interested vendors should submit the following information regarding the WQM kit(s): a.

<CONTACT>Connie Simmons, Contract Specialist, Phone 2023071995, Fax 2023071933, Email Connie.H.Simmons@usdoj.gov
<DESC>The Department of Justice is developing an acquisition strategy for its requirement for security improvements along the exterior perimeter of a building in the Washington, DC area.  As part of this process, we are seeking information about small businesses that are capable of performing the work.  Please note that this is a market survey for informational purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  There is no solicitation document available at this time; no contract will be awarded based on this announcement; no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement; and no telephone calls about this announcement will be accepted or acknowledged.  All responses must be submitted via e-mail in accordance with the instructions that follow.

Generally, the work covers the furnishing and installation of  specialized aluminum gates, fixed granite bollards and retractable steel bollards, power operated pedestrian gates, pedestrian turnstiles, railings, lighting, CCTV cameras, and guard booth transaction windows.  The aspect of the work that makes it different from exterior security improvements of a similar nature is that the building has many historically noteworthy features, and so construction work on the exterior is strictly regulated and must meet exacting standards. The estimated magnitude of the project is between $1 million and $5 million.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238210, with a small business size standard of $13.0 million.

Responses to this announcement must provide detailed, concise information about the company’s qualifications and experience in making exterior building security improvements similar to those described here at buildings considered historic, within the past five (5) years.  Responses shall include a list of up to five (5) such projects.  Project information shall include the contract number, dollar value, period of performance, current status, and current point of contact information including name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.  [Previous experience with historic buildings is important because our work requires protection of historical features; construction, removal, and reinstallation of historical features; and modification of existing historical features.]

In addition, the response must state small business size status (small; 8(a); small disadvantaged; HUBZone; service disabled, veteran owned; etc.) and not exceed 10 pages.  All responses must be submitted electronically to connie.h.simmons@usdoj.gov and be received no later than February 10, 2006 at 2:00 p.m., Eastern time.

<DESC>Training:
The Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Office of Antiterrorism Assistance (“DS/ATA”) manages the Department of State’s (“DoS”) antiterrorism assistance program primarily through training projects and related equipment grants.  This program requires support in furtherance of its specialized foreign assistance mission.  The contractor will support DS/ATA in conducting foreign law enforcement training and related activities, both domestically and overseas. The customer for these training services is DS/ATA; however, the actual recipient of these training services will be selected foreign police and security officials.  The scope of training services requested ranges from police tactical training and specialized consultations to senior executive crisis management seminars, including many knowledge-based and skills-based disciplines necessary for an effective antiterrorism capability. This is an advanced training program, and demonstrable training experience in the delivery of counterterrorism/antiterrorism skills with specialized law enforcement and security strategies, tactics, techniques, and procedures is the most important factor for contract manpower selections. 

The specific training will be conducted at any location worldwide specified by the Government, according to individual Task Orders, including remote training sites.  “Country clearance” granted by the U.S. Ambassador to a country receiving a training program abroad will be the sole standard establishing the adequacy of security for the Contractor’s personnel to conduct a tasked mission.

The Contractor will:  provide all instructional services required and tasked to develop, update, maintain, and/or present courses; prepare for and deploy instructional teams on training missions; provide training aids, training devices, and support equipment and supplies; and perform other tasks as identified in this SOW.  The actual delivery of training courses and related services requiring Contractor support will be specified in individual Task Orders.  The Contractor will follow the approved schedule and program of instruction of training, as directed.  No deviations from the schedule and program of instruction are permitted by the Contractor without the advance, written permission of the Government.  

The Contractor will provide support in the following general categories:  Program Management: including all administration, logistics, planning, scheduling, delivery, and development and updating, related to presentation of tasked instruction; Instruction:  including training instructors and developers as specified. 

The Contractor will provide the necessary qualified personnel who possess the Government-specified experience and training required for performance described herein.  This will include managerial, educational, and technical personnel.  

The Contractor will provide at the training site all equipment and supplies necessary to conduct tasked training in accordance with Government-provided lists.  The Government reserves the right to stipulate on individual Task Orders that it will provide selected items on those lists at its discretion.

The Contractor will provide precise translation services of curriculum materials, in accordance with individual Task Orders.  The Contractor will arrange the translation services based upon an evaluation of both the technical competence of the translating entity and the competitiveness of the associated costs.  Prior to expenditure of funds for translation services, the Contractor will provide the details of initial and subsequent evaluations to the Government, who may direct further market research when required in his judgment is in the interests of the Government.

Facilities:
In support of the above described training, when said training will take place in the continental United States (domestic), DoS/DS/ATA requires that the Contractor also provide a training site(s) with extensive facilities for conducting year-around classroom and outdoor training for foreign law enforcement and security personnel. The students to be trained will be from a wide spectrum of ranks and job assignments and from varying cultures and nationalities.

The requirement includes management, administrative, logistical and technical support, classrooms to accommodate up to 32 persons each, living quarters, messing facilities for up to 100 persons, recreational facilities, and outdoor ranges for assault rifle, pistol, shotgun and submachine gun instruction and firing practice. Rappelling facilities, a shooting house, high-speed driving track, and safe areas for the detonation of explosive charges, and local transportation support are also needed.

As many as three classes of approximately 24 students each may be scheduled concurrently, and, changes in program schedules as well as additions and cancellations to the rosters, can be expected. Therefore, the numbers of students and the schedules for training will fluctuate, often on short notice.

All students will be foreign law enforcement or security personnel and most will not speak English. Escorts and interpreters will be provided for all student groups by the Government. The Recipient will furnish facilities, the support personnel needed for their operation and maintenance, and the other resources needed to meet the requirements of the contract.
The Government anticipates that its requirement will be for up to 30 domestic courses a year and up to 200 overseas courses a year.

Place of Contract Performance:
Worldwide:  In the continental United States the subject training services, related activities and facilities will be required, whereas thorughout the rest of the world only the training services and related activities will be required as the Government will provide the facilities.

Submission Instructions:
We request that interested and qualified businesses submit capability statements (electronic submissions are welcome) to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Tracy R. Ford, fordtr@state.gov, within seven business days of the release of this announcement.  Capability statements must describe the company’s ability to attract and retain required instructional personnel, as well as key management personnel who must qualify for Secret Clearances.  Contractor will not be required to maintain or store any classified information at his location.  Capability statements should include relevant past performance information.  Based on the above summary description of contract requirements, companies are encouraged to suggest to the Government the most appropriate and useful contract type.  At this time the Government is considering an RFP that will result in the award of a single IDIQ contract(with a base year and four (4) option years.)

<SUBJECT>A -- MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIALS OF NOVEL ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEPATITIS C WHO HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY RESPONDED TO STANDARD THERAPY
<DESC>Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration

MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIALS OF NOVEL ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEPATITIS C WHO HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY RESPONDED TO STANDARD THERAPY

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks collaborations with Industry to provide novel antiviral agents including protease inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors with activity against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) to study important issues regarding their use in patients with advanced liver disease who have not responded to previous therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin.  The agent(s) selected would be tested in an existing cohort of patients participating in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial, an NIH-sponsored multi-center clinical trial.  Information on HALT-C, including citations on the trial design and early results, can be found at www.haltctrial.org/. 

INTRODUCTION:  The HALT-C Trial is a multi-center, randomized controlled study designed to determine if continuing interferon long term over several years will suppress the Hepatitis C virus, prevent progression to cirrhosis, prevent liver cancer and reduce the need for liver transplantation.  This prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial is studying long-term therapy with peginterferon in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Patient enrollment began in 2000 and was completed in 2003.  Patients with chronic hepatitis C and cirrhosis (Ishak fibrosis stage 5 or 6 on a scale of 0 to 6) or bridging fibrosis (Ishak fibrosis stage 3 or 4) on liver biopsy who have failed to respond to a previous course of interferon alfa were enrolled in this study. Before being randomized it was established that patients were unable to obtain a sustained virological response using the best available therapy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin.  A total of 1050 patients were randomized to receive maintenance, low-dose pegylated interferon or to be followed on no treatment.  Liver biopsies were done before enrollment and after 2 and 4 years of treatment or follow-up.  Study endpoints for patients with cirrhosis are the clinical outcomes of hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, death, or liver transplantation and for patients with bridging fibrosis the development of cirrhosis or a clinical outcome.  Interim trial results are not available to the investigators, but have been monitored by and independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board.  Final results from the trial are expected by mid-2007.  All patients are being followed in a standardized fashion with regular assessment of the liver disease, viral levels, and evidence for hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma. Numerous ancillary studies, including evaluation of fibrosis markers, quantitative tests of hepatic function, markers for hepatocellular carcinoma, immunological features of disease and virology, are currently funded.  Serum samples, DNA cell lines, and liver tissues are stored at NIDDK repositories.

The HALT-C principal investigators wish to consider potential new therapeutics for use in this well–characterized, treatment-resistant patient population once they have completed the current randomized trial.

STUDY GOALS:  The overall goal of these follow-up studies will be to test new therapeutics to evaluate their efficacy in eliminating or suppressing the Hepatitis C virus and preventing the progression of liver disease. 

Ancillary studies to evaluate the mechanisms of action, mechanisms of antiviral resistance and measures of improvement in liver structure and function also pose opportunities for collaborators.

REQUIREMENTS FOR SELECTION:  Potential industry collaborators should be in the process of developing novel antiviral agents against hepatitis C.  Such agents should have already been tested or are currently being tested in Phase I trials in humans.  Potential collaborators should submit a brief capability statement to the contact person noted below.

CAPABILITY STATEMENT:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed three (3) pages of narrative and should address the following selection criteria:  (1) Name(s) of the antiviral agents in development and their proposed mechanisms of action; (2) The stage of clinical investigation with these agents, including whether phase I, IIa, IIb, and III trials are completed or underway; and (3) Suggestions of studies that might be carried out with the agent(s) in the patient population described above.  Supporting documentation may be included in Appendices to the Statement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate.  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration.  The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA.

SUBMISSION DATES:  Only written capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before February 22, 2006, will be considered.  Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement may be invited at the Applicants’ own expense to discuss with the HALT-C Steering Committee their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the HALT-C Steering Committee on March 9, 2006, in Washington, D.C.

The U.S. Department of State, U.S. Embassy Guatemala Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) has a requirement for rotary air (helicopter) charter services to various locations within Guatemala on an as needed basis to support the NAS counter narcotic interdiction and eradication missions.

The requirement is for an indefinite number of flights which the proposed contractor may be required to coordinate in as short a timeframe as 12-24 hours from a request. All flying is strictly during daylight hours and may range from 3 to 6 hours per mission depending on the mission. The requests may be during non-business hours (i.e. weekends, after hours or holidays). The government anticipates awarding an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with a base period of one-year from date of award and four one-year option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the government. During the term of the contract, which includes the base year and all option years exercised, the government shall order, as a minimum, services in an amount of at least $10,000.00 USD and the maximum cumulative amount of the Task Orders issued during a single year will not exceed $1,000.00. The maximum dollar value for the life of the contract will be $125,000.00 which includes the base year and all options.
