Your firm must be willing and able to work on all the projects that may occur within the geographical area of the award.  The contract is a unit price standard type arrangement for a one year base term with potentially four 1-year renewal options.    The initial contract amount is anticipated to be $1,000,000.

The Western Montana Acquisition Zone antcipates a Request for Quote for forest wide trail maintenance for the USDA Forest Service, Bitterroot National Forest.  
The Contractor shall provide all expertise, labor, supervision, services, equipment, mobilization, tools, supplies (i.e., water, etc.), permits, licenses, transportation, and incidentals necessary to perform trail maintenance on OHV and single track trails (wilderness and non-wilderness).
The work involves logging out the trail clearing limits of downed or leaning trees; removing loose rocks and woody debris that have entered the trail tread; and cleaning all existing drainage facilities (to original design) since the last maintenance period . No brushing or blasting is required.  OHV trail drainage structures will require considerably more work than single track structures. Government estimates of time are 15-30 minutes per OHV drainage structure. There are approximately 50 structures per mile. These estimates are made using basic hand tools. Tread widths may vary from 50” maximum width on TR# 39 & 313 – Chain of Lakes & Bitterroot-Rock Divide, to 64” maximum width on TR# 182, 185 & 248 – Taylor Creek, Jew Mtn & Drop Creek. 
Past trailway maintenance practice has used chainsaws (on trails NOT in wilderness), crosscut saws (on trails in wilderness) and various hand tools to effectively perform this type of work.
The terrain is characterized by very steep and deeply dissected topography.  Conditions on the trails will vary widely in regard to amount of blowdown, rocks, and grade. Weather conditions in this area are unpredictable and may include thunder, lightning storms, and wind.  These conditions are already accommodated in the delivery schedule.

This solicitation will be solicited under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). No site visit is scheduled for this project.  For further information, please contact Nick Hazelbaker at the West Fork Ranger Station at 406-821-3269.  The solicitation will be issued approximately April 23, 2009.  Estimated start date is June 15, 2009.

<DESC>Introduction

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has a requirement to establish a central repository that will provide one-stop shopping for research materials for the broad community of microbiology and infectious diseases researchers. The repository will receive, acquire, authenticate, produce, preserve, store and distribute most of the approximately 15,000 unique organisms and reagents needed to comprise the comprehensive collection. It will also distribute materials produced by other research service programs and Government-supported research projects.
Description 

Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by all infectious agents other than HIV, including research to counter bioterrorism. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics that is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  

Toward this aim, DMID supports an array of research services. Included are programs that make preclinical and clinical translational research services, as well as organisms and state-of the art reagents, DNA sequencing, data and analytic tools, and biocontainment and core facilities, available to investigators (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid/). For the most part, these services are currently provided through multiple, specialized programs. DMID seeks now, however, to adopt an integrated approach to the provision of services by creating unified, comprehensive, coordinated programs. This strategy is being employed to: advance science by promoting cross-fertilization across and within disciplines and approaches; serve the research community more conveniently; achieve efficient use of resources through economy of scale and avoidance of duplication; and provide the flexibility needed to respond to changing priorities.

Accordingly, DMID is establishing the Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Biological Research Resources Program (hereinafter called the Biological Research Resources Program). The Biological Research Resources Program will integrate and consolidate the functions currently carried out by numerous NIAID-supported repositories (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid/repos.htm). Of these currently supported programs, five concentrate on targeted groups of bacteria (Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, resistant staphylococci, respiratory pathogens, and mycobacteria responsible for tuberculosis and leprosy); one is dedicated to emerging viruses and arboviruses; one focuses on Aspergillus species; and three are dedicated to individual parasites (filarial worms, schistosomes, and plasmodia). Another program focuses on NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/CatA.htm). This program provides a comprehensive collection of research materials, including those deposited by other Government-supported research projects, to be made available to the biodefense and emerging infectious disease scientific communities.  Together, these collections contain approximately 15,000 unique catalog items and more than a half million units for distribution.

The Biological Research Resources Program is designed not only to meet the currently defined needs of scientific communities, but also to meet emerging needs for research materials as they are identified. The Biological Research Resources Program comprises multiple components. The Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Biological Resources Repository (MID-BRR) will serve as a central repository that will provide one-stop shopping for the broad community of microbiology and infectious diseases researchers. The MID-BRR will receive, acquire, authenticate, produce, preserve, store and distribute most of the organisms and reagents needed to comprise the comprehensive collection. 

A separate and complementary Request for Proposal (RFP) has been solicited for the Animal Models of Infectious Diseases program, which will provide the capacity to ensure a supply for the MID-BRR of organisms that must be grown in animals as well as reagents integral to research on these organisms. The Animal Models of Infectious Diseases program will work closely with the MID-BRR. 

The MID-BRR will also serve as a repository for research materials produced by other Government-supported research projects and research service programs. The MID-BRR Contractor is expected to interact with these programs as well.

 
For the purposes of this contract, research materials include both organisms and reagents:

•	Organisms include, for example, bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi, including NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/CatA.htm) and NIAID designated emerging infectious disease agents or organisms (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/emerging/list.htm).

•	Reagents include, for example, biochemical, biologic, cellular, genomic, immunologic and molecular specimens and/or resources integral to research on these organisms.  Reagents may also refer to toxins and other agents such as prions; to antiviral and anti-infective drugs and therapeutics, chemicals, agents that modulate the immune system, vaccines, vaccine constructs and vaccine adjuvants, and diagnostic tools and kits for detection and measurement.

It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement-type contract will be awarded on or about March 31, 2010, for a Base Period of one year plus Options to Extend the Term for up to six additional one-year periods (through March 30, 2017). In addition, the contract will include Options to Increase the Level-of-Effort in increments that may increase the total level-of-effort by a maximum of 28 FTEs per year.

A total level of effort of 56 FTEs per year (116,480 total direct labor hours per year based on a Work Year of 2080 hours) for a period of performance of seven years (Base period plus six, one-year Options) is required.  In addition, during any year of the contract, contractors must also be able to respond to requests to provide additional effort based on the exercise of Options in increments of 2 FTEs, 5 FTEs or 10 FTEs, up to a maximum of 28 FTEs per year.  Contractors must provide, for example, the following labor mix:

Professional Support:  Project/Program Manager(s), Director(s) of Collections, Director(s) of Science
Technicians and Support:  Technical Manager(s), Collection Scientist(s), Regulatory Specialist(s), Compliance Director(s), Marketing Manager(s), Field Acquisition Specialist(s), Technical Writer(s), Biologist(s)
Non-Professional Support:  Operations Technician(s), Quality Systems Technician(s), Technical Service Representative(s), Customer Support staff(s), Clerical

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Agency.  This RFP will be available electronically on/about April 23, 2009, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fbo.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>RECOVERY-THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER NAVAIR BOA N00019-09-G-0009.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a sole-source, cost plus fixed fee Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) task order to General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) under N00019-09-G-0009.  The requirement is to test and qualify bio-fuel blends for the GEAE F414-GE-400.  The GEAE F414-GE-400 engine, installed on the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft, will be the first to be certified to use a blend of bio-fuel with JP-5 fuel.  Certification shall be demonstrated through ground engine tests and rig tests, as required.  The effort shall determine that the F414-GE-400 engine will operate and meet all applicable specification requirements at Sea Level Static (SLS) conditions safely and effectively using the bio-fuel/JP-5 blend.  Certification shall be provided no later than 31 January 2010. The contractor shall also provide F414-GE-400 engineering support during flight tests at NAS Patuxent River.  The contractor shall conduct such tests and analyses as may be necessary to determine that F414-GE-400 engine operation with the bio-fuel/JP-5 mixture will not result in degradation or malfunction of fuel-powered or fuel-whetted engine components.  The contractor shall also provide a general protocol for certifying all engines of their manufacture (both currently in Navy service and in the acquisition process) for operation with the bio-fuel/JP-5 blend.  A final report, certifying that the bio-fuel/ JP-5 blend is acceptable for use in the F414-GE-400 aircraft engine, shall be provided by 30 September 2010.   Certification of the F414-GE-400 engine to use biofuel conducted under this effort will serve as partial supporting  flight clearance data.  The effort shall be awarded as a cost plus fixed fee order due to the research and development nature of the fuel certification process.  This award is based on Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), whereby the supplies or services required are available from only one source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  GEAE is the sole designer, developer, and integrator of the above engine and is uniquely qualified to provide the complete range of program support required by the Fleet.  GEAE is the only known firm that possesses the technical data necessary to fulfill the Government’s requirements.  Points of contact for this announcement are: Contract Specialist Karen Johnston at (301)757-4224, karen.johnston@navy.mil and Contracting Officer Damon McGill at (301)757-7063, damon.mcgill@navy.mil.

MANUFACTURING CALIBRATION TEST BLOCKS
 FOR
SHEARWAVE ULTRASONIC TESTING OF HP FLASKS
1. NAVFACEMGCOM plans on establishing an inventory of calibration blocks to be used for shear wave testing of their high pressure flasks used in diving and hyperbaric systems.  We have purchased flask material from CPI Industries for each of the flask types and rated pressures.  A set (one axial and one circumferential) of calibration blocks would be produced for each flask type and rated pressure.  Attached are further details showing; an example set of cal blocks and ASME block specification.  This attached spec provides a square notch depth range that can be applied to the MIL-STD and DOT blocks.  The existing flask rings (each one and half inch width) would be shipped at government expense to your facility.  Each finished set of stamped cal blocks would include a heavy duty storage and shipping container, and support certification documentation for distribution by our office to field locations for flask inspection testing.
2. The qualified manufacturer shall cut, machine, stamp each calibration block as identified below and ship the finished blocks and remaining raw flask material to our Ocean Construction Support Facility at Saint Julian's Creek in Portsmouth, Virginia.  The OCSF point of contact is Jamie Kelly at (757)485-6403.
a) one set - MIL-F-22606C Class 3000 18"OD x .561" min wall
b) one set - MIL-F-22606C Class 3000 18"OD x .933" min wall
c) two sets - ASME SF 3 & 4 18"OD x .764" min wall (3232 psi MAWP)
d) two sets - ASME SF 3 & 4 20"OD x 1.303"minwall (5500 psi MAWP)
e) one set - DOT-3AA-2400 24"OD x .584" min wall (2400 psi MAWP)
3. The manufacturer shall be experienced in making standard test blocks using electrical discharge machining (EDM) for the Non-Destructive Examination (NDE) industry in support of examination procedures specified in American Society of Mechanical Engineers, American Society of Testing and Materials, National Institute of Standards and Testing and Military Standards 271 and 278.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 562211   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(!), with Stericylce, Inc., for the removal of Biological/Infectious waste from two (2) US EPAfacilities in Cincinnati, OH.  The US EPA intends to issue a threee (3) year Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for these services.  The anticipated number of pick-ups is approximately 26 to 30 per year.  The contractor shall provide approximately 16 standard size (approximately 5 or 6 cubic feet) boxes with the liners to be used to package biological/infectious waste.  The boxes shall be marked in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and local regulations.  The contractor shall be properly permitted and authorized by the appropriate regulatory agency (i.e., EPA, DOT) to transport, handle, and destroy infectious waste and must transport, handle, and destroy infectious waste in accordance with all Federal, State, and local regulations and shall return to the EPA Project Officer a completed manifest for each shipment within four weeks of the shipment date.US EPA requires a contractor that possesses the unique capabilities of being specifically licensed and/or permitted by EPA and all other applicable regulatory agencies (i.e. Department of Transportation, etc.) for removal transport and destruction/treatment (incineration) of infectious waste.  Furthermore, a local company is required because of the nature of the waste (biological in nature) and the frequency of pick-ups required.  This unique capability is essential for contract performance because it is a legal requirement based on regulation of these services.

POSITION DESCRIPTION:  HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADVISOR, USAID/ETHIOPIA

A.  BACKGROUND

USAID/Ethiopia’s Health, AIDS, Population and Nutrition (HAPN) Team implements programs in health, with HIV/AIDS constituting the largest portion of the health program, at over $200 million for FY 2008/9.  The health portfolio covers child survival (immunization, Integrated Management of Childhood illnesses, nutrition), reproductive health (family planning, safe motherhood), and infectious diseases (tuberculosis, malaria).  HIV/AIDS activities are implemented through the President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which includes programs in primary prevention of HIV, Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT), Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC), palliative care, antiretroviral Treatment (ART), HIV/AIDS counseling and testing (HCT), and other care and support programs.  USAID’s malaria activities are implemented with funding from the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) in the areas of Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs), Intermittent Presumptive Treatment (IPT) and case management using artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT).

Along with the GFATM, PEPFAR/Ethiopia is by far the largest donor for HIV/AIDS programs in the country, and around 60% of the total PEPFAR budget is managed by USAID.  Supply chain activities managed by USAID include the single largest agreement in the PEPFAR portfolio. USAID’s health program in Ethiopia is also substantial, with the agency again well placed as one of the largest donors.  The largest proportion of USAID/Ethiopia health sector funding, over $120 million in fiscal year 2008/9, is provided through PEPFAR. This multi-agency program is implemented under the leadership of the U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia, and is guided by a national Executive Committee.  The USG PEPFAR team maintains close links to Ethiopia’s national AIDS coordination structures within the MOH, in particular the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Office (HAPCO) and the Programming and Planning Department (PPD), as well as other key line Ministries including the Ministries of Education; Youth and Sports; and Women and Social Affairs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Center for Delivery,
Organization and Markets, through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Pam Owen Ph.D., 21 Granada Way, St. Louis, MO. 63124.  The anticipated date of award is April 24, 2009.
 
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is the lead Federal Agency that conducts health services research, which spans cost, quality, access, and outcomes of care studies.  

AHRQ provides data resources and evidence focusing on the quality of care in the hospital outpatient setting through the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). Recently States have begun to provide data on Emergency Department (ED) encounters to HCUP and have also provided the E-codes which allow the cause of accidents to be determined. This makes HCUP, particularly the newly developed Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), the ideal resource for studying injurious falls nationally with a focus on resource use, efficiency, and costs.  

The purpose of this contract is to obtain expert knowledge in using AHRQ’s HCUP data to analyze injurious falls among elderly living in the community.  This project will collect information on the extent, nature, and cost of the injurious falls.  It will identify patterns of ED and hospital use in the treatment of injurious falls, and generate estimates of hospital costs, cause and severity of injury, hospital readmissions, and the use of ambulatory surgery.  Subsequently, this project will examine the impact of State accident prevention programs.

The contractor is unique based on her expertise and facility in using and disseminating hospital and emergency department outpatient data. As a result of her institutional knowledge gained in performing similar work. The contractors’ existing mastery of outpatient data and analytic data skills provide expedited manner in completing the project.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

For further information, please contact Nora Tyson in Rm. 5C-03, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857 or on 301-443-5229.

<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA),
Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to District of Columbia, Department of Mental Health, 51 N Street, N.E., 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20002.  The anticipated date of award is April 28, 2009.

The DC Primary Care Association (DCPCA) recently addressed this issue in “Slipping Through the Cracks: Closing the Gaps in the District’s Mental Health System,” a report which highlighted the fact that while patients requiring mental health care for primary psychiatric conditions may receive care through publicly funded mental health services, that patients seen primarily in primary care clinics, often with undetected mental health disorders, cannot access appropriate care for these conditions. Importantly, while the District does fund primary health care for uninsured patients through the DC Alliance program, funding for mental health services is limited and largely focuses on those individuals who have a more significant psychiatric disturbance. As a result, most patients in the District of Columbia have not had access to practices that have implemented the integrated approach now the standard of care recommended by the Institute of Medicine and other federal experts; the goal of the proposed project is to develop the plans necessary to close this gap in the availability of essential mental health services in the District.  

The specific objective of this project is to develop a sustainable, district-wide partnership between DMH and the District’s safety-net primary care clinics to provide needed mental health services to low-income residents and to help our mental health providers link up with primary health care settings.

All materials produced under this project shall be the property of the Federal government, which includes the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  Any publication of research findings derived from work related to this contract shall prominently identify the financial support and partnership of CMHS and of SAMHSA in its development.  SAMHSA or CMHS may utilize, print, or disseminate all such materials without further charge.  No articles or publications which rely substantially on materials produced under this project shall be published by either party without prior consultation and approval.

The District of Columbia Department of Mental Health is uniquely positioned to take the lead on integrating primary health care and mental health care.  As the mental health authority for the District of Columbia the Department of Mental Health (DMH) has begun a process with the DCPCA and experts from Georgetown University Department of Psychiatry to integrate mental health and primary health.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed price contract modification to General Dynamics C4 Systems (GDC4S), 8201 East McDowell Road, Scottsdale, Arizona 85252-1417 on a sole source basis.  The requirement is to procure the integration of 21 Generator, Environmental Control Unit (ECU), and Trailer (GETs), initial spares, consumables, and training that meets the Marine Corps’ need for an integrated power and environmental control subsystem solution for the Unit Operations Center (UOC).  GDC4S is the original equipment manufacturer and integrator for UOC System under contract number M67854-02-C-2052 and integrates the components of the GET into an effective subsystem.  GDC4S will be responsible for all aspects of system performance in stand-alone mode and as an integrated component into the digital UOC.  Although components are provided by subcontractors, GDC4S has developed the expertise to assemble the components into the appropriate!  configuration.    GDC4S is the only company able to provide the total integration process, no other firm has the technical knowledge, special tooling and test equipment, and familiarity to perform the tasks mentioned above without incurring significant additional non-recurring cost and schedule impact to the Marine Corps.  The Marine Corps does not possess the drawing package or other engineering data associated with the equipment to support competition for the integration and associated training for these componenets. The UOC GET solution provided under this contract meets the Marine Corps requirements for power and ECU weight, on an Army certified and supported trailer designed to carry gear associated with the UOC including tents of specific size and weight, supporting ducts, and cables.   No request for proposal is available for competitive bidding.  However, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement.  All comm! unications shall be in writing.  Proprietary information shall be clearly identified as such and will be protected.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC><p>Sources Sought -Technical, Logistical and Administrative Services in Maputo, Mozambique<br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). IT IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY AWARD A CONTRACT. ANY COST INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THIS<br />ANNOUNCEMENT SHALL BE BORNE BY THE INTERESTED PARTY (PROSPECTIVE OFFEROR) AND WILL NOT BE CHARGED TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR REIMBURSEMENT. This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of interested, capable and qualified businesses and agencies that can provide international Technical, Logistical and Administrative Services, to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Maputo, Mozambique. <br />Under the direction of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator's Office (OGAC), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Global AIDS Program (GAP) is a partner in the unified U.S. Government (USG) effort to implement the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR/Emergency Plan). On July 30, 2008, President George W. Bush signed into law the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act (H.R. 5501), extending PEPFAR for five more years. In this legislation, Congress underscored its confidence in PEPFAR by dramatically increasing funding to up to $48 Billion, more than tripling original funding. The 10-year program goals for PEPFAR include: treatment for at least 3 million people, the prevention of 12 million new infections, and care for 12 million people, including 5 million orphans and vulnerable children. Since 2000, GAP has helped resource-constrained countries prevent HIV infection; improve treatment, care, and support for people living with HIV; and build capacity and infrastructure to address the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.
<p>To help meet the goals of the Emergency Plan, GAP has assigned over 100 CDC staff to the field and employed over 1,000 local staff to implement country programs. CDC established a field office in Mozambique in 2000. Mozambique was one of the15 Emergency Plan focus countries under PEPFAR I. Mozambique GAP staff provides expertise in the areas of HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment, infrastructure development, laboratory capacity building, monitoring and evaluation, surveillance, and public health evaluation research.</p>
<p>Members of GAP Mozambique Epidemiology and Strategic Information team develop and maintain HIV-related information and reporting systems, monitor and evaluate HIV/ AIDS prevention, care, and treatment initiatives, strengthen in-country capacity to conduct HIV/AIDS surveillance, and perform epidemiologic investigations.</p>
<p>Strategic information (SI) is comprised of program monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) and surveillance supported by the appropriate health management information systems (HMIS). SI is used as a tool for synthesizing relevant information from multiple sources to assist with strategic planning, program improvement, accountability, and sharing with key stakeholders. SI programs will serve the Government of Mozambique in planning and monitoring their HIV/AIDS activities, advocating for continued support of HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment programs, coordinating efforts of the international donor community, providing information to the USG (OGAC) for managing PEPFAR, and demonstrating progress of PEPFAR in the annual report to the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>In previous years, all administrative and logistical support for in-country surveys, including surveillance systems, had been done through the General Services Office (GSO). The volume of these purchase orders (PO) has increased drastically in the last year and these POs have become increasingly complex and complicated to award through the GSO. We anticipate the work load to further increase in FY09 as described below.<br /><br />The Ministry of Health (MOH), with technical assistance (TA) from the CDC, is currently working on the implementation of several surveys, and surveillance activities. Currently, the MOH with assistance from its partners have 17 surveys in progress , and the PEPFAR team has applied for 8 multi country public health evaluations (PHEs), and 3 Mozambique specific PHEs.</p>
<p>The Mozambique program needs a flexible and speedy mechanism that will enable the USG to help the MOH implement the above mentioned surveys and PHEs in a timely fashion. To assist with the technical, logistical and administrative support for Mozambique's multiple strategic information activities, CDC GAP Mozambique is developing a new competitive contract. The purpose of this contract is to provide technical, logistical and administrative assistance and support for CDC-funded global HIV/AIDS activities and programs with respect to surveillance, monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E), and HMIS.</p>
<p>Specific task orders under this contract will consist of a) assessing and analyzing the performance of SI teams, projects, and systems supported by CDC's GAP in Mozambique, b) providing technical, logistical and/or administrative assistance for CDC-funded surveys and other activities, c) providing capacity building, technical assistance, and other administrative assistance for other CDC-funded global HIV program evaluations, d) providing translation services, as needed, in the context of survey instrument development, survey implementation, and report development. The results of these activities will be used to a) assist GAP Mozambique -supported programs in planning and monitoring their HIV/AIDS activities, b) advocate for continued improvement of HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment programs, and c) provide information to OGAC for coordinating and managing PEPFAR.<br />Attached is the Draft Performance Work Statement. <br />Other Information:<br />The CDC is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from qualified businesses and agencies. Agencies qualified to do business with the United States Government (USG) shall be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and not on the debarred list. They shall have the capability to provide the above referenced support services. <br />Currently the Government is only performing preliminary research to determine the availability of interested, capable and qualified businesses and agencies that can provide domestic Professional support services to international activities within the CDC at multiple locations and offices and the type of teaming arrangements a company participated in.<br />SOC Submission Requirements:<br />The Statement of Capabilities (SOC) shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact and phone/fax/email. Provide no more than two examples with types of contracts and dollar value of any teaming arrangements in which your company has managed and/or participated in for works similar in nature to this sources sought.<br />The NAICS code for this requirement is 541690.

<DESC>1. BackgroundNASAs Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) Project within NASAs Aviation SafetyProgram (see IRAC Technical Plan, located at:http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/nra_pdf/irac_tech_plan_c1.pdf	 ) has a long-termresearch plan to advance the state of aircraft flight control to provide onboard controlresilience for ensuring safe flight in the presence of adverse conditions. One of theproject objectives is to advance the state-of-the-art of adaptive controls to the pointof maintaining stable flight in degraded or upset conditions, and sustain safe flightthrough landing. To this end, NASA has access to a modified F/A-18 full-scale, pilotedaircraft with high performance capabilities for IRAC integrated system-level researchexperiments. NASA also has access to a family of remotely piloted subscale transportaircraft that will be used to augment the full-scale flight research as appropriate. (SeeAppendix A in the attachment for the capabilities of these flight assets.) As NASA doesnot typically build or certify military or commercial aircraft, we will considerpartnerships with industry to help us identify emerging safety concerns and advance thetechnologies to continually improve aircraft safety. Towards this goal, the project is soliciting information and feedback from the aviationcommunity. At this time, NASA will use any information provided for the purpose ofconsidering a focused research effort in this area and will publish a summary of thecollected responses from this solicitation. This synopsis is for information and planningpurposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will theGovernment pay for information solicited. 2. Description Under this request for information (RFI), NASA seeks to identify technologyimplementation barriers to implementation of adaptive control technologies andarchitectures. Responses will inform the IRAC project as it defines an experimentalflight test program for maturing the technology readiness of adaptive controltechnologies and architectures for their use in the next generation civilian transportairplanes. Specifically, IRAC seeks community input into implementation barriers to implementingadaptive control on production civilian aircraft, and how those barriers might beaddressed with integrated system-level research and experimentation with the NASA F/A-18tail number (TN) 853 full-scale testbed. In particular, IRAC seeks opinions andsuggestions related to the following questions:  How would you envision the implementation of adaptive control in bothcurrent-generation and future-generation general aviation and transport aircraft?  What technical challenges do you feel adaptive control is best suited for? Are thereother mechanisms that may be better suited for addressing these challenges, or doesadaptive control provide unique capabilities?  What do you perceive as the most formidable obstacles to implementation of adaptivecontrol?  What obstacles to implementing adaptive control do you think can be answered with -- control theoretic analysis, -- simulation, -- subscale models with single-string avionics -- s/w and h/w in-the-loop simulation -- manned flight research using representative avionics (e.g., multi-string avionics) -- other forms of analysis such as formal methods  What type of pilot interaction with the adaptive controller and its elements will bebest suited for handling and recovering from upsets and uncertainties? For example,should adaptive control provide stability augmentation functions such that the pilotcommands attitude through stick-and-rudder, or should the pilot instead provideouter-loop commands (e.g., heading and altitude targets) similar to current autopilotcommands?  Are there other challenges with implementing adaptive control that cannot be answeredwith NASAs planned manned flight research, either due to the vehicle used (a militaryfighter) or inherent limitations on the cases that can be examined in flight research?  What are the most promising emerging adaptive control techniques that should beconsidered for further investigation? 3. Process In Fiscal Year 2009, IRAC is pursuing a four-step process to define an experimentalflight test program for maturing the technology readiness of adaptive controltechnologies and architectures. Step 1. Internal NASA-only Kick-off Workshop NASA initiated an internal one-day workshop to lay out an initial set of objectives andexperiments that could be conducted using the F/A-18 flight test vehicle. Theseobjectives and experiments are in support of answering questions related to technologybarriers for adaptive control implementation. In answering these questions, thecapabilities of the F/A-18 test vehicle and the resources available to NASA wereidentified and considered. Tentative integrated system-level research experiments tosupport the objectives were laid out and are presented in Appendix B, see attachment. TheIRAC project has identified three broad objectives for the experimental flight testprogram. These objectives are subject to change based on the responses received as aresult of this RFI and subsequent discussions with interested parties. Step 2. IRAC RFI Released to the Community Solicit information through this RFI on the key areas of interest from the externalcommunity and determine potential areas to form collaborative arrangements. Step 3. Community Outreach Meeting / Peer-Review Workshop Review the community feedback with interested individuals, industry teams, educationalinstitutions, non-profit organizations, and companies engaged in foundational research.This is currently planned to be held in June of 2009 in conjunction with American ControlConference at St. Louis, Missouri. Step 4. Internal NASA-only Review Develop the experimental research plan for execution at the field centers and establishinternal milestones. The responses to this RFI will provide important source material tothe NASA research teams to be used in establishing specific collaborative partnerships. 4. Information for Respondents 4.1 How to Respond Respondents are requested to submit a white paper of ten (10) pages maximum, with minimum12-point Times font. All white papers shall include the company or institute name,point-of-contact, address, phone number and email. These responses may include referencesto material available in the public literature; NASAs consideration of these referenceswill be aided by the respondent discussing the importance of and unique capabilitiesdescribed by any cited material. Please submit all responses in electronic format to the Point-of-Contact listed below byNOON Eastern Daylight Time, April 30, 2009: Questions regarding this RFI should also be addressed to the Point-of-Contact. 4.2 Proprietary or Confidential Information Since provided information will be incorporated into a larger summary of the collectedresponses that will be published by NASA, respondents are NOT to provide any informationthat is considered proprietary, trade secrets, or privileged or confidential. Anyresponse that includes data or information with markings indicating that the data orinformation is non-public, proprietary or may not be republished will be considerednon-responsive and will be returned.

SCOPE: The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division is seekinginformation on commercial availability of alkaline batteries with low-magneticproperties, preferably non-magnetic properties.  Form factor should be thestandard "D-cell." (a.k.a. LR20)  Typical commercial-off-the-shelf alkalinebatteries are encased in steel jacket housing, this results in a strong andvarying magnetic moment that is troublesome to deal with.  A comparable alkalinebattery in the same form factor and typical power sourcing capability is soughtthat minimizes this magnetic effect from the steel components.  We'd beinterested in learning about any power sources in the same form factor meetingMIL-DTL-19595 specifications also.

<a href="mailto:Barbour.Beverly@epa.gov">BEVERLY A. BARBOUR</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Eastern Research Group Incorporated (ERG), the addition of two pollutant sample analysis categories to Delivery Order Contract EP-D-09-048.  This is pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements."
The EPA, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) is currently assisting states in implementing an initiative directed by the EPA Administrator to measure potential air toxic pollution near designated schools across the country.  This assistance  involves coordination with the states and purchasing lab analysis services to analyze samples taken at specified schools.  There are eight pollutant categories on the list to be monitored at the schools.  OAQPS currently has a contract for lab support services with ERG, which covers six of the eight pollutant categories.  This award to ERG would expand the scope of Delivery Order Contract EP-D-09-048, awarded March 31, 2009 to include analysis of samples in the categories of Diisocyanates and 4, 4'-Methylenedianiline  for the duration of the contract.  It is essential for this study that one laboratory perform all the analyses to ensure the exact same methods, quality assurance practices and data reporting procedures will be used across all the pollutants being measured.  Because this is a priority initiative, sample collection and analyses must begin immediately to meet expressed dead lines. 
 Based on the above, the EPA believes that only ERG through this contract, can supply the needed services within the time frame the Agency requires, interested parties who believe that they are qualified to perform these services, are encouraged to submit a written narrative statement fully explaining their capabilities.  Any such statements must be submitted within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice (on or before April 24, 2009 at 5 PM EST).  Interested parties may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement within 15 days to Beverly Barbour at barbour.beverly@epa.gov. 
 This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested Vendors shall; 1) include information on the proposed services which clearly supports the requirements outlined above; 2) fully explain your capabilities and qualifications and: 3) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  Response to this synopsis must be made in writing.  No telephone or fax requests will be honored.  
The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFP) is available at this time.

<DESC><p>Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, Management &amp; Operating Contractor of the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is requesting information from prospective offers to provide: <br />Field Emission High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope <br />A new generation high resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) with a configuration optimized (and customized) to enable microscopy and spectroscopy is being planned as a major new capability for the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL), a national US Department of Energy (DOE) User Facility located at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). This instrument will be designed to allow microscopy and spectroscopy measurements relevant to catalytic and geochemical studies of importance to energy and environmental applications. Because EMSL is a user facility, we are looking for ease of operation, friendly for user training and operation, high instrument durability and excellent instrument service. The system envisioned is a high resolution electron microscope that should be able to provide the following capabilities:
<p>(1) High resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging<br />(2) high spatial resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging<br />(3) High energy resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS)<br />(4) Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system<br />(5) Image acquisition and recording systems</p>
<p>To answer important questions about the interfacial and defect control of catalytic reactions and the chemical nature of nanoparticles, the microscope shall be equipped with an electron beam with low energy spread and high resolution electron energy loss detector. This will allow detailed chemical information to be obtained with an energy resolution of about 0.3 eV to 0.8 eV or better in electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). To obtain important information about the role of interface and particle structure on chemical reactivity, the microscope will need to have a point to point resolution better than 1.9 Angstrom (0.19 nm) for TEM imaging and a resolution of better than 1.0 Angstrom (0.1 nm) for STEM bright and dark field imaging. To achieve the STEM resolution, the microscope will need to have an aberration corrector for the STEM probe forming lens (Cs-probe corrector). Gatan image filter (GIF) should be incorporated to energy filtered imaging technique and an energy dispersive x-ray detector system should be incorporated for chemical composition analysis. <br />Interested firms shall also provide information in the following areas as available:<br />1) A description of current experience, knowledge and capabilities directly applicable to the performance of the scope identified.<br />2) Brochures providing descriptions of equipment, maintenance and standard warranty, along with a current published commercial pricelist.<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort that will best address PNNL's needs.

Notice of Intent to Award on a Sole Source Basis

THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS ANNOUNCEMENT, A MARKET SURVEY FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR QUOTE. PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION, AS ONE DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXIST.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO ACCESS THE MARKET’S CAPABILITY AND TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIAL VENDORS.

1.)  USTRANSCOM Contracting Office intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  

2.)  In 2007, USTRANSCOM selected the Intelligent Road/Rail Information System (IRRIS) as its defense enterprise Geographic Information System (GIS).  IRRIS is designed to view, track, and monitor Department of Defense (DoD) assets by merging static data (such as infrastructure data on roads, bridges, and tunnels) with near-real-time data (such as traffic reports, weather conditions, construction updates, and logistics tracking) into one application available on the world wide web.  IRRIS is designed as a high-end geospatial framework, utilized to develop new applications quickly and to integrate with different user's enterprise geospatial database.  SDDC/TEA-SA and USTRANSCOM J3/CIP plan to improve the mapping data available in Classified IRRIS (CIRRIS) by adding new data rich infrastructure layers.

<DESC><p>The inaugural United States Air, Trade, and Technology (USATT) Expo will take place on 14-19 July 2009. This aerospace event is the result of a Congressionally-funded study identifying the need for a U.S.-based air, trade and technology event. The Air Force Association (Ohio Chapter) and the Dayton Area Defense Contractors Association are hosting this event. The Expo will combine three key elements: an aerospace technology conference, a targeted trade show, and an air show. It will provide an opportunity for the aerospace industry and key government officials to discuss current and future challenges in the aerospace sector. The aerospace technology conference will include six tracks: 1) Advanced Manufacturing Techniques, 2) Alternative Energy/Fuels, 3) Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), 4) Sensors, 5) Human Performance and Aerospace Medicine, and 6) Wright Dialogue with Industry (WDI). WDI has historically been a separate conference during which industry and academia engage with the Air Force Research Laboratory on technology challenges and planned government solicitations. WDI is being incorporated into the technology portion of the Expo as one of the six tracks and requires attendees to submit a valid DD 2345 form to participate. The first five tracks will be open to an international audience and have no attendance restrictions. You are invited to attend, sponsor, exhibit, submit an abstract to present or submit a poster presentation. Visit the web site for sponsorship and exhibiting information. Also, visit the "speaker zone" on the web site to submit a presentation abstract or poster presentation that will be reviewed by the conference planning committee. For questions on submitting a presentation abstract or poster presentation contact Jay Walker JWalker@TechnologyForums.com or call 703-740-1953. For questions regarding exhibit and sponsorship opportunities contact Donna Massey DMassey@TechnologyForums.com or call 703-740-1943.

<DESC>Notice of Intent:  The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award to Evonik Degussa Corporation a purchase order for the chemical TMT-55 for use in sludge stabilization at the Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel Processing Plant in Leadville CO.
Reclamation has found that Evonik Degussa Corp. is the only source of the chemical readily available which matches the product that will successfully ensure that the discharged sludge is no longer hazardous to people and the environment.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  Since the government believes that only one responsible source can provide the product that will satisfy the agency's requirements, a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared and approved by the Great Plains Regional Office Chief of Contracting.  
The Government intends to award this requirement on or about April 16, 2009, however all dates in this announcement are subject to change.  Firms that recognize and can provide the required work described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received before the anticipated award date will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) Number and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard of 100 employees under the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 424690.  Responses to this notice should be mailed to Bureau of Reclamation, GP-3800, 316 N. 26th St., Billings MT 59107; via facsimile to 406-247-7798 Attn:  Arlene Stern; or by E-mail to astern@usbr.gov. 
Effective October 1, 2003, prospective vendors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database may make an offeror ineligible for award.  The CCR Handbook and information on the registration process can be obtained via the CCR website, http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423. 
Offerors will be required to complete the annual representation and certification electronically via the Online Representation and Certification Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bnp.gov.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Microsystems Technology
Office (MTO), intends to award a Sole-Source contract to Jazz Semiconductor,
Inc. for the Gratings of Regular Arrays and Trim Exposure (GRATE) Program.<span>&nbsp; </span>The concept of the GRATE Program is to develop
revolutionary circuit design methodologies combined with novel lithographic
processes to enable cost effective low volume microfabrication for Department
of Defense (DoD) RF/mixed-signal applications.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of the key goals of the GRATE Program is to extend the capability of
trailing edge lithography tools to more advanced technology nodes using novel
design and lithographic processes.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
GRATE concept is based on designing all critical circuit features using only
highly regular geometries and coupling this novel design approach with
lithographic processing based on the customization of highly regular grating
patterns.<span>&nbsp; </span>Another key goal of the
Program is the demonstration of state of the art SiGe BiCMOS RF devices &amp;
circuits using trailing edge lithography tools.<span>&nbsp; </span>Jazz Semiconductor, Inc. has a well established 180 nm process
technology and toolset for both RF BiCMOS and digital SRAM.<span>&nbsp; </span>The RF performance (speed) of its BiCMOS
devices is currently limited by their current lithography toolset.<span>&nbsp; </span>Jazz has a successful foundry service with
many commercial and DoD customers. <span>&nbsp;</span>Jazz
is therefore the ideal candidate for demonstrating both the extension of
trailing edge lithography as well as achieving leading-edge RF BiCMOS devices
using the &ldquo;GRATE&rdquo; methodology.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government
intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR
6.302-1 &ldquo;Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will
satisfy agency requirements.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>As a successful
mixed-signal foundry at the 180nm node, Jazz possesses unique knowledge,
capabilities and intellectual property required to carry out the required
research effort at low risk and minimum cost. <span>&nbsp;</span>Success of this Program will enable Jazz to
provide cost effective low volume microfabrication capabilities at more
advanced technology nodes for DoD &amp; Defense RF/mixed-signal applications as
well as providing the DoD with additional options for the supply of on-shore
foundry services.<span>&nbsp; </span>This notice of intent
is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently
available.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, interested parties
may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.<span>&nbsp; </span>Responses/proposals received within
forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this notice will be
considered by the Government.<span>&nbsp; </span>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of
determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<span>&nbsp; </span>A determination by the Government not to
compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the
discretion of the Government.<span>&nbsp; </span>Interested
parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by
submitting a white paper and past performance data by no later than 25 May 2009
(2:00PM Eastern) to The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Attn: Mr.
Michael Blackstone, Contracts Management Office (CMO), 3701 North Fairfax
Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 or via email to <a href="mailto:michael.blackstone@darpa.mil">michael.blackstone@darpa.mil</a>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Questions shall be submitted to the above
email address.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please refer to Numbered
Note 22. <em>It is noted that DARPA&rsquo;s Microsystems
Technology Office (MTO) maintains an annual Office-wide Broad Agency
Announcement (BAA) seeking revolutionary research in electronics, photonics,
MEMS, algorithms, and combined Microsystems technology to deliver new

<DESC>LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATIONAND APPROVAL - FSS - FAR 8.4I.	Contracting Organization FAR 8.405-6(g)(2):          	  The Department of Veteran Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, VISN 23 Contracting Directorate is the contracting organization responsible for this Individual Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition. The Procuring Contracting Specialist is Suzanne Angelo, (612)-629-7319.II.	Description of Action FAR 8.405-6(g)(2):					This Individual Justification and Approval (J&A) authorizes the use of Limited Sources Justification procedures for the Department of Veterans Affairs to obtain a Patient Monitoring & Telemetry Upgrade Project as part of an over-arching Clinical Information System Project. This shall include an upgrade of bedside, central, telemetry, and other monitoring system infrastructure in four VISN 23 facilities located in Minneapolis, MN, Omaha, NB, Sioux Falls, SD, and Des Moines, IA.  The resultant Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded sole source to GE Medical Systems, DSCP Medical Equipment Group, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA.  III. 	Description of Supplies/Services - FAR 8.405-6(g)(2):	The Patient Monitoring & Telemetry Upgrade Project shall include an upgrade of Sioux Falls, Central Iowa, Minneapolis, and Omaha's bedside, central, telemetry, and other monitoring system infrastructure at each of the respective Medical Centers. The project shall also include expansion of patient monitoring and telemetry systems capabilities to include the ability to transfer physiologic information to from the monitors to the electronic patient chart, and view waveforms from a remote location. This functionality is a necessity to a successful Clinical Information System that is anticipated to be procured in FY09 for 7 VISN 23 facilities under a separate procurement. Overall, the new system(s) shall provide state-of-the-art physiological monitoring functions configured to the unique requirements of VISN 23.  The system shall provide integration to Clinical Information System (CIS), Anesthesia Record Keeping (ARK), MUSE (current EKG Diagnostic Review and Storage System), MARS (current vital signs event capture system at MVAMC), Admit-Discharge-Transmit (ADT) In-Bound messages from CIS In-Bound messages from CIS, and other medical informatics systems ensuring work flow efficiency and improved patient safety.  The estimated cost: $324,674. This acquisition is anticipated to be awarded by 15 April 2009 in the estimated amount of, $$324,674 of funding.  All items should be delivered, installed, and accepted by the VA prior to August 31, 2009.VI.	Applicability of Authority - FAR 8.405-6(a)(2):				 GE Medical System already provides a private networking "fiber backbone", 12-Lead EKG at the bedside and archive to MUSE, Full Disclosure functions, and integration to the future Clinical Information System (CIS) and Anesthesia Record Keeping (ARK) systems at two of VISN 23's four sites that use GE Monitoring Systems. On this basis, planning and funding for this project includes upgrades to VISN 23's existing GE infrastructure and monitoring system in order to make the system able to view waveforms remotely and bi-directionally communicate with an anticipated ICU-CIS, ARK, and Virtual ICU. V.	Efforts to Obtain Competition - FAR :	 N/A  VI.	Fair and Reasonable Costs - FAR 8.404(d):		Supplies offered of the GSA schedule are listed at fixed prices.  GSA has already determined the prices of supplies.  Therefore, VAMC is not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing, except for a price evaluation as required by 8.405-2(d).  By placing an order against a schedule contract using the procedures in 8.405, VAMC has concluded that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs.  VII.	Market Research - FAR 8.405-6(g)(2):			FAR Part 10 directs that market research be conducted on each acquisition appropriate to the circumstances. Research results serve to confirm that General Electric is the best vendor to be chosen for this award. Since the cost of upgrading the current system is far less than replacing all monitoring systems at the 4 VISN 23 sites that have these systems installed and in use.	VIII.	Other Facts - FAR 8.405-6(g)(2):				             VISN 23 has previously purchased and installed GE Medical System physiological and telemetry monitoring systems in Minneapolis, MN, Omaha, NB, Sioux Falls, SD, and Des Moines, IA. The existing equipment and infrastructure totals over $5Million.   The cost to upgrade these monitoring systems to enable necessary functionality for the ICU-CIS, ARK, and Virtual ICU is a small percentage of the cost of the entire system. Replacement of the entire monitoring systems at these four VISN 23 Medical Centers is not in the scope of this project, and is not funded. IX.	Interested Sources - FAR 8.4056-(g)(2):			At the present time, the only source to be able to do the upgrade without replacing the entire system thus the cost benefit would be too costly.	X.	Steps to Foster Competition - FAR 8.405-6(g)(2):		At the present time, there are other competitors but the cost benefit ration is too big to have the entire system re-bid. XI.	Contracting Officer's Certification - FAR 8.405-6(g)(2):	I hereby certify, as evidenced by the signature on the J&A Coordination and Approval Cover Page, that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification are both accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. XII.	Technical/Requirements Personnel's Certification     N/ASUZANNE ANGELOCONTRACTING OFFICER

4. Background: The NGJ system is intended to replace the capability currently enabled by the ALQ-99 jamming pods, providing a significant enhancement to the EA-18G’s EA capabilities at a reduced operations and sustainment cost.  First identified in the 2002 AEA System of Systems (SoS) AoA, there is a compelling need, founded in both capability and sustainability to move beyond the ALQ-99. This need was recently re-validated in the Joint AEA (JAEA) Study, conducted by the Office of Secretary of Defense Program, Analysis and Evaluation [OSD (PA&E)].  A subsequent Program Decision Memorandum in December 2007 provided funding to initiate the Technology Development phase of an NGJ program.  On October 15th 2008, the AEA/EA-6B Program Manager, PEO-T/PMA-234, posted a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for NGJ Trade Studies, awards for which are anticipated early in 2009.  These 6-month studies will analyze NGJ mission needs, explore trades related to system effectiveness and architectures, develop a system technical baseline, and define corresponding program planning documentation.  In November 2007, the Office of Naval Research initiated the Next Generation AEA (NGAEA) Future Naval Capabilities Enabling Capability project.  This 5-year project will pursue high-risk, high-payoff component technology development capable of transition to future NGJ sub-systems.  Phase 0 of the NGAEA project explored NGJ system concepts and identified critical technology needs.  The remaining four years of the NGAEA project will develop component technologies capable of integrating into NGJ sub-system designs and providing improved performance and/or reduced cost, size, weight and prime power consumption.


5. AoA Guidance: Information below provides a summary of key information contained within the approved AoA Guidance. More complete AoA Guidance will be provided in the NGJ AoA Directives Extracts Document (See GFI). In accordance with Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff instructions; the USN completed a NGJ Functional Solutions Analysis (FSA) to illustrate how the NGJ system can provide a solution to current and projected EA-18G/ALQ-99 program of record gaps in war fighting capability.  The FSA concluded that no non-materiel solutions to the acknowledged EA-18G/ALQ-99 gaps exist.  The materiel solutions explored in the FSA show the NGJ system provides increased war fighting capabilities over the ALQ-99 on the EA-18G.  The FSA cost estimates for NGJ found the potential program to be an Acquisition Category (ACAT) ID level program.  

An AoA is required to determine courses of action to correct current and projected gaps in ALQ-99 capability and supportability.  The scope of the NGJ AoA will include analysis of the ALQ-99 TJS baseline and potential NGJ candidates to be initially integrated onto the EA-18G and potentially the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. When employed against a target set that includes conventional and irregular warfare radar and communications systems, NGJ-equipped aircraft are expected to have the same, or better, level of airborne electronic attack capability as an EA-6B ICAP3 aircraft, operating the ALQ-99 and ALQ-218 systems.  NGJ should provide improved Reliability, Maintainability and Availability (RMA) over that of the ALQ-99. All NGJ alternatives will be assessed as candidates for use by the EA-18G and F-35.  There are three alternative categories for the NGJ AoA.  They are as follows:

Alternative Category 1: Incremental modernization of the current ALQ-99 TJS sub-system, starting with the oldest and/or most critical bands (such as Bands 4 and 5/6).

Alternative Category 2: Fielding of a new jamming system that draws on technology at technology readiness level (TRL) 5 or 6.  Concepts within this alternative should incorporate commercial off-the-shelf technology as feasible.  

Alternative Category 3: Exploration of the costs and benefits of a new jamming system based on a lower initial TRL.  Concepts within this alternative should initially address the core component requirement currently filled by the ALQ-99.  However, it should use technologies that could be adapted for future jamming systems that address all AEA system of systems mission areas


6. RFI Response Input to AoA: The Navy requests from interested sources information for system concepts that fit within the AoA Alternatives Categories described in Section 5. One or more concepts may be submitted for each alternative or sources can limit information to only one concept for one alternative. For each concept, technical and program-related information is desired that addresses each of the following areas:

a.	Identification of the AoA Alternative Category which the concept addresses
b.	The platform or platforms (EA-18G, F-35A/B/C, both platforms) to which the concept applies 
c.	Concepts of operations, expressed through DoD Architectural Framework Operational Views, depicting use of NGJ-equipped platforms, within the AEA System of Systems, for Suppression of Enemy Air Defense and Irregular Warfare missions
d.	A description for the concept that illustrates its major sub-systems, estimated size, weight and prime power demands, and its installation on the platform(s). Information explaining how the concept addresses needs for modular and open architecture is desired.    
e.	The technical aspects of the platform integration for the system concept, including its interfaces with other systems (weapons systems, controls/displays, etc) on the platform and any projected platform modifications.  Interfaces with and required modifications to existing AEA receivers, ES/ESM receivers & Radar systems should be described, as should impacts to platform performance (e.g. range, ceiling, on-station time, signature).  If the concept involves the use and integration of new hardware/software with a portion of the ALQ-99 (e.g. Low Band Pod containing Low Band Transmitters and Universal Exciter Upgrade), a description of such and identification of associated issues is desired.  
f.	An assessment of the performance of the concept compared to the NGJ System Capabilities Document and the QFD Final Report (see GFI). This assessment should include information concerning RMA improvements over the current ALQ-99. Specific information is desired concerning the concepts functioning within the AEA SoS and its attributes or functions relating to EW Battle Management.  
g.	An assessment of interoperability considerations for the concept  (including own-ship, friendly forces, civilian systems, quality of service, and battle management) and the architecture implications. 
h.	Identification and discussion of the component and sub-system technologies required to develop the concept, their current TRL, the time lines required to achieve TRL 7 (based on program initiation in 2010), any NGJ-specific technology maturation required, and the ability and degree of difficulty to integrate component technologies into sub-systems and sub-systems into a system.
i.	A description of any assumed product support strategy, including maintenance concepts and associated integrated logistics support elements, such as support equipment, spares/provisioning, training/trainers, manpower & facilities, and technical data.  
j.	A rough-order-of magnitude cost estimate of the major program phases to develop and field the concept program, possibly including Technology Development, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, Production and Deployment up to Initial Operational Capability (IOC), and full rate production required to meet Full Operational Capability (FOC). IOC is defined as the successful testing and fielding of a sufficient number of NGJ systems and all required logistics support elements in order to meeting initial training requirements and deploy a single 5-aircraft EA-18G squadron. FOC is defined as the fielding of a sufficient number of NGJ systems and all required logistics support elements, including spares, to outfit all ten Navy EA-18G squadrons, plus the Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS). If possible, provide a high level work breakdown structure against which the major cost elements of the program would be allocated.  In addition, cost estimates for integrated logistics support elements and other life cycle cost elements are desired.   
k.	An assessment of the ability to develop and field the concept system in a manner that achieves IOC in late 2018 and identification of alternative schedules required or recommended.  In addition to this assessment, provide an estimated schedule of major events and milestones for the concept.  
l.	An assessment of technical, schedule and cost risks envisioned for the concept and recommendations for mitigation of risks assessed as moderate or high.   
m.	Identification of any opportunities to capitalize on other military and commercial investments/programs in order to improve capability or reduce costs, schedule and risks.  If possible, please cite names of any programs cited and describe a vision for capitalizing on the stated opportunity.  Describe any opportunities for which an NGJ concept could fulfill a capability gap outside of the AEA war fighting area.
n.	Completed Level I and II Technical Description Documents (Templates provided as GFI).       

	There are no page limits for information that may be submitted.  The Government desires submitted responses to be formatted in a manner that organizes information to follow paragraphs a) through n) immediately above and be submitted with a table of contents.

<p><strong>PROJECT:	RECOVERY - Architectural/Engineering (A/E) Services for the Otay Mesa Land Port of Entry (LPOE) Modernization &amp; Expansion</strong></p>
<p><strong> Funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (Public Law 11-5) (Recovery Act)</strong></p>
<p><strong>LOCATION:	San Diego, California</strong></p>
<p><br />This notice is provided for informational purposes only.  This opportunity is available only to contractors who have received an awarded national GSA Indefintie Delivery Indefinte Quantity (IDIQ) contract in Zone 1 to provide A/E services.  Zone 1 covering the states of California, Arizona, Idaho, Washington, Alaska, and Montana.  The contract number is GS-07P-08-HDD-0050.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Design and Construction Division (9PC) has a requirement to procure services from a highly qualified A/E firm to develop design documents for the Otay Mesa Land Port of Entry (LPOE) Modernization Project in San Diego, California.  The design documents provided will establish the scope of work for the prospectus construction project.  It is important to note that this project is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (Public Law 11-5) (Recovery Act).</p>
<p>The last major renovation to the Otay Mesa LPOE was completed in 1996 and at that time it was estimated that nearly 4 million inspections were being conducted per year at the port.  Since then studies have been conducted and demonstrated that the number of inspections has nearly doubled to approximately 8 million per year.  Current projections suggest that Otay Mesa will continue to experience a significant increased inspection demand that may reach roughly 18 million per year by 2030.  The current prospectus construction project seeks to modernize current security systems and other facilities in order to achieve the following (in no particular order);<br />&bull;	Meet heightened security requirements set forth by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)<br />&bull;	Provide safe, secure, and efficient operational areas for the public and federal employees<br />&bull;	Reduce mounting vehicular (commercial and non-commercial) and foot traffic congestion at the LOPE<br />&bull;	Facilitate international commerce<br />&bull;	Improve energy and water efficiency</p>
<p>This selected A/E will be awarded a firm-fixed price delivery order through the A/E Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Zone 1.  This delivery order will consist of complete design services including the preparation of construction documents for the proposed work. The scope of the A/E Services may include but is not limited to Pre-design Services (including special studies and surveys) Concepts, Design Development, Construction Documents (in preparation of Working Drawings in AutoCAD or BIM, Specifications, Estimating Services, Value Engineering) and Post Construction Contract Award Services, in addition to other supplemental services as appropriate to the project needs.  The project will be delivered through a traditional design-bid-build method.</p>
<p>Each A/E firm under the GSA national A/E IDIQ contract for Zone 1 will be provided a fair opportunity to participate on the project in concurrence with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 16.505.  In addition this selection process will be subject to FAR Part 36.602 for A/E selection.  Ultimately the award will be made to the most highly qualified A/E firm that provides best value to the Government and with whom a mutually satisfactory delivery order can be negotiated.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor.

The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: 
The lowest price technically acceptable offer for this brand name only requirement will represent best value to the Government.  The government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price Contract.

BUSINESS QUOTE INSTRUCTIONS:  
Offerors shall price each CLIN and shall submit firm-fixed pricing for all CLINS, otherwise your quote will be determined to be substantially incomplete and not warrant any further consideration.  If no separate price for a CLIN this must be stated.  Brand name only. No substitutions will be allowed.  Shipping shall be FOB Destination.  Business quotes will be evaluated for Completeness (all CLINS are priced) and Reasonableness (the degree to which the proposed prices compare to prices that are reasonable, prudent person would expect to incur for the same or similar equipment and commensurate with the Governments need).

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all interested quoters may submit a quote. 

Background:
NIST requires two laser wavelength meters for the Atomic Physics Laboratory: one meter will measure near-infrared wavelengths (500-1700 nanometers), the other meter will measure infrared wavelengths (1000-5000 nanometers). The meters will be used to characterize the wavelengths from a tunable, continuous wave (CW) optical parametric oscillator (OPO). Light from the OPO will be launched into resonant semiconductor microcavities to probe for second-order optical nonlinearities. The wavelength meters will allow precise measurement of the resonances. The meters need to measure the wavelengths to an absolute accuracy of &#61617;0.75 parts per million or better, with repeatability &#61617;0.1 parts per million or better. The meters should allow free-space coupling and have a HeNe laser to aid in alignment.

Both meters shall be manufactured by the same company.

All interested Contractor’s shall provide a quote for the following line items: 

LINE ITEM 0001: Laser Wavelength Meter, meeting or exceeding all of the following required minimum specifications: 
A. Shall be a complete unit that measures near-IR wavelengths from 500 to 1700 nanometers;
B. Shall measure wavelength of continuous-wave (CW), near-infrared (near-IR) and IR laser radiation;
C. The absolute accuracy of the wavelength measurement shall be ±0.75 parts per million or better (&#61617;0.00075 nanometer accuracy at 1000 nanometer wavelength);
D. The repeatability of the measurement shall be ±0.1 parts per million or better;
E. The meter shall output a HeNe laser for use as a tracer beam to aid alignment; 
F. The meter shall utilize free-space coupling (2mm diameter aperture or larger) for the near-IR and IR beams;
G. The minimum input power shall be 300µW or lower in the near-IR wavelength range, and 1mW or lower in the IR;
H. Shall be able to interface with a computer.

LINE ITEM 0002: Laser Wavelength Meter, meeting or exceeding all of the following required minimum specifications:
A. Shall be a complete unit that measures IR wavelengths from 1000-5000 nanometers;
B. Shall measure wavelength of continuous-wave (CW), near-infrared (near-IR) and IR laser radiation;
C. The absolute accuracy of the wavelength measurement shall be ±0.75 parts per million or better (±0.00075 nanometer accuracy at 1000 nanometer wavelength);
D. The repeatability of the measurement shall be ±0.1 parts per million or better;
E. The meter shall output a HeNe laser for use as a tracer beam to aid alignment; 
F. The meter shall utilize free-space coupling (2mm diameter aperture or larger) for the near-IR and IR beams;
G. The minimum input power shall be 300µW or lower in the near-IR wavelength range, and 1mW or lower in the IR;

II.   Statement of Work for a USPSC/TCN Personal Services Contractor (PSC) Education
       Officer and Team Leader, USAID/LIBERIA



A. Background

Liberia’s human development indicators reflect impoverished conditions caused by the fourteen year armed conflict and the collapse of governance institutions. Over 80% of Liberia’s population lives below the poverty line; unemployment exceeds 70%; approximately 35% are chronically malnourished; 72% are not fully immunized; 75% do not have access to safe drinking water; and 64% do not have access to sanitation facilities. The education sector is particularly challenged as almost an entire generation has missed formal primary education and honed their survival instincts without the socialization skills that come from living in a peaceful society. 

Over 80 percent of the education system - along with the national economy structure throughout Liberia - was destroyed and disrupted by the civil war that ended in 2003.  Not only has the physical infrastructure been battered, but the human support structure has been decimated through death or displacement.  The large reduction in the numbers of qualified teachers and administrators, coupled with the breakdown of information, supply and payment systems has left the education system poorly positioned to rebuild itself.  Fortunately, education is high on the list of what Liberians want --for themselves, for their children, for economic, social, and democratic growth.

Many of the early post-civil war responses provided education through emergency programming by partners or by private, including religious, schools.  While some of these schools accept all students, many are only affordable to those very few that have some income; those who are economically disadvantaged remain further deprived. Hundreds of today’s youth have had little or no schooling due to the violence and are too mature (in terms of physical and mental development) to enroll in traditional formal education programs. Many have other life responsibilities, such as providing economically for self and families and caring for the infirmed, that preclude them spending the time in school.  Many were child soldiers, all were affected by the war, and some have been orphaned by the war and HIV/AIDS and other diseases. Special programs have been directed at those that can pay, while those with special needs or missed opportunities, the returnees, and the rest of the population have received little attention. 

Currently 25% of the schools are classified as run by community, mission or other groups; 34% are privately run; and only 41% are run by the Government.  In 2003 it was estimated that only about 50 percent of the school-aged population of boys was enrolled, and 24 percent of girls, but less than 35 percent of either reaching fifth grade. (IRC Report 2005)  Where secondary schools are open and functioning, enrollment of boys is twice that for girls. Overall illiteracy rate is estimated at 63 percent, with 60 percent of the women and 42 percent of the men in 2000 never completing a year of school. Marriages and family responsibilities also contribute to the low levels of girls’ enrollments, with an estimated 30 percent of urban girls being married or in union before 18 years of age, and 58 percent of those in rural areas.  (State of the World’s Children, 2005).  

Teacher salaries are not only in arrears by many months, but their wages (at approximately $70 US per month,) are not adequate to support their families. As comparison, a bag of rice costs $35 US. There was insufficient money in the national budget to pay teachers. Rural teachers use almost their entire salary to reach Monrovia to collect their pay. Lack of transportation and a road network in total disrepair or impassable during the rainy season means they are often away from school for several days. Though statistics are neither reliable nor valid, an estimated 62 percent of the teachers are unqualified and have no training, many are volunteers. Most school and system administrators have had little education since their initial training which did not prepare them for the situation as it exists today. Few know the pedagogy that will allow them to address the psychosocial and academic needs of students.

International donors began addressing the education system during the period of government transition. UNICEF funded a ten-week crash course that provided a “C Certificate” for the over 60% of the primary teachers who had not received any training.  The certificate is based on the needs for teaching a revised curriculum for the Accelerated Learning Program (ALP), or packaging six years of primary education into three years for over-aged students. ALP was established in 1999 so as to provide access to education to a wider range of those uneducated.  The curriculum taught is an abbreviated version of the national primary curriculum which was fully revised in the 1980s. Neither the curriculum nor the pedagogy adequately addresses the needs of students today. 

Teaching materials and textbooks are few, as are supplies for the students. While school uniforms provide for equity and decent clothes, their cost frequently puts school attendance beyond reach for the average household or learner.  For those who are enrolled in school or training programs, Save the Children-UK estimated that funds frequently were generated by the students themselves through small or petty trade. Unfortunately, “girls are commonly engaged in transactional sex” to pay for their education. (Save 2005)  The actual full cost of education per household is not known, but is estimated between $3,000 and $4,100. However, it is clear that the majority, the poorest, are being excluded because of costs of schooling. These issues are supposedly being addressed under the Free and Compulsory Primary Education in Liberia (FACPEL) initiative which started in November, 2005. According to the Liberian Education for All National Action Plan of 2004, the Government has the responsibility for providing education for all. To meet this requirement will require significant resources at all levels, and a commitment to address the underlying causes and issues that keep children out of school.

USAID/Liberia Overview:

As Liberia begins the transition from a fragile state to a rebuilding country, USAID has sought to enhance public trust in the government through improvements in the provision of essential services. 

The Liberian Ministry of Education (MOE) continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to improving management of the sector and addressing weaknesses in service delivery. In collaboration with the development partners including USAID, UNICEF, European Commission, UNESCO and the Open Society Institute, the MOE has taken a leadership role in addressing the goals outlined in the Government of Liberia’s National Poverty Reduction Strategy and prioritized the development of an Education Sector Plan. The Ministry has increased donor coordination efforts to ensure progress on the current Liberia Primary Education Reform Program (LPERP), and accessed a pooled fund to fill resource gaps emerging from the formulation of a more accurate annual budget aligned with the sector plan and established donor projects. 

USAID/Liberia’s Education program supports activities that contribute to increasing access to quality basic education, addressing gaps in Higher Education and enhancing the technical/managerial capacity of the Liberian workforce. Interventions for increasing access school and furniture rehabilitation and repair; the provision of scholarships to primary school children covering tuition costs, school materials, uniforms, and transportation to and from school. Conversely, interventions targeting quality included the introduction of innovative learner-centered teacher training methods, such as interactive radio instruction programs; training teachers and education officials; and the provision of teaching and learning materials.

The Education Team Leader (ETL) is directly responsible for the strategic, conceptual and managerial leadership of all USAID/Liberia Basic Education, Higher Education and Participant Training activities in support of the Investing in People (IIP) Objective within USAID’s Foreign Policy Operational Framework. Moreover, his/her efforts contribute to results achieved under the Mission’s current Strategic Objective (SO)8 for the FY2005 – 2009 strategy period: Increased Access to Essential Services Provided by National and Local Organizations. The Education portfolio contributes to this SO by addressing the Intermediate Result of “Improved capacity for delivery of social services (health, basic education, vocational education) to underserved populations”.

He/she will also oversee the transition into the new FY2010 - 2014 strategy, which includes a newly formulated portfolio of Basic/Higher Education, Participant Training and workforce development-related activities implemented under the IIP objective. Activities such as Participant Training are funded by multiple technical programs - coupled with the Basic Education and Higher Education which represents a significant portion of the Mission’s operating year budget.  

The ETL directly supervises a staff of five which includes one Development Leadership Initiative (DLI) US Direct Hire, three FSN professionals, and one PSC/EFM Basic Education Advisor.  He/she also manages the work of multiple resident contract teams and their sub-grantees, as well as several USAID cooperating agencies providing periodic technical assistance through EGAT/Education mechanisms, Africa Bureau technical support and other contracting instruments.  The ETL works closely with representatives of other Mission offices, especially the Financial Management Unit and Program Office, in the implementation of managed activities.  He/she reports to the Mission Director.

The ETL advises, collaborates and consults with senior representatives of the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Planning (specifically for Participant Training), Higher Education institutions as well as other bilateral and international donors in the planning, formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Mission’s Education activities.  These include the Accelerated Learning Project PLUS, the Liberia Teacher Training Project, Early Grade Reading Assessment: Liberia, Participant Training, Ambassador’s Girls Scholarship Program, ALFALIT Adult Literacy and Books for Africa.

The ETL position will become vacant in June 2009, leading USAID/Liberia to seek applications for filling this position

The agency urgently needs temporary space, on a short-term basis, to handle their rapid growth in FTE.  The space must be located as closely as possible to their existing location to meet coordinated operational needs of the agency.  Only one building is within walking distance from their existing location that can immediately accommodate their space requirement.  Locating beyond that distance diminishes the operational capabilities of the agency in addition to adding travel, time and lost productivity costs.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization’s programmatic goals and objectives.



For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

OTI has become a recognized leader and authority among foreign assistance organizations in the field of communication and media development.  OTI’s recent initiatives have included support of underdeveloped media infrastructure, journalism, and regulatory frameworks, funding and directing critical transitional communications activities, and advancing the capacity of host government communications offices. OTI will consider any engagement that will address a political transition need and conforms to USG foreign assistance regulations.  In an effort to maintain and advance the Office’s stature in this arena, OTI employs a team of two dedicated media technical support positions: the Senior Media Specialist and the Senior Field Advisor – Media.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

Motor Oil:   5w-30  API rating:  SM       That is the latest API rating and should be very adequate
 
2.   HD Motor Oil:   15w-40   API rating:  ?????            Do you want the latest API rating:  CJ-4 ?      If you have any diesel engines built since 2007, API:  CJ-4 is       required for emissions.  Using a lesser rating will damage       the emission control system if the vehicle is so equipped.   

Answer: The SM will be fine for the 5w-30 and the CJ-4 for 15w-40.
Question: Buy Specifications: Line Item Description
Line item description is "Dexron II" . GM abandoned this specification years ago, replaced with Dexron IIE, then replaced with Dexron III.  General Motors only certifies and license Dexron VI for 2006 and newer vehicles.  It also covers all the old  specifications for Dexron.  Is Dexron VI acceptible or do you want a generic Dexron III?
GM Dexcool concentrate or 50/50?
Will the border patrol provide a loading dock and forklift to unload the drums if palletized?
Answer:  Dexron III and the Dexcool will need to be pure not 50-50.  We will help unload the drums.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The information contained herein supplements the original combined synopsis/solicitation, which can be viewed at http://ideasec.nbc.gov; do a quick search for document #Q9471091018.
Incorporate this information when preparing your quote.  NPS is providing the following answers to questions posed by interested vendors.  
Q1. Will the government's barge towing vessel be available to assist during the barge launching?  A1.  There will be an NPS vessel on site, but NPS will not assist with the launch.  Assembly and launching are the sole responsibility of the contractor.
Q2. Is the vendor's barge launching responsibility finalized when the assembled barge is moored dockside at the Old Mill Park boat launch?A2.  Yes. Q3. Is it permissible for the barge to be assembled in the lake, rather than in the parking lot at Old Mill Park?A3.  Yes, if the barge can be assembled within the available 24' width.  
Q4.  Will NPS employees assist during barge launching?A4.  No (see A1).
Q5.  Is aluminum construction acceptable for the barge?A5.  Aluminum is not preferred even if it meets our load capacity specs. The nature of the rocky shoreline where we often put in makes aluminum a less favorable option.
Q6.  Will alternate configurations to what we specified will be considered and evaluated?A6.  Offered products need to at least meet our minimum performance specifications to be considered.  You may suggest and price changes as options, which we'll consider.  For example, including fixtures for towing, mooring and anchoring is acceptable.  However, offers for barges that exceed the maximum dimensions stated in the solicitation (20' W x 40' L plus rakes) will not be considered.
Q7.  Are there any more details available about the launch site at Old Mill Park?A7.  The launch site includes three slips with cement ramps going down into the lake.  The center slip is the widest (24') and is defined by floating sidewalk-sized docks on either side anchored by pilings spaced approximately 6-8' apart.  The length of the docks exceeds 50', and is likely close to 80'.  On the outside edge of a neighboring slip, there is a log boom with pilings spaced along its length, which is overall 75' - 100'.  Lake Chelan is a reservoir whose elevation varies with the seasons.  Current lake level can be monitored at http://www.chelanpud.org/lake-chelan-lake-levels.cfm .  Photos are available at http://mansonparks.com/references.html.  Additional photos can be e-mailed upon request (send an e-mail to sarah_welch@nps.gov).  Driving directions are at http://www.chelanpud.org/driving-directions-to-old-mill-park.html.  
Q8.  What working radius would be best for the cranes reach?A8.  Working radius of 32' to 36'.
Q9.  What rated capacity for the crane would be best for your application?A9.  Lift 2000 lbs at 30'-36' distance.
Q10.  Who will pay for crane delivery to installer?A10.  NPS will arrange and pay for the transport of the crane (see (22) in solicitation).  Note the pick-up address for the crane in Item 2a in the price schedule, if you are offering a crane.
Q11.  In addition to providing photos of the barge and crane already used on Ross Lake, will you divulge the purchase price of those items?A11.  That purchase was far enough in the past that the purchase price is irrelevant to this action.
Q12.  Need more information on what kind of "industry-standard" rakes are desired (see specification (1)).A12.  The desired configuration is for a square (box) stern and sloped (raked) bow for the full width of each section.  If the rake is a separate item to be attached to the barge sections, rather than part of the overall design and fabrication, then the attachment system should follow that described in specification (3) in solicitation.  It is preferred that the system holding barge sections together and the system holding rakes to sections should be the same.  Rake surface should match the surface of the barge sections in condition and elevation.

<DESC><p>The Government has run into an unforeseen delay in release of the RFP Package. Corrections are currently being made to fix discrepancies between Request for Proposal documents. Furthermore, the Government's strategy has changed and there will now be two Solicitations (RFP's). The first under FA8604-09-R-7490, will be for the Writing of the Code and the second, under FA8604-09-R-7491, will be for the Testing of the Code. This will allow the Government to select two different contractors, one for each requirement. You may bid on both, but may only win one award.
<p>A notice will be posted under this solicitation when the Request for Proposals is released. No specific date is set, but the Government would like to post these solicitations as soon as possible.</p>

<RESPDATE>042709
<CONTACT>Azita Mamdouhi, Contract Specialist, Phone 2028744639, Email azita.mamdouhi@occ.treas.gov - Andrea  Katz, Contract Specialist, Phone 2028749933, Email andrea.katz@occ.treas.gov
<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issues this Sources Sought Synopsis to identify potential sources who are interested in and capable of providing the information technology services described herein. 

Business Need
Currently the Project Tracking System (PTS) is the primary tool used by the Chief Counsel’s Office (CCO) to track and report significant work, projects, and matters within the responsibility of the Chief Counsel. The current system was built in Lotus Notes.  CCO seeks to replace it with a system that is easier to use for inputting information and more flexible in providing information to managers. The desired solution will provide easier data entry, more consistency, reduced redundancies/errors, improved reporting, and overall better tracking and management of CCO projects including matters, tasks, work and resources. 
In many government and commercial enterprises, OCC’s PTS would be referred to as a case management system or a matter management system. In this document the terms “project” and “matter” are used interchangeably.
CCO is comprised of the Law, Licensing, and Community Affairs Departments with staff located in Washington, DC (HQ) and four district offices. There would be approximately OCC 250 users of the system although users may be of different types (e.g., heavy vs. occasional).
The OCC seeks interested vendors and contractors who are capable of implementing a new system to track and manage all work, projects, activities, and matters within CCO.
System Requirements
Final requirements are under development but the overall scope of the desired system includes: 

-  Features to allow CCO employees to standardize the process of entering, tracking, and updating their projects and matters, leading to more consistency, less duplication, and reduced errors. 

-  Well-designed reporting functionality including standard reports and the capability for users to create and run ad-hoc reports.

-  An interactive dashboard for listing and presenting matters according to user-defined criteria, with drill-down capabilities for greater visibility into the details and history of high-priority and specially designated activities, allowing first-level and senior management to better manage their portfolios of resources and tasks. 

-  Workflow, business process management or similar capabilities to improve communication and collaboration on matters, especially as between CCO managers/executives and their direct reports, including various methods to summarize and relay status information through configurable alerts and notifications or well-designed information displays.

-  Native document management capabilities and/or an established application programming interface for integrating with leading document management systems (key requirement is to associate documents with projects/matters).

-  Support for interfacing with other modern systems, such as the Central Application Tracking System as described in FedBizOps Solicitation Number CC-09-HQ-R-0038.  

-  Docketing and calendaring functions including tasks tied to matters/projects, task dates, task types, and options to set up task sequencing per templates or models keyed to matter types.

-  Robust core functionality for defining projects/matters, project types, people, assignments of people to matters including dates and duration of assignments, designation of specific roles (e.g. primary responsible vs. other roles) for people on specified matters, and structured data for status flags in matters.

-  Robust configuration capability to support (a) screen design, field additions and field labeling without custom programming and (b) disciplined method of preserving data structures and user interfaces common to all users while allowing for some group-specific configuration.
-  Capability to support textual status descriptions “inside” the project tracking system (in addition to a capability to associate documents to matters), such that monthly or other periodic reporting can be performed on status that includes presentation of status text in accordance with user-specified criteria.

-	Capability to output PTS data and text to tools such as Microsoft Word and Excel.

-	A data model that is, or can be developed to be, easily analyzed and researched for purposes of understanding data relationships vital to reporting capabilities.

-	 A security model that provides different levels of access to system data and functions based upon defined roles and access privileges.

-	 Modern application architecture and user interface design that is extensible and friendly to integrations, especially in regard to Microsoft products including Microsoft Office/Outlook, Active Directory, etc.

-	 Capability to allow CCO staff to record their time in a matter-specific fashion using a convenient interface (e.g., portal-style access to functions is a possible approach); and an associated capability to report this data in various ways and/or to output the data to other systems.

-	 Compliance with Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) policy with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.

<DESC>SAQMMA09R0164 - Worldwide A/E Services - Small Business


The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management, on behalf of the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations, anticipates awarding indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contracts for Architect/Engineer (A/E) services in each of the following four small business categories: 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, and Small Business. The Government anticipates awarding four contracts if a sufficient number of qualified contractors respond for each category.

The business shall be a professionally licensed architectural firm providing architectural and engineering services for new construction projects, project planning, facility renovation, rehabilitation, restoration, and system replacement projects, physical and technical security upgrades, and the construction and renovation of post communications centers at US diplomatic foreign service posts worldwide. The applicable NAICS code is 541310.  At least fifty percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. The estimated cost of construction for projects design under the award IDIQ contracts is not expected to exceed, but is not limited to, $10 million. Projects may include design-build definition or bridging work. Involvement in such projects may affect the A/E's ability to participate in competitively-sourced follow-on work or design-build teams for that project. 

Each contract shall consist of a one-year base period with four one-year optional service periods.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $100,000 in task orders over the life of the contract.  The total amount of orders issued under this contract shall not exceed $5,000,000, over the life of the contract.  

The contract will be for professional services to include, but not be limited to, facility assessments and architectural and engineering studies, site utilization studies and master planning, conceptual, preliminary and schematic designs, design development, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates and budget assessments, as well as life-cycle analysis, quality assurance reviews of the work of other A/E firms, research and development studies, value engineering studies or reviews, support services, and construction phase services and claims analysis services.  

Contract services may include the following: architecture, historic preservation, landscape architecture, long range planning, master planning, initial and detailed planning, space planning, site utilization, cost estimating, budget assessment, interior design, food service design, scheduling, and environmental and sustainability design.  In addition, the following engineering disciplines shall be provided: electrical, mechanical, structural, blast, civil, geotechnical, environmental, seismic, security, lighting, acoustical, chemical and biological protection, information and telecommunication, fire protection, value engineering, and vertical transportation.  The administrative coordination of the various disciplines involved, and ascertaining and working within the U.S. Government’s requirements and the applicable laws, codes and standards at the overseas project sites shall be required.  Familiarity with sustainable design through an integrated design approach is required.  Knowledge and experience in the preparation of planning, design and construction documents employing alternative methods (e.g. design-bid-build, bridging, and design-build) is required.  Design documents shall utilize AutoCAD 2005 or greater and shall be classified in accordance with the Security Classification Guide for the Design and Construction of Overseas Facilities, dated May 21, 2003. Please indicate if you have Building Information Modeling (BIM) experience and provide project examples listing BIM software experience. 

In order to be eligible to perform under this contract, the successful offeror must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DoD) Secret Facility Clearance (FCL), with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M. Personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAAs) at DoS locations must possess a Secret personnel security clearance issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). Subcontractors requiring access to classified information or CAA spaces must also possess a Secret FCL.  Offerors already possessing the necessary FCL should submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with their proposal. If a selected offeror does not possess an interim or Final Secret FCL, the Department of State will sponsor the uncleared firm for an FCL.  Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance. A period of six calendar months from the date of selection for award will be allowed for the uncleared firm to obtain the necessary FCL.  After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider awarding the contract to another firm or awarding fewer contracts.  Firms which form joint ventures must also comply with the above FCL and personnel security clearance requirements.  Each entity comprising the joint venture must be issued an FCL, as well as the joint venture.   

Firms shall be evaluated on the basis of their personnel and experience.  Experience on projects comparable to those of the Department of State shall be considered.

<SUBJECT>PHASE I SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS - BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
<SOLNBR>5MD0148-A
<RESPDATE>042409
<CONTACT>Angela C. Foster, Phone 202-719-6879, Fax 312-470-3909, Email angela.foster@am.jll.com
<DESC>GSA SFO#5MD0148
Offeror Questions and GSA Responses:

1. Do you know where the parcel is?  I am assuming it is NOT part of the contemplated Baltimore State Center which is a long-proposed 7,000,000 sq. ft.  mixed-use project which is going to contain 1,000,000 sq. ft. of government office space.

Response: The specific site for the facility is not being disclosed at this time as it is not relevant to the Phase I SFO offer and evaluation process.  The specific site will be identified in the Phase II SFO.  

2. Since will be no pre-bid conference, but can you tell me please when GSA anticipates going to Phase II, and then when they estimate they'll be able to announce an award?Also, where is the site? Will SSA be vacating the headquarters facility in Woodlawn or is this a consolidation of all the other leases in the vicinity?

Response: GSA anticipates issuing the Phase II SFO for the short-listed Offerors in July and Lease award in Dec 2009. 
See answer to question #1 regarding the site. 
See prospectus referenced in SFO para. 1.4D. for further information regarding project justification and background.  

3. Will there be any site tours or pre-proposal meetings?

Response: See answer to Question # 1 regarding site.  In accordance with section 1.2 (B) of the SFO, there will be no pre-proposal conference for Phase I. 

4. Would like to get a clarification on the number of references to make sure we do it correctly.  I believe you are looking for 3 references for each firm (Team Member as defined).  Our Architect has in-house engineering that will be doing the mechanical, electrical, structural (and thinking about blast).  How many references should we do?  3 for the firm or 6 – 3 each for the Architect and the Engineering components?

Response: We require (3) references per Team Member (firm). In the case where multiple key disciplines (Arch, M/E, Structural) are within one firm, we would require (3) references for each discipline, specifically evaluating the work of that department/discipline.
 

5.  In paragraph 2.5.A.2 of the SSA Baltimore solicitation, the government states that offerors must have experience delivering a 200,000 SF building in the last seven years.  I’m writing to ask if the government would amend that paragraph to either reduce the square footage by 7% or expand the time period to 8 years. I represent a developer with significant experience (in fact they developed the US Mint’s headquarters in downtown Washington).  We can demonstrate experience delivering a 186,000 SF building in the last 7 years; or we can demonstrate delivering a 200,000 SF building in the last 8 years.
We hope the government will amend the SFO.  We would welcome the opportunity to compete for the SSA Baltimore project.

Response: The Minimum Standard will not be revised. 

6.  Would like to know where the parcel of land is located, and the price of the assignable purchase option.

Response: See answer to question #1 regarding the site.

<DESC>Adding changes to this description to clarify evaluation phase and add business size.<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION:<BR>The Northwest Division, US Army Corps of Engineers (NWD, USACE) has developed and demonstrated a Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS) consisting of acoustic micro-transmitters (tags) and autonomous, cabled, and portable/mobile acoustic receivers for evaluating behavior and survival of juvenile salmonids migrating through the Columbia River Federal Power System (FCRPS).  Receivers have been deployed at large hydro-electric dams, free flowing sections of the FCRPS as well as the estuary of the Columbia River.  Self-contained autonomous receivers that detect, decode, and store decoded messages are typically deployed in areas within the Columbia River basin where a power source is not readily available and cable runs not feasible for a variety of reasons.  Cabled receivers detect, decode, and store decoded messages, time of arrival, and message waveforms as received on up to four hydrophones at large hydro-electric dams within the FCRPS.  Numbers of clusters form arrays that are time synchronized using time obtained from GPS receivers.  Cabled receivers are used for estimating route and time of passage including 2D and 3D position estimates for tagged fish.  Portable receivers detect, decode, store, and display transmitted signals for in laboratory transmitter testing and for displaying and entering transmitter codes at the time of tagging.  A mobile receiver consisting of a single 4 hydrophone cluster deployed from a single boat has been used to provide 2D and 3D position estimates on actively migrating tagged fish.  The USACE intends to award a 1 year with 4 option years indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity fixed-price contract for the manufacturing of the above receiver types.  In addition to manufacturing this contract will include line items for the repair and refurbishment of existing and future JSATS receivers; and support services for installation and use of each receiver type.  All functional specifications for the JSATS are government owned and will be provided in the solicitation package.  Where applicable, the design specifications and drawings for existing JSATS receivers will be provided.  Hydrophone assemblies designed specifically for JSATS receivers will be provided by the government.  This procurement action shall be conducted in two phases, an evaluation phase and a production phase.  In order to be eligible for award, and as part of the evaluation criteria, the offeror must demonstrate that their JSATS receiver meets the functional and design specifications provided in the solicitation.  The USACE will use lowest price, technically acceptable protocols for selection of up to 3 qualified firms.  These firms will be awarded contracts to enter into the evaluation phase (Phase I) of this action.  The evaluation phase shall consist of the preparation of a fully functional prototype receiver(s) that will be evaluated for performance by a USACE contractor protocols to select a single company to enter into the production phase (Phase II) of the contract.  Evaluation and rating factors will be included in the solicitation when issued.  The solicitation, Request for Proposal (RFP), outlining receiver specifications will be posted and ready for downloading on or about 29 April 2009.  The solicitation will be available via the internet at either websites; the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/default.cfm and Federal Business Opportunities https://www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>The contract is for the design, development, fabrication, and testing of specialized support equipment for the Hydraulic Power Drive Unit, a component of the V-22 Aircraft. The support equipment was procured on a sole source basis from the Bell-Boeing JPO, the OEM of the aircraft in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. The Bell-Boeing JPO is the only source possessing the requisite system knowledge, engineering expertise, aircraft integration information, and technical data needed for successful performance. A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract was issued because contractor performance risk is high due to the performance uncertainities inherent in this design/development effort.

This solicitation documents and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-26 and DFARS Change Notice 20080812.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.  The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: www.acqnet.gov/far and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dfars/index.htm.  The NAICS code ! is 423850 and the Small Business Standard is 100.

The Fleet & Industrial Supply Center Norfolk requests responses from qualified sources capable of providing items for shipboard habitability renovations in accordance with Attachment I.  Delivery is May 10th 2009; Delivery Location is MHI Shipyard, Norfolk VA.  Responsibility and Inspection:  unless otherwise specified in the order, the supplier is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements and quality control.  The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns. 
The following FAR provision and clauses are applicable to this procurement:  52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; 52.212-1 (Addendum) 1.  Past Performance Submission:  The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer.  Contractor shall complete section 3 of the attached Statement of Work for each contract.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may n! ot represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

It is the intent of the Government to initially award four (4) contracts from the Unrestricted selection and two (2) from the Small-Business Set-Aside. The Unrestricted basis is open to all interested parties regardless of business size. The Small Business size standard is a maximum of $4.5 million of average annual receipts for its preceding 3 fiscal years. All firms responding to this solicitation MUST identify in which category they are submitting. All firms must state the words (UNRESTRICTED) or (SMALL BUSINESS) after the solicitation number in PART I, A.  Block 3 of form SF 330. A separate response (SF 330) MUST be submitted for each category in which the firm wants consideration. No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation. Only firms considered highly qualified will be awarded a contract. Work under this contract is subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total IDC contract value not to exceed $10,000,000 for Unrestricted basis over the five-year life of the contract and $5,000,000 for Small-Business Set-Aside over the five-year life of the contract. A firm fixed price contract will be negotiated. Contracts awarded will not exceed a term of five years. Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged firms. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. If a large business is selected for this contract, the firm will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan during contract negotiation. The subcontracting goals for this contract are as follows: a minimum of 70.0% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB), 6.2% be placed with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), 7.0% be placed with women-owned small businesses (WOSB), 9.8% be placed with HUB Zone small business, 3.0% be placed with Veteran-Owned Small Business, (VOSB), and 0.9% be placed with Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  The selected firm will be required to perform a broad range of engineering services to satisfy fluctuating needs and conditions. Services required include assistance and guidance to Field Offices, and site visits. The majority of the work will be located in the southeastern United States; however, work may be located in any of the fifty (50) states, South or Central America, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other locations as may be assigned to the Mobile District and South Atlantic Division.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract, HSCG23-09-C-M02002, [5-Year, Base plus 4 Option Years] is to acquire technical and management services for the U.S. Coast Guard’s Recreational Boat Testing and Factory Compliance Program (RBFCP) for the Nation’s approximately 4,000 recreational boat manufacturers.  This work consists of regular testing of recreational boats that are 20 feet or less in length, associated marine equipment, and specialized boats and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States and also perform periodic visits to boat manufacturing facilities to monitor compliance with existing Federal regulations.  Boats tested may be outboard (O/B), inboard (I/B), inboard/outboard (I/O), or manually powered.  The Coast Guard does not test canoes, racing boats, airboats, or catamarans.  Areas enforced through the RBFCP include defect notifications, boat identification, safe loading, safe powering, and flotation for boats less than 20 feet in length.  The RBFCP also ensures the regulations for electrical systems, gasoline fuel systems, ventilation, start-in-gear protection, and navigation lights are also complied with.  Additionally, the RBFCP seeks to engage in educational outreach to recreational boat manufacturers, recreational boat retailers, recreational boat rental liveries, and recreational boat owners regarding current regulations and available resources.  Information collected from each factory visit is recorded and maintained in the U.S. Government owned Recreational Boating Safety database (RBSDB).  

This contract is performance based.  This contract is firm-fixed price with NTE Cost Reimbursable CLINs [00001AD-40001AD are Fixed Price and CLINs 00002AA-400002AG are NTE Cost Reimbursable].

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
