<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Health Effects Laboratory Division, Toxicology and Molecular Biology Branch, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to West Virginia University Research Corporation to supply NIOSH with brain tissue from rats subjected to precise embolic ischemic stroke so that NIOSH can conduct anatomical and biochemical analysis of brain tissue from stroked rats subject to different conditions associated with shirt work, namely loss of sleep and disrupted/fragmented sleep.</p>
<p>There are three separate studies involved in this purchase order request: one will determine how a reduction in sleep will affect the neuropathological and neurochemical consequences of ischemic stroke, a second will examine how disrupted/fragmented sleep affects the neuropathologic and neurochemical consequences of ischemic stroke, the third will examine how hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia interact with sleep deprivation and/or disrupted fragmented sleep to affect the neuropathological and neurochemical consequences of ischemic stroke. The Chronic Stress Laboratory of NIOSH will provide WVU with rats subjected to sleep deprivation or interrupted/fragmented sleep and the laboratories of Drs. Huber and Rosen will subject these experimental animals to precise embolic ischemic stroke. These studies will help NIOSH identify factors associated with shift work that may be responsible for the increased risk for ischemic stroke in shift workers.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to notify industry about an upcoming solicitation for The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) Transformation Division.

The goal of the program is to create a decision framework and an ongoing capability to align investments with operational requirements.

The USCIS Information Technology Governance (ITG) is a holistic enterprise approach representing the structure and processes of the USCIS enterprise IT capabilities and sets the technology standards and other references for the agency.

USCIS is committed to having the right enterprise services governance (ESG) in place to guide investments and provide support across the USCIS enterprise and major programs.  A critical success factor in creating a sustainable decision framework for IT investment management is having a comprehensive ITG process and Information Technology Governance Repository (ITGR). These provide the strategic view and the informational basis for leadership, governance, and management of the organizational direction to facilitate a robust, repeatable and measurable decision making process for capital investments.

<DESC>RECOVERY--THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER GSA’S ALLIANT GOVERNMENTWIDE ACQUISITION CONTRACT.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) is an unprecedented effort to jumpstart our economy, save and create millions of jobs, and put a down payment on addressing long-neglected challenges so our country can thrive in the 21st century.  ARRA is an extraordinary response to a crisis unlike any since the Great Depression.  With much at stake, ARRA provides for unprecedented levels of transparency and accountability.  As specified by ARRA Section 1526, “Board Website,” Recovery.gov is the main vehicle for providing each citizen with the ability to monitor the progress of our recovery. 

The Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB) intends to issue a solicitation for the redesign, implementation and hosting of Recovery.gov.   

Recovery.gov version 1.0 is currently hosted on a Linux server and Drupal is used for the content management system (CMS) and a MySQL database.  RATB is open to recommendations for technology improvements for version 2.0 and beyond, including the hosting platform, database technology, CMS, programming languages, etc. that facilitate satisfaction of the requirements described in this SOO.  However, the Offeror selected for this procurement will have to provide a design flexible enough to launch the new website using existing technology as well as any technological improvements suggested.  RATB strives to improve the workflow and process automation technologies that rely heavily on manual reviews of data submissions.

RATB is seeking an innovative, award winning, web-design and implementation firm with expertise on user-focused, data-driven web designs to perform complete redesign, implementation, and operation of the Recovery.gov version 2.0 website.  Design services will include visual design, user interface design, information architecture, design engineering, project management, and all expertise required to deliver a website with interactive data-visualization, and web-application level functionality.  

To this end, high-level guiding principles include the following:
Time is of the essence, as RATB is working under extremely tight deadlines for a project of this size.  Ability to move with speed and efficiency is critical.

RATB seeks to leverage existing infrastructure (hardware, software, and contracts) and relationships where practicable, and to minimize the requirement for new infrastructure to support processing and data storage for Recovery.gov. 
While emphasis is on meeting the reporting requirements specified by ARRA, RATB and its contractors understand that guidance from OMB on reporting and transparency will continue to evolve.  Specifically, the latest OMB guidance includes the following:

2.10 – “OMB plans to expand the reporting model in the future to also obtain [information from subsequent recipients beyond local governments and other organizations] once the system capabilities and processes have been established”

2.15 – “The Director…has the authority to require Federal agencies to collect information from all Federal recipients on all tiers to sub awards”

2.4 – “Reporting frequency and detail may change overtime…Agencies should begin exploring accounting and process changes required to update Obligations and Gross Outlays more frequently…”
RATB and its contractors understand that the Recovery.gov solution shall, for automation and efficiency, allow for:
1)	Evaluation of data quality to provide optimization of large, highly complex, rapidly changing data sets
2)	Automated data replication 
3)	Standardization, normalization and cleansing capabilities necessary to support robust reporting solutions overt time.
4)	Build for Speed and Responsiveness: This rapid response solution must be able to provide not only citizen-centric access but also the ability to respond to press requests, legislative branch inquires, and questions from different agencies. 
5)	Consider Information as a Service:  Focus on developing an architecture that not only provides trusted, accurate information per the OMB guidelines, but also makes the information available as a service to a wide range of people, processes and applications. 
6)	Build to support Business Optimization: Adopt a flexible, services-based architecture that delivers high-quality trusted information to set the stage for true business process optimization, and link to adjacent high-value business processes, such as fraud detection capabilities.

Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 15 June 2009. Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about June 26, 2009.  If the Government elects to conduct a Pre-Proposal Conference, details regarding the Conference will be provided in the solicitation. The solicitation will be a competitive acquisition based on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract type with optional periods of performance. There will be no public bid opening. Responses to questions emailed to the below Point of Contacts regarding this acquisition will be posted to Recovery.gov, as practicable.

This opportunity is available only to contractors who are listed on the GSA Alliant Governmentwide Acquisition Contract.   This procurement shall be conducted using competitive procedures.  Please note that to be eligible for award of this project prospective contractors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and have completed and maintained current their Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) (both can be linked to at www.bpn.gov) prior to closing date of offer. 

This is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is a solicitation available. This notice is provided for “informational purposes only” under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH

Development and Delivery Support for Online Surface Transportation Training
Potential RFP DTFH61-09-R-00028

The Federal Highway Administration is conducting market research to:

•	Determine if responsible, qualified, capable sources exist who are interested in satisfying the Government’s requirements generally described below;
•	Determine the capabilities of potential contractors, including an estimate of prices; 
•	Determine size and status of potential sources; and
•	Determine the nature of competition (i.e., 8(a), small business set-aside, or full and open)

Established by Congress in 1970, the National Highway Institute (NHI) is the training and education arm of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) under the United States Department of Transportation. NHI’s mission is to provide technical training and resource materials to the transportation community. NHI courses respond to changing workforce development requirements and provide technical professional development opportunities to a wide range of disciplines that make up the surface transportation industry. 

The NHI plans to award multiple 5-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for the development/update and online support of training courses in the broad area of Surface Transportation. The work requires skilled, knowledgeable and experienced instructional systems designers and technologists (ISD), graphic artists, and digital multimedia specialists that will be partnered with Government-provided subject matter experts (SMEs) to develop new curriculum materials and to update existing course materials for appropriate distance learning formats. 

The majority of current NHI offerings are instructor-led training (ILT) within a classroom setting.  But to meet the time and budget challenges of customers and reach as many participants as possible, NHI espouses distance learning options, which presently include Web-Based Training (WBT), Web Conference Training (WCT), blended learning, and Web 2.0 technologies as opportunities arise.

The ID/IQ solicitation will involve multiple awards for distance learning developments and delivery support services. For WBT, WCT and blended courses in addition to ISDs, the contractor team must include web training specialists including graphics artists, digital media experts, and flash programmers.  

NHI has been approved as an Authorized Provider by the International Association for Continuing Education and Training (IACET), 1760 Old Meadow Road, Suite 500, McLean, VA 22102.  Since 2004, NHI has awarded Continuing Education Units (CEUs) to participants who successfully complete selected NHI training courses. One CEU is equivalent to ten contact hours of training. For those whose jobs require Professional Development Hours (PDHs), each hour of an NHI training session can be translated into one PDH. Additionally, several NHI courses are approved for state licensure programs and others serve as prerequisites for state certification curricula.

The target audience for NHI courses is very broad, and includes staff from Federal, State and local transportation and resource agencies; Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers; as well as tribal government representatives, academia, and consultants involved with transportation issues. The NHI Web site—http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/--  provides a listing of current training courses, as well as information on resources, training philosophy, instructor standards, the NHI Style and Standards Guide and many other related topics.   

NHI’s goal is to optimize training for maximum effectiveness, ensuring that the greatest amount of learning takes place within certain defined constraints. Part of this process involves developing course materials precisely targeted to participant needs and providing clearly articulated Learning Outcomes.  The principles of adult learning and ISD must be incorporated into the curriculum materials, as well as an end of course learning assessment (i.e. exam, skill demonstration, etc) in order to be consistent with IACET requirements.  Training typically includes a combination of instructional strategies designed to provide the proper context, allow the learner to be actively engaged and in control of their learning, allow time for reflection on the implications of content, as well as provide a social venue to question and learn from others. 

Since the NHI training program is national in scope, individual course developments are designed according to the NHI Style and Standards Guide and designated FHWA Program Office input. The contractor is expected to provide interactions and flexibility into the course design that allows the participant to achieve the required outcomes as well as provide opportunities to locate and assimilate additional related information.

Highly qualified, experienced and knowledgeable instructors have been the hallmark of NHI training courses. To be truly effective in an online environment, synchronous training requires skilled, competent, and credible instructors supported by an individual skilled in using the features and functions of the synchronous classroom.

From time to time, those awarded an ID/IQ contract will be invited to compete for award of task orders that may also include other functions relating to training development and delivery, such as needs assessment, marketing, electronic formatting for Section 508 compliance, studies to determine alternate delivery formats and recommendations.  

Performance under the Task Orders is subject to the requirements of Section 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in 1998. Section 504 deals with accessibility for all participants in training classes. Section 504 specifically addresses classroom settings, course materials and accommodations for special needs. Section 508 addresses accessibility issues relative to electronic media such as web postings, web sites, computer simulations, and videos. 

The NHI follows Section 504/508 Compliance in all of its training development and delivery efforts. The NHI and its contractors must, to the greatest degree possible, meet all accessibility needs of its participants. 
Examples and access to current NHI distance learning course offerings may be found on the NHI Web site home page, under the Web course section.

<DESC>The intent of this contract is to provide for heavy road maintenance of forest roads on the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.  The roads are located on the Snoqualmie Ranger District (North Bend and Enumclaw areas) and the Skykomish Ranger District.  Heavy Road Maintenance is considered storm damaged sites that did not qualify under the Emergency Relief for Federal Owned Roads (ERFO) or deferred maintenance. This will be considered routine maintenance within the existing road prism. Existing road will be rebuilt to its approved traffic service level or will be improved to increase safety, operational efficiency or resource protection. Reconstruction includes rebuilding roads to their original standards. All road reconstruction plans, standards and specifications will provide for minimum needed road width, drainage and safe operation while incorporating measures for mitigating for resource disturbances. The overall existing condition of roads to be reconstructed is generally inadequate for resource protection or anticipated use or the road is impassable for the design of the vehicle. The majority of this contract will entail spot reconstruction where the primary disturbance is confined to a limited area, such as culvert installation, rock buttress and embankment repairs, mitigating subsurface water problem areas, rebuilding a shoulder or addition of turnouts. Areas between the reconstructed spots generally will need reconditioning (which includes but is not limited to; reshaping and processing the road surface, ditches, brushing the shoulders and treating danger trees). Most of the reconstruction and reconditioning is actually maintenance to restore the road to its original condition. District maps showing the road systems are available for viewing and/or purchase at the district offices in North Bend and Skykomish.  Estimated issue date for the solicitation is on or about June 25, 2009.  Estimated start work date is August 1, 2009 with a duration of 1080 days.  The project is 100% set aside for HubZone small business concerns.

The resulting contract will be a performance based Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery contract with a minimum guarantee of $300,000.00 and a maximum not to exceed $999,000.00.  Roads will be identified on work orders for the Contractor.  Level 3-5 roads will be maintained to passenger car driveability and meet the Highway Safety Act stndards.  Level 2 roads will be pasable with a 4x4 vehicle.  The Contractor shall start work when directed within three calendar days from the date of the work order.  The technical contact is Ron Hausinger at 425-888-1421 x257.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the fabrication ofdetector module subassemblies (DMS) each consisting of an infrared sensor chip assembly(SCA), thermal isolation cable and sensor cold electronics (SCE) to meet the requirementsof the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM).  The JDEM is a jointly funded and developedmission by NASA and the Department of Energy (DOE) and is a space-based, medium aperture,wide field, optical telescope with near-infrared (NIR) imaging and spectroscopicinstrumentation.  JDEM will survey the sky to accurately measure the magnitude andredshift of a large sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), spectroscopic redshifts of alarge sample of galaxies for Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) studies, and accurateshape parameters and photometric redshift measurements of a large sample of galaxies forWeak Lensing (WL) studies.  The Telescope Assembly portion of the observatory is expectedto be a Three Mirror Anastigmat (TMA) with 3 tertiary mirrors that will provide theoptical train to the Government developed JDEM instrument (3 focal planes and a fineguidance sensor).  The JDEM telescope is expected to have a primary mirror size of ~1.5meters in diameter and operate at a temperature up to 293 Kelvin.  NASA contemplates building an Engineering Development Unit (EDU) focal plane and needs aset of detector module subassemblies to populate it as well as a set of cryogenic readoutelectronics for control and data handling.  The objectives of the EDU focal plane are toassess our ability to assemble and align multiple, close-packed detector modulesubassemblies into a mosaic array, remove and replace SCAs without disturbingneighboring SCAs, assess performance of the DMS over the operating temperature range,and assess the ability of the EDU focal plane to withstand the dynamic launchenvironment. NASA seeks a complement of detector module subassemblies in accordance withour preliminary specification.	The specification requirements were developed as part ofour assessment of scientific and mission requirements for JDEM.     The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 334413 and 500, respectively.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about June 26, 2009 with an anticipatedoffer due date of on or about July 27, 2009.An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over theInternet.

<p>The FedBizOpps staff is not authorized to determine the classification code for any FedBizOpps notice. Because a misclassified contract action fails to notify the firms most likely to respond and therefore may violate the Competition in Contracting Act, the contracting officer is held responsible for correctly classifying a FedBizOpps notice. A misclassified contract action must be corrected and re-synopsized in the FedBizOpps. Detailed classification codes are available on the FedBizOpps website at: http://www.FedBizOpps.gov/.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY  – PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE

RECOVERY - TWO DISTINCT VECTOR NETWORK ANALYZER (VNA) BASED SYSTEMS  

THIS PROJECT IS BEING FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. This pre-solicitation notice is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.704. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology-Boulder (NIST Boulder) requires two distinct vector network analyzer (VNA) based systems.  

The first system will be used for precise rf/microwave/mm wave network analysis measurements as well as support for other fundamental measurement capabilities. This will include connectorized measurements based on coaxial and waveguide transmission lines and on-wafer measurements.  This system will need to cover the frequency range of 10 MHz to 750 GHz.  NIST Boulder requirements for the system include two identically configured four-port 50 GHz VNAs and one set (pair) of frequency extension heads, for full two-port scattering parameter measurements, to use with the VNAs sufficient to cover 110 GHz to 750 GHz without any gaps in frequency coverage.  This will give us the maximum flexibility and configuration to support high frequency, nonlinear and multi-port measurements.  

The second system requires two (2) network analyzer systems that will be used as antenna measurement receivers, coaxial test and measurement systems, and general-purpose RF network analyzers.  These proposed systems will cover our current measurement range of 1 GHz to 110 GHz and extend coverage up to 500 GHz with the foresight of looking at extending our capabilities to 1 THz in the future.  We require a four-port analyzer at 50 GHz to allow for maximum flexibility and configuration for future applications. These systems will be delivered with calibration kits and other support hardware that will be common to the two systems.  The two network analyzers (nwa) required for this system and the accompanying extension modules will replace outdated radio frequency (rf) equipment at NIST with state of the art systems that are required to support standards and calibration services.   Equipment advances over this timeframe provide increased accuracy with better measurement speed and stability as well as the ability to extend the measurement frequency range to 500 GHz.   Current measurement capabilities provide calibration services and research opportunities from 2 to 110 GHz.  Acquisition of this new measurement equipment will extend this frequency range to 500 GHz.  This extension of calibration services to the higher frequency bands is paramount in meeting government and private industry needs, including (but not limited to) measurement support for climate monitoring and communications.  

Delivery terms shall be FOB DESTINATION.  The delivery schedule shall be stated in the request for quotation.  

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is being procured using full & open competition.  This requirement is not set-aside for small business.

Simplified Acquisition Procedures shall be utilized under the authority of FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.

Potential Offerors will be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted.

<DESC>RECOVERY – PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE

RECOVERY - COMPUTER NUMERICALLY CONTROLLED (CNC) HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL MILLING MACHINES

THIS PROJECT IS BEING FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. This pre-solicitation notice is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.704. 
 
The NAICS code for this requirement is 333512 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.  In accordance with the Non-Manufacturer Rule, to qualify under a small business set-aside, the distributor and the manufacturer must qualify as a Small Business under the NAICS code identified above.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) Horizontal and Vertical Milling Machines. The CNC Milling Machines use various types of cutting tools to precisely mill through materials to create the desired high precision dimensional features. The CNC Milling Machines will be used for manufacturing and fabrication support services provided by the Fabrication Technology Division (FTD) of NIST. 

A milling machine is a machine tool used for the shaping of metal and other solid materials. Its basic form is that of a rotating cutter which rotates about the spindle axis, and a table to which the work piece is affixed. The milling operation involves movement of the rotating cutter sideways as well as 'in and out'. The cutter and work piece move relative to each other, generating a tool path along which material is removed. The movement is precisely controlled, usually with slides and lead screws or analogous technology. Often the movement is achieved by moving the table while the cutter rotates in one place, but regardless of how the parts of the machine slide; the result that matters is the relative motion between cutter and work piece. Milling machines may be manually operated, mechanically automated, or digitally automated via computer control. Various machine sizes are being requested because of space limitation at various shop locations on the NIST campus where the machines will be installed has limited space capacity.

The FTD provides a wide range of engineering, fabrication and technical services to support the creation of unique measurement instruments and scientific apparatus needed by researchers in the NIST's Measurement and Standards Laboratories. FTD provides the mission critical engineering and manufacturing expertise and equipment needed to produce specialized parts and subassemblies for the extraordinary variety of one-of-a-kind instruments conceived by NIST scientists and engineers. 

FTD’s primary line of service is metal fabrication, mechanical engineering, and electromechanical assembly. This service is used to engineer and fabricate high precision components and assemblies for use in one-of-a-kind measurement instruments conceived by NIST scientist and engineers.  FTD depends on its installed base of manufacturing technology to support the many service needs of its customers. This manufacturing technology base includes a full family of automated and conventional milling machines, lathes, grinders, electrical discharge machines, boring mills and other related manufacturing equipment. This acquisition is necessary to maintain and upgrade our CNC milling capabilities, replace manual machines that are costly to repair and to improve the efficiency of preparing detailed parts on CNC milling machines.

Delivery terms shall be FOB DESTINATION.  The delivery schedule shall be stated in the request for quotation.  

Simplified Acquisition Procedures shall be utilized under the authority of FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.

Potential Offerors will be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis; TaqMan Assay (TA) systems which include: assay systems to detect very low levels of mRNAs and miRNAs; supporting ancillary reagents; reverse transcription reagents; upgrades to government owned Applied Biosystems 7900HT instruments; and data analysis software from Applied Biosystems, part of Life Technologies; 850 Lincoln Centre Drive; Foster City, California 94404. 

The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.5.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

The NCI CCR has a need for the TaqMan Array (TA) systems for nucleic acid quantification down to single cell. The areas of research include ovarian cancer, ABC drug transport models, metastasis, liver carcinogenesis, viral hepatitis-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis, cancer stem cell research, leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and others. The major goal of this project is to extend the research capabilities of the NCI in the area of profiling gene and miRNA expression.
  
The TA systems provides quantification of mRNA and microRNA at low sample input, enabling the ability to analyze 10-384 gene targets and signatures for any gene in model organisms and practically any sample type.  

Applied Biosystems is the only source known to NCI that can provide the aforementioned TA systems that are required to meet the needs of the NCI CCR. TaqMan Arrays provided by Applied Biosystems are the only known real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) arrays demonstrated to meet NCI needs to analyze complex and challenging samples with real time PCR sensitivity and specificity that could not previously be analyzed, due to limited amount of samples and; is the only source known that can detect expression down to the single-cell level.  The Array technology is a unique, microfluidic technology that provides the ability to analyze 12-384 genes on the “gold standard” TaqMan chemistry.  In addition, the products required by the NCI are known to be available solely by AB as they hold patent rights and exclusive licenses specific to each product category. These products and assays are consistent with NCI’s existing instrumentation, AB 7900 HT Thermal Cycling System with a low density array block to perform the analysis of TaqMan Arrays.  

Period of Performance shall be for from award through twelve (12) months, with two (2) option periods.  In addition, this is a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract.  Only one (1) award will be made as a result of this notice.

This is not a request for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above supplies, it may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above specifications described herein. Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 11:00 AM ET on June 22, 2009. If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax - 301 402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

No collect calls will be accepted.

<CONTACT>Austin Sachs, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-435-0345, Fax 301-480-3430, Email sachsa@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) anticipates that request for proposals (RFP) NHLBI-HG-10-01 will be available on or about Monday, June 8, 2009. This project, solicited on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), is named the Laboratory, Data Analysis and Coordination Center (LDACC). It is a component of a larger project named the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). The GTEx project objective is to provide the scientific community a resource with which to study human gene expression and regulation and its relationship to genetic variation. This project will collect and analyze multiple human tissues from donors who are also densely genotyped, to assess genetic variation within their genomes. By analyzing global RNA expression within individual tissues and treating the expression levels of genes as quantitative traits, variations in gene expression that are highly correlated with genetic variation can be identified as expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs. 

Despite the rapid progress achieved using genome-wide association studies to identify genetic changes associated with common human diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, asthma, and stroke, a large majority of these genetic changes lies outside of the protein-coding regions of genes and often even outside of the genes themselves, making it difficult to discern which genes are affected and by what mechanism. The comprehensive identification of human eQTLs will greatly help to identify genes whose expression is affected by genetic variation and will provide a valuable basis on which to study the mechanism of that gene regulation.

The GTEx project is a 2.5 year pilot with the primary goal of testing the feasibility of collecting high-quality RNA and DNA from multiple tissues from approximately 160 donors identified through low post-mortem interval autopsy or organ transplant settings. For a small subset of tissues, collection from living surgery patients will also be performed to compare to the autopsy-derived tissues. If the pilot phase proves successful, the project will be scaled up to involve approximately 1,000 donors. 

The project will also involve consultation and research into the ethical, legal and social issues raised by the research, support for statistical methods development, and creation of a database to house existing and GTEx-generated eQTL data. The database will allow users to view and download computed eQTL results and to provide a controlled access system for de-identified individual-level genotype, expression, and clinical data. The associated tissue repository will also serve as a resource for many additional kinds of analyses.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS; See: http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies) have shown great promise in identifying genetic loci associated with common human diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.  Despite this progress, the majority of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other genetic changes significantly associated with phenotype, lie outside of the protein-coding regions of genes and often even outside of the genes themselves.  This makes it difficult to discern which genes underlie the association signals and by what mechanism.  This Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, an NIH Roadmap Initiative (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx), aims to provide this information.  

A cost reimbursement completion type contract with one or more priced options is anticipated.  This will be awarded under full and open competition as a negotiated acquisition. The LDACC is anticipated to be awarded on or about 5/07/2010. The NHLBI anticipates awarding a contract based on technical merit and funds availability.

This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP) and, although one award is anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://fedbizopps.gov.  Prospective Offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments. It is also the Offerors’ responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of any amendments to the RFP. The RFP will contain all the information and details to allow potential Offerors to prepare and submit a contract proposal. This acquisition has been designated as a full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541711.  Subcontracting opportunities are anticipated during the course of this contract award.

NOTE:  PREPARATION COSTS – This presolicitation notice does not commit the Government to pay for preparation and submission of any materials.  The NHLBI is a consolidated Office of Acquisitions and serves as the R&D buyer for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) as well as five (5) other Institutes and Centers of the NIH.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA plans to procure on an other than full and open competition basis from MicroCell Corporation, 6003 CHAPEL HILL RD STE 153, RALEIGH, NC, 27607, a one (1)kW Microfiber-based Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell system.  The key performance objective of the proposed contract is to provide a 1kW microfiber-based PEM fuel cell system.  Selected operational parameters will be monitored, recorded, and analyzed by the Government over a time period yet to be determined.  Using the manufacturing process, all the components of a single fuel cell (the electro-catalyst of cathode and anode, the polymer electrolyte membrane, and the current collector) are extruded into a single microfiber.  As the speed of the extrusion line is increased, it is important that no bottlenecks occur in the subsequent processes.  Material and manufacturing costs are too high for fuel cell components and the Government believes low-cost, high-volume manufacturing processes are necessary to reduce costs.  The expected outcome of the expansion is the acceleration of fuel cell technology and process development for mass production of cost-efficient fuel ce! lls for commercial and non-commercial applications.  Delivery is expected 365 days after receipt of contract award.  Responsible sources having the capability to deliver the product described above or a similar acceptable product may submit an offer which will be considered to:  Commander NAWCWD, Attn: Chris Thompson, Contracts Department, Code 254200D, NAVAIRWARCENWPNDIV, 429 E. Bowen Rd, China Lake, CA 93555 or via e-mail to: chris.thompson1@navy.mil.  The offer must have complete and detailed information that includes all physical specifications of the fuel cell system, including size and output; an outline of previous successful fuel cell demonstrations or commercial applications including specific products in microfiber-based technology; and any other available descriptive literature.

<SUBJECT>J--INLS Side Connector Overhaul and Repair
<SOLNBR>N0002509R0003
<RESPDATE>072709
<ARCHDATE>07272009

<DESC>Naval Facilities (NAVFAC) Sealift Support Program Office (SSPO) has a requirement for the overhaul and repair of Side Connectors, Remote Hydraulic Carts and 8ft X 8ft X 20ft ISO 668 containers. The overhaul and repair will take place at the contractor's facility.
The Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS) Side Connector System consists of two major assemblies: the INLS Side Connector (SC) and the Remote Hydraulic Cart. The main purpose of the SC is to provide a means of connecting INLS Combination Modules (CMs) side-by-side to form a rigid connection. The connectors mate with female pockets located on the side of each CM when engaged. The connectors are designed to be capable of operation through Sea State 2 and survive in Sea State 4.
The SC is a two-trapezoidal box structure which houses four bullets at top and four at bottom for connection. These eight bullets work in pairs and are moved inward or outward by hydraulic cylinders with controls at the top of the connector. Each bullet engages with a female socket that conforms to the shape of the bullet. Female sockets are cast in the CMs. The objective is to use four side connectors to hold two CMs together side-to-side. For each connector, all eight bullets engage the female sockets forming a rigid joint. The hydraulic power is supplied via flexible quick disconnect hoses that connect to the top of each SC. 
The Remote Hydraulic Cart provides the means to hydraulically power and electrically monitor the connector operation. The Remote Hydraulic Cart receives 3000 psi hydraulic pressure from a separate hydraulic power unit to a hose connection into the back of the Remote Hydraulic Cart. Electrical power (24 VDC) is provided via a generator located in the crew shelter and cabling into the back of the Remote Hydraulic Cart.
The wheeled Remote Hydraulic Cart houses a mobile multifaster, remote control station, electrical interface box, manifold assembly, gage panel and floodlight. The mobile multifaster is designed to mate with the hydraulic and electrical connections on the connector's fixed multifaster. The remote control station contains the operator controls and indicators for operation of the connector. The remote control station is operated via a hand held tethered remote. The manifold has five solenoid operated valves (one for circulation of fluid and four for supply/return to the connector cylinders). The gauge panel is provided with four pressure gauges, one for each of the side connector lines.
The electrical interface box is mounted on the rear side of the Remote Hydraulic Cart. The box provides connections for the incoming hydraulic and electrical power. Also contained in the box is a programmable relay module that receives inputs from the side connector cylinder sensors and the remote control station, and provides outputs to the solenoid valves and the remote control station status indicators. The electrical interface box also contains a proportional valve controller module that receives inputs from the remote control station operator control, and outputs to the hydraulic proportional valve that is located with the Hydraulic Power Unit (HPU).
The SCs and Remote Hydraulic Cart are shipped and stored in 20-foot long ISO containers. The containers contain pallets, strapping material and safety chains required to keep the SCs secure while in transit. The ISO containers can be shipped via commercial means. 
Principle features of the work will include the following: 
Side Connectors:
- Unload eight SCs, each weighing 4760 lbs, out of the ISO containers.- Electrically, hydraulically, mechanically test SCs.- Repair/Replace items as necessary on SCs.- Brush blast entire assembly then repaint.- Create label plates out of Stainless Steel and affix to SCs.-Update 20 SCs by putting 8 bullets per SC on lathe to meet dimensional requirement.
ISO Containers:
- ISO containers shall be inspected for conformance to ABS rules of certification for cargo containers.- Examine for any missing lashing hardware in the ISO Containers.- Examine for rust/holes in ISO Containers.- Repair and Repaint ISO containers as necessary. 
Remote Hydraulic Carts:- Electrically, hydraulically, mechanically test remote hydraulic carts.- Repair/Replace items as necessary remote hydraulic carts.- Repaint remote hydraulic carts as necessary.
The contractor shall establish storage space for depot level material and three ISO containers at their facility during the length of the contract. The Government will access these materials and containers as needed.
This is a new procurement; it does not replace an existing contract. 
Offerors will be able to view/ download the solicitation at https://www.neco.navy.mil/ when it is posted.

<DESC>The objective of the Education Administration Program in Georgia is to address chronic education needs in Georgia, USAID/Caucasus proposes a new 3-year Education Management Project with the expected result of building management capacity in the education sector through establishment of an education management training program for administrators supported by necessary financial and administrative policy reforms.  The approximate amount of the award will be between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 and program implementation is estimated to begin in January 2009.  

The Education Management Project will have two objectives:

1. Improve the long-term institutional capacity of Georgia to better manage the education system and lead its transformation;  and,

2. Ensure the effectiveness of education policies on management, finance, and accreditation through support to the Ministry of Education and Science, MES educational agencies, and ERCs.

Successful completion of the program scope of work components will result in the establishment of a strong Master’s of Education Administration degree program as well as short-term training programs at Ilia Chachavadze University.  Graduates from these programs will have the necessary management skills needed to improve administration and educational quality in their institutions.  National policies on school management and decentralization will be refined to allow for more effective regional planning and decision-making and greater resource availability for schools.  The Ministry of Education will be able to base its decisions on more reliable national, regional, and school level data as well as through participatory discussions with the civil society organizations and local communities.  University education quality will be improved through the adoption of internationally recognized standards in the accreditation of university programs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment intends to negotiate with The Legal Action Center (LAC) on a sole source basis.

The Legal Action Center is the only non-profit law and policy organization in the United States whose sole mission is to fight discrimination against people with histories of addiction, HIV/AIDS, or criminal records, and to advocate for sound public policies in these areas.  For three decades, LAC has worked to combat the stigma and prejudice that keep these individuals out of the mainstream of society. The LAC is committed to helping people reclaim their lives, maintain their dignity, and participate fully in society as productive, responsible citizens. 

The goal of the acquisition is to partner with The Legal Action Center’s HIRE Component to conduct a 12-month project to develop and conduct regional trainings to assist SAMHSA/CSAT and its grantees in strengthening their partnerships with the workforce development networks in their communities, along with Department of Justice and Department of Labor grantees, to fulfill the Administration’s goal to increase public safety by addressing the reentry of formerly incarcerated individuals around the nation.  

The anticipated period of performance is one (1) year from date of award.

The acquisition will be conducted using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, via a written request for quotation and the anticipated award date is July 6, 2009. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency and shall be submitted prior to the closing of this presolicitation to the point of contact identified herein.

<DESC><p>****FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY****</p>
<p>This notice is provided for informational purposes only.  This project is being procured via the e-Buy system on the Federal Supply Schedule.  All contractors under SIN 412 52 &ndash; Power Systems Engineering Support are eligible to submit a proposal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RECOVERY :  Advanced Metering System &ndash; GSA, Great Lakes Region</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy and Security and Independence Act of 2007, the General Services Administration is implementing advanced metering of electric, water, natural gas, and district steam/chilled water throughout the country.  This project will be partially funded by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 (ARRA) in order to meet with President Obama&rsquo;s plan put money back into the economy.  
Advanced metering and advanced metering systems are defined as follows: an electric meter, new or appropriately retrofitted, which is 1) capable of measuring and recording usage data in time differentiated registers, including hourly or such interval as is specified by regulatory authorities, 2) allows electric consumers, suppliers and service providers to participate in all types of price-base demand response programs, and 3) which provides other data and functionality that address power quality and other electricity service issues.
The work for this project will be done throughout Region 5.  Region 5 states include:  Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.  
The intent of this project is to provide advanced metering to forty-six buildings in Region 5.</p>
<p>To accomplish this goal, GSA intends to separate this work into three phases.  Phase One will include Project Development and Project Management.  The Project Development portion will involve the creation of specifications in order to have a contractor install meters at the buildings listed in the Request for Quote.  This will allow for GSA to procure for Meter Installation services (Phase Two).  The Project Management portion will involve the oversight of the installation by the installation contractor awarded to by GSA.  The awardee of Phase One will be excluded from bidding on Phase Two of this project.</p>
<p>Phase Two will include the Meter Installation by a separate contractor.  The Phase Two contractor will be chosen by GSA by the utilization of the specifications created by the Phase One contractor.</p>
<p>Phase Three will include Software Integration using ION/EEM Software mandated by Central Office.</p>
<p>PHASE ONE WORK IS BEING PROCURED UNDER THIS ACTION ONLY.</p>

ARCHITECTURAL EVALUATION AND DESIGN FOR A CHAIN ANCHOR SYSTEM.

<DESC>The USGS, Upper Midwest Environmental Science Center (UMESC), LaCrosse, Wisconsin requires a firm-fixed price Architect/Engineering services for design and construction of an anchor system for the research vessel (R/V) KIYI.
The KIYI is a 107 foot steel hulled ship built in 1999, by Patti Shipyard, Pensacola, Florida, and is used for fishery research on Lake Superior.  The KIYI is an Un-inspected Public Vessel that is owned by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  The KIYI is managed and operated by the Lake Superior Biological Station, with a home port of Ashland, Wisconsin.  The vessel has a 27 foot beam, 10 foot navigational draft and has a gross tonnage of approximately 280.  The vessel normally operates from April through November on the open and near shore waters of Lake Superior.  The KIYI travels to various ports, and can accommodate a crew of four and a scientific staff of five for up to two weeks.
This SOW concerns the architectural evaluation and design of a chain anchor system, with capstan, and design of a bullnose and mooring fittings in the bow.
The wire anchor system that was installed aboard KIYI during initial construction is inadequate due to its lightweight, light duty character.  The R/V Kiyi routinely anchors overnight due to limited number of ports available for dockage in the area of operations on Lake Superior.  The anchor often drags, putting the vessel and crew in danger of running aground, and it fouls easily, placing the crew in unsafe positions to clear it.  Components of the system have been damaged due to the design.  The entire anchor system should be replaced with a heavy duty chain system to increase efficiency and safety.  This project will require modifications to the vessel structure and deck machinery and could affect the vessel's structure and stability.  This project must be thoroughly evaluated and designed by a naval architect.  
The mooring kingposts on either side of the bow often do not provide enough lateral strain to keep the bow from drifting off the pier.  Also, there is no capstan to provide tension on the mooring line.

Technical Requirements
 The Architect-Engineer shall perform all services described herein in accordance with the work requirements.  Specific tasks required are: a.  Preliminary investigations. b.  Preparation of detailed plans and specifications for the removal of existing anchoring system and construction of new anchor system.c.  Provide breakdown of estimates for quantities and costs. d Consultation and advice during construction phase.e.Preparation of As-Built Drawings at completion of construction.
It is anticipated that award for the A&E portion of the project will be made on our about July 15th, 2009. Design work must be completed within 60 days after award is made. 
In accordance with FAR 36.204 the magnitude of the construction project is estimated to be between $250,000 and $500,000. The construction portion of the project will begin in early Spring 2009. 

Pursuant to FAR Subpart 19.1002, award will be issued as an Emerging Small-Business Set-Aside. The NAICS code for this project is 541330. Potential contractors must be registered in CCR (www.ccr.gov) at the time of submission of their qualifications in order to be considered for an award. 
Firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit one copy of a completed SF330 Parts I and II - Architect-Engineer Qualifications to include brief resumes of key personnel expected to have major responsibilities for the project (SF 330 is available at http://www.gsa.gov/portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary).

<DESC>Interested parties shall submit a capability statement along with company profile.  Please submit your response to Henry Fox, Contract Specialist at henry.fox@va.gov.  Contact number is 708-786-7744.The Government requires a Electrical Distribution System (EDS) that is a portable, free-standing power system designed to distribute 33kva of 120VAC temporary power to various areas of a deployed 250 patient Federal medical station (FMS) during emergency response operations. The EDS shall provide power for health care related functions and as such must satisfy legal requirements for temporary health care facility electrical systems.  The EDS shall provide 120VAC power to each patient bed and 120VAC to the administration, support, pharmacy, technical support, holding, common, treatment areas and nurses' stations areas.  The EDS shall comply with the latest versions of the National Fire Protection Standard NFPA 99 for Health Care Installations and the National Electric Code (NEC), including requirements for temporary installations and life safety issues. The EDS shall be able to utilize, as its power source, either multiple 120VAC circuits, or one or two facility 208/120VAC 3-phase power sources, or one 40-amp 480VAC 3-phase power source (generator or utility).  The primary EDS components include:"	extension cord sets specifically designed to minimize the number of cables and setup time for delivering power to every patient bed and FMS workspace;"	six local 208 Volt 3-phase to 120 Volt distribution boxes;"	cables to route both 120 Volt and 3 phase power into the FMS deployment space;"	a main power distribution/transformer cart; and"	an automatic transfer switch to select one of two outdoor power sources (utility drop or rental generator supplied by others).The EDS shall be man-portable and/or wheeled or containerized such that it can be quickly moved into the host facilities, un-packed and assembled. It shall also use designs, controls, and connectors that will ensure rapid and correct installation without the presence of an electrician (except for connecting to three phase power sources).  Typical examples of components required for health care applications but not typically included in temporary power systems include hospital grade tamper proof outlets and GFCI protection on all outlets with lockout provisions on loss of power that require manual breaker action to reset.The contractor will assemble, pack and deliver the components into three types of kits.  Component items will be arranged by kit, packed/palletized and labeled in accordance with a prescribed protocol.  Each container/pallet shall have a packing list to identify items and a lot number configured as follows:  MFG abbrev.(3 letters)/G.1/Mo./D./Yr., where G.1. is the latest revision of the FMS program baseline requirements and Mo/D/Yr is the date the kit was assembled.The contractor will deliver assembled and packed kits in accordance with the following schedule:-	EDS Kit 1:  21 per month beginning 45 days after contract award Total quantity - 360. -	EDS Kit 2:  10 delivered 45 days following contract award.-	                   10 delivered 60 days following contract award.-	                   20 delivered 90 days following contract award (Total Kit 2 quantity - 40)-	EDS Kit 3: 10 delivered 60 days following contract award (Total Kit 3 quantity - 10)-	EDS Kit 3, Augmentation items: 10 delivered 90 days following contract award.The EDS component items shall be packed in Shuert Uni-Pak containers or equal.  Kits 1 and 2 shall be packed using the 48x40 "tall" pallets, with fold down side panels for access.  Kit 3 shall be packed using a 48x40 "short" pallet.

<DESC>COLT - Common Organizational Level Tester
This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. There is no solicitation available at this time.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for Market Research purposes only.  This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for Interim Contractor Support (ICS) for the Common Organizational Level Tester (COLT).  The COLT is a multiple application-based tester that will allow Air Force maintainers to perform maintenance tasks to verify the operational capability of aircraft armament and stores management systems/subsystems and armament components.  It includes the tester unit, ancillary equipment, and related software programs, data and documentation.  The COLT, in conjunction with the applicable peculiar Test Program Set (TPS), performs (depending on the TPS) Organizational-level (O-level) and, in some cases, Intermediate level (I-level) functional checks, fault detection, and fault isolation to the Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) and/or Shop ! Replaceable Unit (SRU) level.  The COLT is an Air Force armament tester for the F-22 and B-2 programs.
The COLT was developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation - Lockheed Martin Simulation, Training & Support (LM STS) in Orlando, Florida who is currently the prime contractor for the COLT.  
We are currently on contract with LM STS for COLT ICS.  If other sources for ICS are not found as a result of this market research synopsis, three additional option years of ICS will be added to the existing contract with LM STS.
LM STS currently has the only set of unique test equipment, called the Verification Test Suite (VTS), which is needed to verify the nuclear surety of the COLT system after repair, of each COLT.  This VTS was designed and developed by LM STS at no cost to the government, and the hardware and software comprising the VTS is proprietary to LM STS.   LM STS designed and developed the VTS using its own capital funding.  The Government did not purchase rights to technical data for the Verification Test Suite (VTS).  A COLT technical data package does not provide the technical data required by a new source to repair the current inventory of COLT units.  Because of the Nuclear Certification requirements of the B-2, the VTS was developed to insure the external interface of the COLT was maintained within specifications.  This process/procedure was included in the Nuclear Certification process as part of the Nuclear Safety Analysis Report (NSAR) that has already been approved by the Air!  Force Safety Center.  If a new source were to develop a "VTS-like" capability, then a new NSAR and recertification would be necessary, according to the Air Force Safety Center.
Interested parties are invited to submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) to the Government for evaluation in response to this announcement.  Information submitted must be pertinent and specific and cover the following areas:
1.  Experience:  Provide an outline of previous projects or specific work performed or being performed and any in-house ICS efforts (including a brief description of how these referenced efforts relate to the COLT).

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
Pursuant to FAR 15.201(e)

U.S. Forest Service 

The United States Forest Service, Washington Office, Acquisition Management, Information Technology (IT) Support Branch is requesting information from interested offerors who can lease of high definition video-conferencing equipment to  the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for seven (7) locations.  Proposed lease period is 12 months with two one-year optional periods. The IT Support Branch is conducting market research to gain an understanding of the capabilities and qualifications that exist in the marketplace as well as to finalize an acquisition strategy.  Please refer to the draft list of equipment and services.  
Telepresence Video Conferencing Requirements

USDA’s Goal: To acquire a turn-key solution to support seven, high-definition telepresence endpoints. The system must support point-to-point and multipoint conference calls between multiple telepresence endpoints, audio-only participants (PSTN/ISDN), legacy Tandberg, H323 standards-based, and Office Communicator 2007 R1 audio/video endpoints in the same conference. Telepresence endpoints must support data collaboration capabilities.

Locations for the 7 telepresence endpoints are 2 in Washington, D.C. and one each in St. Louis, MO; Kansas City, MO; Fort Collins, CO; New Orleans, LA and Albuquerque, NM. 
If any centralized components are to be hosted at the USDA, they will be deployed in either the USDA Kansas City, MO or St. Louis, MO data center facilities. 

Network Connectivity:
USDA wishes to connect each telepresence endpoint directly to the USDA managed Customer Edge Routers (CERs) that provide connectivity to the custom MPLS network backbone, the Universal Telecommunications Network (UTN).   This design is believed to provide the best possible connection for higher bandwidth consuming devices.  A diagram of the USDA UTN backbone is provided at the end of this document for your reference Figure 1- Universal Telecommunications Network (USDA Backbone).

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)Feasibility of using Constellation Architecture for Servicing Existing and FutureObservatory-Class Scientific SpacecraftAstrophysics Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASAGeneral Information:Solicitation Number:		NNH09ZDA010LRelease Date:			June 10, 2009Response Date:		August 10, 2009Classification Code:		A -- Research and DevelopmentThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is soliciting informationthrough this Request for Information (RFI) to improve its understanding of using thecapabilities of its Constellation System, adaptations of the Constellation Systemarchitectures, and/or robotic technologies to service a wide range of notional scienceobservatory-class spacecraft. The NASA-defined notional missions studied will beconsistent with NASAs current portfolio of future space science missions and/orconceptual mission ideas that were presented to the National Research Councils (NRCs)Committee on Science Opportunities Enabled by NASAs Constellation System during thespring of 2008. These notional missions include observatories designed to operate inLow-Earth Orbit (LEO), at Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO), and at Earth-Sun Lagrangianpoints L1 and L2.NASA is broadly seeking information concerning technologies, architectures, and servicingconcepts (i.e., what elements of the mission are worth considering for serviceability,how, and why?) relevant to on-orbit servicing of observatory-class spacecraft.In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), the information requested is for planning purposes onlyand not intended to bind the Government. Background:NASA has been directed in the FY 2009 omnibus appropriations bill (P.L. 111-8) to assessthe feasibility, practicality, and cost of using the Constellation System architecture toservice observatory-class scientific spacecraft. NASA will fully utilize the unique coreexpertise and competencies for in-space servicing (human and robotic) developed by theNASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), the private sector, other government agencies,and academic partners to meet the objectives of the study. NASA will execute a robust 16-month study, managed by the Science Mission Directorate(SMD) with GSFC leading the analysis. The planning activity began in May 2009 and a finalreport to Congress is due in September 2010.NASA will assess the full business case associated with observatory serviceability. Thiswill include the assessment of science and spacecraft capabilities enabled by servicing,and what modifications would be necessary for the Constellation System architecture toprovide human and/or robotic servicing capability, including the costs associated withproviding, maintaining, and operating such servicing capabilities. Launch vehicle andsupporting services, scientific spacecraft/payload, and technology related costs willalso be assessed as part of the full business case analysis.The feasibility of using the Constellation System architecture to serviceobservatory-class spacecraft will be assessed by considering a wide range of notionalmissions. The notional missions studied will be consistent with NASAs current portfolioof future missions and/or conceptual mission ideas that were presented to the NRCsCommittee on Science Opportunities Enabled by NASAs Constellation System during thespring of 2008. These notional missions include observatories designed to operate inLow-Earth Orbit (LEO), at Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO), and at Earth-Sun Lagrangianpoints L1 and L2. Description of Anticipated Requirement:In order to complete this study, NASA must address the challenges posed by robotic andhuman servicing of observatory-class space science missions using the ConstellationSystem architecture as a starting point. Through this RFI, NASA seeks to raise itsawareness of the technologies required, their current state of maturity, possiblearchitectures, science enhancements that may result from servicing, and the programmaticrequirements associated with the implementation.In conjunction with this RFI, and to further support the study, NASA will conduct aseries of three workshops that are designed to examine and assess servicing concepts. Workshop I  Pre-RFI workshop. Around June 27, 2009. NASA will describe the notionalmissions and answer questions regarding the organization, scope, and period ofperformance of the study. This Workshop will provide information that is not available atthe time of the release of this RFI to potential responders.Responses to this RFI are due between Workshop I and Workshop II.Workshop II  Post-RFI Workshop. October 2009. RFI responders will have an opportunity topresent ideas, concepts, architectures and/or technologies that could be used to servicethe defined notional missions. The NASA evaluation team will use the following criteriafor considering RFI responses and identifying responders who will be invited to presentat Workshop II.1.	What life-extension or performance enhancements are enabled by servicing that, ifnot for servicing, would require a replacement spacecraft or mission?2.	Is it cost-effective to service the observatory-class spacecraft to either extendits operational life or to significantly increase its scientific capabilities?(a) Does use of the Constellation Systems elements make a previously impossible missiontechnically feasible?(b) Does use of the Constellation Systems elements reduce mission risk?(c) Does use of the Constellation System capabilities offer a significant cost reductionin the cost of accomplishing the mission? 3.	Are there other architectures or modifications/enhancements to the ConstellationSystem that would enable servicing?4.	Is robotic servicing an option, and what are the benefits and risks for thespecific servicing concept?At the conclusion of this Workshop II, NASA will invite respondents (drawn from theprivate sector, other government agencies, and academic partners) to participate inteams. These teams will have approximately three months to study, in detail, theservicing concepts associated with specific mission, technology, or architecture topics.Each team will deliver and present a final report at the end of the study period.Additional information on the plans for study teams will be provided at Workshop I.Workshop III  Post-Study Workshop. March 2010. Final presentation of study team reportsto the NASA evaluation team. Workshop schedules and logistical information will be posted onhttp://ServicingStudy.gsfc.nasa.gov/   .

This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 15.201.  The U.S. Department of Interior (DOI), National Park Service (NPS) is seeking a conceptual design for the Tuskegee Airman Museum located in Tuskegee, AL.  
RFI for Design Concept Plan for Sculptural Assemblage for TUAI
Synopsis:  This is a Request for Information (RFI).  The National Park Service is requesting information concerning a design for a large scale sculptural assemblage depicting the activity on the airfield and surrounding the hangars at Moton Field during World War II.  Moton Field, in Tuskegee, Alabama, was the site of primary flight training for the Tuskegee Airmen.  
Background:  On the eve of World War II, African Americans were prohibited from admission into the Army Air Corps, despite years of agitation by black leaders for greater opportunities for blacks in aviation. In 1939, in response to the political situation in Europe, Congress passed the Civilian Pilot Training Act which established a program to promote aviation training among young American civilians. This act authorized "the Air Corps to contract with civilian flying schools for the primary phase of its flight training curriculum," including schools designated for African-American pilots. The Civil Aeronautics Association (CAA) chose six black colleges to run Civilian Pilot Training (CPT) Programs.  G. L. Washington, Director of the Department of Mechanical Industries at Tuskegee Institute, one of the six schools, established the CPT program by late 1939. In February 1941, the Army Air Corps awarded Tuskegee Institute the contract to provide primary flight training.  Graduates of this course would then progress to basic flight training to be held at Tuskegee Army Air Field (TAAF), a new air base dedicated to the training of black aviators. TAAF received its first class of cadets in November 1941, a date which "marked the entry of African Americans into United States military aviation as pilots." Moton Field, at Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site, was the location of the primary flight training program for the Tuskegee Airmen, the African-American Army Air Corps pilots who distinguished themselves in World War II.
The enabling legislation includes the following goals to be accomplished at Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site:
1.	To inspire present and future generations to strive for excellence by understanding and appreciating the heroic legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen, through interpretation and education, and the preservation of cultural resources at Moton Field, which was the site of primary flight training.2.	To commemorate and interpret: a.	The impact of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II;b.	The training process for the Tuskegee Airmen, including the roles played by Moton Field, other training facilities, and related 	sites;c.	The African American struggle for greater participation in the United States Armed Forces and more significant roles in defending their country;d.	The significance of successes of the Tuskegee Airmen in leading to desegregation of the United States Armed Forces shortly after World War II; ande.	The impacts of Tuskegee Airmen accomplishments on subsequent civil rights advances of the 1950s and 1960s.3.	To recognize the strategic role of Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee     University) in training the airmen and commemorating them at this historic site.
The National Park Service's development plans for Moton Field include rehabilitation of Hangar One, the control tower, the warehouse/vehicle storage building, the locker building, and the Skyway Club; the stabilization of three sheds, ghosting in the framework of four missing historic buildings, and reconstructing Hangar Two.  The work completed so far includes the rehabilitation of Hangar One which contains exhibits and audio-visual programs focusing on airmen training and equipment, and period furnishings including a Stearman PT-17 and a Piper Cub J-3.  Hangar Two has been reconstructed and will house a visitor center/museum with exhibits and a film on the experiences of the Tuskegee Airmen after completing their training at Moton Field.  The treatment of the exterior of the site is the subject of this RFI.  The intent of the exterior environment is to convey to visitors the sense of "stepping back in time." 
The success of the aviation program at Tuskegee depended ultimately on the day-to-day interactions of many people working together towards a common goal.  Military and civilian, African American and white, men and women, all learned to work together, trust each other, depend on each other, defend each other, and appreciate each other's sincere efforts to craft new working relationships, united in defense of the country they loved.  On the tarmac at Moton Field these relationships will be depicted and interpreted.



Objective:  The purpose of this RFI is to solicit imaginative and engaging concept plans for a sculptural assemblage to be designed for Moton Field.  Please refer to the attached plan of the airfield for the proposed area to be included in the plan. What we are looking for:  Successful concept plans will convey a sense of action and drama, and a feeling that important work is being done here.  Concept plans should convey a sense of the cooperation that prevailed at the site-between military and civilian, men and women, black and white.  The concept plans should show interactions between people and should convey the excitement and drama of life at the airfield.  In addition to people, the assemblage should include the vehicles and airplanes that the staff and students used and maintained.  The assemblage should convey a sense of the importance of the work accomplished there, both in terms of training pilots to win the war and in terms of breaking the color barrier in the military.  The interiors of the hangars are very literal and concrete in their representations of life at the airfield.  In contrast, the concept plan for the exterior areas should be more creative and evocative.


The concept plan should enable the visitor to visualize the scene at Moton Airfield at the height of training during WWII.  People, planes, and vehicles should interact and give a sense of activity, cooperation, excitement, and drama.  The concept plans should convey a sense of the importance of all the jobs done here-by the mechanics and the office staff as well as the pilots and the instructors.  Some of the activities that could be interpreted through these sculptures include the following:
"	Planes taking off and landing every few seconds;"	Dozens of planes on the field (both PT-17s and PT-19s);"	Pilots inspecting their airplanes prior to flying; "	Instructors observing their students inspecting their planes and while taking their first solo flights; "	Instructors and students preparing to take off;"	Mechanics working on the planes:  changing oil, gassing them up, changing the tires, doing inspections; "	Fuel trucks filling underground storage tanks;"	The ambulance and crash truck heading out to pick up a pilot that crashed in a nearby field; "	Civilian airfield staff arriving and departing in their cars; "	Students arriving and leaving in their bus; "	Staff and students going to and coming from the Skyway Club (a recreation building); "	Secretarial staff flirting with students; "	Military and civilians working together; "	Staff and students going to and from the lunchroom; "	Military vehicles gassing up at the gas pump; "	Tuskegee students working on buildings.
The concept plan may include representations of specific people who worked at the airfield:
"	G.L. Washington (General Manager, Moton Field); "	President Frederick Douglas Patterson (President of Tuskegee Institute);"	Charles Alfred "Chief" Anderson (head of training);"	Maj. H.C. Magoon (ranking military officer at Tuskegee);"	Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. (one of the first black officers to graduate from Tuskegee);"	William Childs (Chief mechanic);"	Carrie Campbell (gate guard); "	Katie Williams (secretary);"	Mildred Hanson (parachute rigger);"	Mrs. Johnson (lunchroom operator);"	Female mechanic.
The finished sculptures should require low or no maintenance, be durable, and be resistant to vandalism.  The proposed design should be realistic and reasonable to produce. 
Who can participate:  Individual artists or groups of artists or design firms, educational Art Departments. 
What submissions should include:  No more than ten typewritten pages describing the concept plan with accompanying concept drawings, limited to 20. Please include contact information (name, organization, address, telephone number, and e-mail address) and a summary of your credentials, along with any pertinent business classifications (i.e. 8(a), SDVOSB, HBCU, etc.).
Review considerations:
Does the concept plan 
"	give the visitor the sense of "stepping back in time"?"	convey a sense of action and drama?"	convey a sense of the importance of the work being done there?"	interpret the various activities that occurred at the site?"	interpret the relationships between the people who worked there?"	interpret the cooperation between different groups of people who worked there (African American and white, military and civilian, men and women)?"	interpret the significant role women played at the site?"	convey the sense that Moton Field was a place of opportunity and challenge?"	convey a sense of the confidence and camaraderie that developed within and between the people who worked and trained there?"	convey the sense that at Moton Field African Americans were determined to use their skills and talents to prove that African Americans could fly, fight, lead, and work together as a cohesive unit?

<DESC>PURPOSE:  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR MARKET RESEARCH ONLY.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking qualified concerns with specific and recent experience with Common Operational Picture (COP) Technology Refresh and creation of Decision Support Systems (DSS) that automate the capture, assessment and utility of multi-source data.  DHS is seeking the following:  (a) To determine if  the capabilities and supporting requirements described in this RFI are practical and complete; (2) To identify specific capabilities and supporting requirements that can only be addressed through customization of proven products or development of new technology; (3)  To identify the degree of risk associated with customization of proven products or development of new technology; (4) To Identify the methodologies and tools that can result in integrated solutions; (5) To Identify new data sources, analysis tools, and opportunities for collaboration that could enhance situational awareness and enable timely, risk mitigated, decision making across the entire Homeland Security Community. (6) To identify other information that would be useful to the mission owner or program manager. 

BACKGROUND:  The Homeland Security Presidential Directive – Five (HSPD-5) (February 2003) designated the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (SECDHS) as the “Principal Federal Official for Domestic Incident Management.” This role was expanded by Section 515 of the Post Katrina Emergency Reform Act (PKEMRA) (October 2006) which directed the National Operation Center (NOC), as the principal operations center for the Department, to: (a) Provide situational awareness and a COP for the entire Federal Government, and for State, local, and tribal Governments as appropriate, in the event of a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster. (b) Ensure that critical terrorism and disaster-related information reaches Government decision-makers. Furthermore, the National Response Framework (December 2008), stated that the NOC: (a) Maintains the COP that provides overall situational awareness for incident information. (b) Is required to meet its information-fusion and information-sharing responsibilities by providing spot reports, situation reports, and other information–sharing tools, all supported by and distributed through its NOC COP. (c) Has a high priority to continue development and rapid integration of electronic reporting and information-sharing tools (at all levels) in support of the COP. 

CONSTRANTS: (1) The NOC COP and the NOC DSS are presented to the user through a single user interface (UI).  (a) The system will be available to users with low-tech equipment and limited bandwidth, such as mobile devices, slow internet connections and old computing platforms. (b) HSIN user authentication procedures and technology will be used to grant attribute-based access.  Therefore, different degrees of information will be available to different users. (2) The NOC COP and the NOC DSS will fully support Web 2.0 technologies.  (a) The system will use DHS enterprise services such as the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN), HSIN Help Desk, the Integrated Common Analytical Viewer (iCAV) and DHS Earth.  There will be no duplication of capability. (b) The system will allow real-time changes to the UI without disruption in availability. (c) The system capabilities will be independent of the data feeds or analytical tools that certain users may employ. (3) The NOC requires a COP and DSS at the Unclassified, Secret and Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) levels. Although the host platform will be different, the UI will be nearly identical for each classification level. (4) The NOC COP visualization system will allow users to create a unique User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) on a single desktop or for dissemination on multiple panels as found in a typical operations center. An individual UDOP does not affect or copy back to the NOC COP. 

DESIRED SYSTEM CAPABILITIES: (1) AUTOMATE INFORMATION INGEST AND TRIAGE: (a) Tag, flag and extract information from asynchronous (unstructured) sources such as email. (b) Receive and filter information from pre-set discovery agents. (c) Automatically elevate information to the shared DHS NOC workspace on HSIN. (d) Automatically push information to the NOC COP. (2) ASSESS DATA AND INFORMATION: (a) Integrate advanced analytical tools such as automated searches, modeling, text analytics, geospatial rendering, report generation, and data management services currently available in DHS and other products configured to meet NOC requirements. (b) Link to the DHS NOC workspace on HSIN where collaboration can occur.  (3) SEARCH FOR INFORMATION: (a) Enable a federated single query search using applications currently available in DHS and other products configured to meet NOC requirements. (b) Automatically search internal and external databases, documents and e-mail. (c) Run simple or complex queries of multiple databases by specifying attributes such as keywords, phrases, time periods, or locations. (d) Elevate information to the shared DHS NOC workspace on HSIN. (4) FACILITATE COLLABORATION: (a) Use the DHS NOC workspace on HSIN to conduct collaborative work sessions with multiple participants. (b) View and access data elevated to the DHS NOC workspace on HSIN. (c) Allow users with appropriate privileges to view elevated information, attach commentary and observations, and insert new information. (5) ENABLE ACCESS TO HISTORICAL DATA:  (a) Store and retrieve all structured and unstructured information received by or created by the NOC.  Allow access to previous versions of documents. (b) Capture and store the actual NOC COP display and any collaborative work sessions for later review and analysis. (c) Perform extract-transform-load actions from old to new systems or formats. (6) VISUALIZE INFORMATION: (a) Allow for the automatic display of data and reports in the NOC COP in accordance with established business rules. (b) Allow users to create a unique UDOP on a single desktop or for dissemination on multiple panels as found in a typical operations center. An individual UDOP does not affect or copy back to the NOC COP.  (7) DISPLAY GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION: (a) Use DHS enterprise geospatial services including iCAV and DHS Earth.  There will be no duplication of capability. (b) Automatically or manually organize and depict layered information geospatially on map or other image.  (8) FACILITATE INTEROPERABILITY: (a) Allow the NOC to disseminate and distribute the NOC COP to the entire Homeland Security Community. (b) Encrypt data according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-53 guidelines. (c) Comply with all information assurance standards and security classification requirements. (d) Provide controls for authorized users to access information sources across all security classification levels/domains from Unclassified through TS/SCI.  Provide similar controls for user access to special types of information such as Proprietary Information, Personal Identification Information (PII), Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) Information, and US Persons Information.  (9) PROVIDE SECURITY:  (a) Grant attribute-based access so that different degrees of information will be available to different users. (b) Deploy a one-way-transfer mechanism to automate the movement of relevant information from unclassified to classified systems without having to manually transfer the material.  

MISSION SCENARIOS / USE CASES: (1) The NOC COP and DSS must enhance SA and facilitate timely, risk mitigated, decision making across the entire Homeland Security Community during every type of Homeland Security incident as represented by the Mission Scenarios/ Use Cases below. (2) Please consider the following mission scenarios / use cases when responding this RFI.    (a) SCENARIO #0 STEADY STATE:  All known incidents are below the level of national significance.

<DESC>MISSION NEED STATEMENT FOR (Establishing Auxiliary Power Unit Overhaul) 1. Defense Planning Guidance Element. This Mission Need Statement outlines the need for the establishment of an overhaul facility at Corpus Christi Army Depot (CCAD) for the T-62T-2B Auxiliary Power Unit (APU).  The overwhelming requirement for the T2B APU requires an additional source for mai ntenance be established to support that need.    2. Mission and Threat Analyses. a. Mission.  This overhaul capability will provide an Army capable source to implement Best Business Practices resulting in reduced APU and component repair turn around time, smaller required inventory levels because of streamlined material integration pro cesses, improved readiness, increased depot capacity and reduced total ownership cost through a streamlined logistics infrastructure. b. Threat.  This requirement will affect Army missions worldwide.  However, the scope of work requires the entire workload for this requirement to be conducted at the establishing facility in Corpus Christi, TX. 3. Non-materiel Alternatives. Non-material alternatives for this requirement would be inadequate.  In order to provide a serviceable and workable product, a material integration strategy would have to be a part of the requirement. 4. Potential Materiel Alternatives. The Army currently has a Depot Maintenance Interservice Agreement (DMISA) being utilized to overhaul this APU at Cherry Point Naval Air Station.  Cherry Point is not able to support the Armys need to better control configuration management on this item. In an effort to improve configuration management, the need to establish overhaul capabilities at an Army facility has become a necessary.  Inter-service cooperation will continue.     5.  Constraints. a. Manpower and Personnel.  Estimated manpower requirements include 2 Man Years for engineering support and 1 Man Year of Program Management support.  There is an additional requirement of 1 Man year for a parts warehouse manager to handle supply chain and  parts kitting operations. b. Training.  N/A c. Human Factors Engineering, Safety and Health Hazards.   CCAD, an ISO 9001 Certified facility, is one of the largest helicopter overhaul and repair facilities in the world.  In addition to Army aircraft, they overhaul/repair helicopters and components for the Air Force, Navy and Marines.  As the Cornerstone of A viation Readiness, their multi-skilled and dedicated workforce, backed by state of the art facilities and equipment, support a wide range of weapon and component systems.  CCADs capabilities are backed by extensive test facilities.  Equipment and maintena nce hangars are required to support multi-weapon systems such as AH-64, H-60 and CH-47 aircraft platforms and related components.  CCAD maintains a wide range of component test facilities (test cells) necessary to overhaul/repair mechanical, electrical, hy draulic components, instruments, rotor blades, rotor heads, transmissions, gearboxes, and turbo shaft engines.  CCADs capabilities at a glance include Test & Inspection, Metal Processing, and Fabrication & Repair performed by CCAD artisans to support Mult i-Service Weapon System Readiness. d. Soldier Survivability.  N/A   e. Logistics Support.

<DESC>The Coast Guard is seeking qualified sources that can remove old reefer equipment on CG 210’, 270’ and 378’ cutters and replace with government furnished Seahorse refrigeration system - Carrier Model Numbers 90YR16NSD3ND6K9Z; 90YR28NSF3ND6M9Z and 90YR20NSD3ND6K9Z; Keep Rite unit coolers KLP-103VE-S4* and KLP-104VE-S4*; along with the following government furnished components:  electrical thermostat, electrical cable and breaker, lighting fixtures; alarms; MSA ChillGard L-series leak detection system with visual and audible alarm beacons.   Most of the work to be performed pertains to ship repair, metal fabrication and welding.  Installation of the new reefer equipment is approximately 25% of the overall job. The Coast Guard anticipates awarding a requirements type contract with one (1) base year and two (2) option years.  Removal and installation shall be accomplished in accordance with Coast Guard specifications, commercial specifications and marine industry standards.The solicitation will be issued as full and open competition for the removal and installation of all equipment except the Carrier Transicold refrigeration system, which shall be installed by an authorized Carrier Representative. The limitation to use only Carrier Transicold Authorized Representatives will allow the government to maintain the OEM warranty.    Accordingly, it is believe that this requirement precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center from obtaining competition (for the install of Carrier Transicold refrigeration system only) as they are available from this source.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to perform this install for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.    Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the items are invited to submit complete information discussion such capabilities as follows:  (i.e. salient physical functional and serviceability characteristics) (1)  show that they satisfactorily installed a Carrier Transicold refrigeration for the Government or the prime equipment manufacturer and (2) that the Carrier warranty can be maintained if install by other than an authorized representative .   It is the Government’s belief that only Carrier, the manufacturer and/or its authorized dealers and distributors can perform the required install in order to protect the warranty of the Carrier Seahorse equipment.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing capabilities in duplicate within fifteen (15) days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing information is required.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for this information solicited.  Responses must be concise and be specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above.  Concerns that respond to the notice must fully demonstrate their capabilities to meet the requirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capabilities should be sent to the attention of  Sharon Jackson, Contract Specialist (CODE 045/54).  See number notes 22*****

<CONTACT>Marjorie A. Dulatt, Contracting Officer, Phone (859) 219-4057, Email majorie.dulatt@lex.doe.gov
<DESC><p>The United States Department of Energy (DOE) intends to extend the current remediation services contract with Paducah Remediation Services, LLC at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) to continue remediation and disposition of specific areas on the site (land sites and groundwater) by removing legacy waste, performing facility decontamination and decommissioning (D&amp;D), and operating the site waste storage facilities in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, DOE Directives, permits, agreements and Orders. Additionally, PRS will be tasked with added work under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The proposed contract extension is for nine months from October 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010.
<p>Environmental remediation services at the PGDP as listed below are contemplated as part of the contract extension. These services include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Groundwater Environmental Actions<br />&bull; Material Disposition<br />&bull; Waste Disposition and Waste Facility Operations<br />&bull; Facilities Disposition<br />&bull; Site wide Remedial Action<br />&bull; Waste Disposal Options Project Planning<br />&bull; Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Activities<br />&bull; Environmental Monitoring and Reporting<br />&bull; Project Support<br />&bull; Work to be covered by the ARRA: acceleration of D&amp;D of the C-410 Feed Complex, C-340 Complex, and C-746-A East End Smelter.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is the Competition in Contracting Act (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The present contact with PRS is due to expire on September 30, 2009. The proposed contract extension will allow environmental remediation activities which reduce potential health risks to the public to continue at the Paducah site until completion of the on-going follow-on procurement. The contract extension (which includes ARRA funded scope) supports ARRA objectives by creating additional jobs and reducing life cycle costs associated with environmental remediation effort at the PGDP.</p>
<p>PRS as the incumbent site environmental remediation contractor is the only contractor who has unique qualifications to continue the necessary environmental remediation activities at the Paducah site without a break in service until award is made of the on-going competitive. DOE anticipates award will be made in the 3rd quarter of Fiscal Year 2010 as published on the DOE EM Acquisition Forecast website.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS UNDER FAR PART 12, 15, OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS UNDER FAR PART 14. IF PARTIES CHOOSE TO RESPOND, ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AR THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPONDENT AND WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>Interested parties believing they have all of the capabilities may submit capability statements to provide all of the services, including a demonstration of the ability to meet all of the needs identified above within the required timeframes. The capabilities statement describing and demonstrating the above shall be submitted within 15 days of publication of this notice to the following address: U.S. Department of Energy, Portsmouth/Paducah Project Office, 1017 Majestic Drive, Suite 200, Lexington, KY 40513, ATTENTION: Marjorie A. Dulatt</p>

These services include, but are not limited to the following: <br />&bull; Demolition, characterization, and remediation of the contaminated soils at X-533, X-633, and X-760 inactive facilities <br />&bull; Post remediation surveillance and maintenance of groundwater treatment facilities<br />&bull; Environmental monitoring and reporting of on-site and off-site air, soils and water <br />&bull; National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance, cultural resource surveys <br />&bull; Disposition of highly enriched uranium <br />&bull; Depleted uranium hexafluoride (DUF6) cylinder management Maintenance and disposition of existing uranium materials <br />&bull; Repackaging and disposition of uranium materials <br />&bull; Treatment and disposition of LEU cylinders <br />&bull; Cleanup and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) activities <br />&bull; Project Support</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is the Competition in Contracting Act (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The present contact with LPP is due to expire on September 30, 2009. The proposed contract extension will allow environmental remediation activities to continue at the Portsmouth site until completion of the on-going D&amp;D procurement and transition to a new contractor. The contract extension (which includes ARRA funded scope) supports ARRA objectives by creating additional jobs and reducing life cycle costs associated with environmental remediation efforts at Portsmouth.</p>
<p>LPP as the incumbent site environmental remediation contractor is the only contractor who has unique qualifications to continue the necessary environmental remediation activities at the Portsmouth site without a break in service until award is made of the on-going competitive. DOE anticipates award will be made in the 2rd quarter of Fiscal Year 2010 as published on the DOE EM Acquisition Forecast website.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS UNDER FAR PART 12, 15, OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS UNDER FAR PART 14. IF PARTIES CHOOSE TO RESPOND, ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AR THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPONDENT AND WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THE GOVENRMENT. Interested parties believing they have all of the capabilities may submit capability statements to provide all of the services, including a demonstration of the ability to meet all of the needs identified above within the required timeframes. The capabilities statement describing and demonstrating the above shall be submitted within 15 days of publication of this notice to the following address: U.S. Department of Energy, Portsmouth/Paducah Project Office, 1017 Majestic Drive, Suite 200, Lexington, KY 40513, ATTENTION: Robert J. Bell</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Lion Precision of Shoreview, Minnesota for the purchase of a R-Test Measurement System under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106-(b): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  
The Sole Source determination is based on the need for the R-Test Measurement System to operate in accordance with the original equipment specifications from the manufacturer. 

The Machine Tool Metrology (MTM) Group of the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL) is involved in the research and development of advanced measurement techniques and equipment for measuring performance characteristics of machine tools. Geometric accuracy and positioning capability of machine tools are key indicators of machine tool performance.

The R-Test Measurement System by Lion Precision is the only commercially available hardware/software to carry out measurement of the relative position and orientation of rotational and translational machine components to enable analysis of 5-axis contouring performance of a machine tool.  There are other sensors that may be used to construct measurement system for such purpose, but complicated analysis software needs to be developed in house to accommodate such simpler sensors. Using the commercially available system with its own hardware and software would save the Government significant time and effort eliminating the need to develop new hardware and analysis software.

 Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334513, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. (EST) on June 26, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to janet.lamb@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Emergency Services Division, intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order with Everbridge, Inc., for additional licenses for its web-based Mass Notification Software System.  

This is an “interoperatable communication” alert notification system which provides instantaneous alerts about emergency situations that exists on the NIST campus.  It is in alignment with the NIST Safety program since it protects the “life safety” of all of the NIST employees and will be used when there are hazardous situations, chemical spills, weather alerts, terrorist threats and other emergency situations.

NIST is currently utilizing the vendor hosted, web-based, software as a service (SaaS), 3n (now Everbridge) mass notification system within the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) Operating Unit.  The software was purchased one year ago and provides tools for alert and notification to all individuals within the NCNR during emergency situations.  

The Emergency Services Division within the NIST Office of Chief Facilities Management Officer requires additional licenses to incorporate all individuals within NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland and NIST Boulder, Colorado facilities.  The additional licenses will enable NIST to standardize under one system.

The 3n emergency notification system has undergone extensive security testing and evaluation (ST&E) by the General Services Administration to meet C& A requirements identified. All Federal Government IT, IT services, and IT services being operated on behalf of the Federal Government MUST be tested and authorized per the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), which states: 

The head of each agency shall provide “information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of :
         •          information systems used or operated by an agency or; 
         •          by a contractor of an agency or
         •          other organization on behalf of an agency.” 

Additionally, NIST must maintain 100% Certification and Accreditation (C&A) percentage (that is all systems/applications assessed and authorized) for NIST to maintain Green status on the President’s Management Report Card.

3N was C&A’d by GSA and we have leveraged their accreditation to complete roughly 80% of C&A activities required for full accreditation here at NIST.  If NIST were to procure another type of software licenses,, the C&A activities may be required to start over and without another accreditation to leverage (as in GSA’s case), C&A activities for this moderate-impact service could expect to take ~6 months at potentially additional cost of $30K or more while potentially jeopardizing safety operations at NIST.

In addition, the duplication of cost that the Government would encounter by soliciting a new software product would not be recovered through competition.

Based on recent market research, NIST is unaware of any other sources besides Everbridge, Inc. that can provide the required additional 3N web-based Mass Notification Software System licenses; however, sources that can satisfy NIST’s requirements for additional 3N licenses may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  

This notice is not a solicitation, and no solicitation is currently available. Inquires will only be accepted via email to sandra.shaffner@nist.gov.  All information received by 4:00 p.m., EST, 6/26/2009 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed acquisition will be based on responses to this notice; such determination is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Mammal Laboratory located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with Aerial Imaging Solutions (AIS). The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed vendor will provide technical support and consulting services on-site surveys to be conducted by NOAA Aircraft Operations Center, Tampa Florida and Monterey, CA in which custom equipment designed and built by Aerial Imaging Solutions will be used. The equipment consists of a rocking mount for 3 digital cameras (Canon 1Ds Mark III) to be used in the belly port of a NOAA Twin Otter, and is the only mount of this type in existence. The mount was built by AIS for NOAA (AFSC-NMML and SWFSC); a single camera mount built by AIS was first used by NMML in 2007 and this equipment will serve as a backup to the 3-camera mount during the 2009-11 surveys. The mount and cameras are controlled by a government-supplied computer running software written by Aerial Imaging Solutions. Flight and camera parameters entered by the computer's operator are used to determine the required forward motion compensation (FMC) and camera firing interval. The system also takes input from a GPS and radar altimeter to record location and altitude for each photograph. Surveys will be conducted in June/July 2009, 2010 and 2011 in Alaska. The trips to Seattle in June each year are to help with the installation of the mount into the Twin Otter aircraft prior its departure for AK to start the survey. This is necessary to test the system in the survey aircraft to insure compatibility each year, since modifications and improvements to both the mount and aircraft are made continually. The trip to Anchorage in June/July 2009 is an example of the expenses necessary to provide on-site repairs, if needed, while the trips to Monterey are examples of pre-season testing to insure continuous compatibility. The government intends to negotiate a firm- fixed price contract with period of performance of twelve months from date of award plus one option year. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.

<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service, Ted Stevens Marine Research Institute located in Juneau, AK on a sole source basis with Delta Oceanographics. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed vendor will provide a submersible to complete offshore Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) research in the Gulf of Alaska in August of 2009. This research will examine sponge recruitment and recovery from commercial trawl gear near Salisbury Sound. In 1996 a NOAA research team initiated this study when they used the Delta submersible to observe the immediate effects of a single trawl pass on seafloor epifauna. In 1997, the Delta was used again to observe the seafloor one year post-trawling. Damage and recovery of sponges was determined by comparing the density and incidence of injuries among sponges on trawled and untrawled transects. In 2009, NOAA scientists are revisiting the study site to examine recruitment and recovery of sponges 13 years post-trawling. In order to compare study results between years, it is absolutely necessary to replicate the study methods used previously. Therefore, a requirement of the study is to reuse the Delta submersible and its suite of cameras and laser-scaling devices. A manned submersible is essential to the study because a scientist must be present in situ on the seafloor to make real-time audio observations of seafloor biota and trawl disturbances while the submersible completes video transects. Observations made in situ are priceless in the laboratory while interpreting the data recorded on video transects. The conning tower on the Delta allows for 360&ordm; of visibility which allows the pilot to search the seafloor for transect markers and selected biota. This feature of the submersible is unequaled by any ROV and not known to exist among other submersibles. Without this ability, the probability of relocating transect markers is severely diminished and therefore the objectives of the study are jeopardized. The government intends to negotiate a firm- fixed price contract which will include 2 days of mobilization, one day of demobilization, seven days at-sea days and transportation and logistics. The period of performance will be 5 Aug through 14 August 2009. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.

<DESC><p>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition
<p>Solicitation No. AB133F-09-RP-0108, Professional/Scientific/Technical Services for the Research, Culture, and Recovery of White Abalone</p>
<p>In accordance with the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (41 U.S.C. 253) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.303, the following information is being provided to support justification for other than full and open competition:</p>
<p>1. AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Commerce<br />NOAA, Western Acquisition Division, (WAD)</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED</p>
<p>The WAD proposes to negotiate a sole-source contract with Bodega Bay Laboratory, U.C. at Davis, in order for it to provide research, culture, and recovery of the white abalone for the Protected Resources Division at Long Beach, California. The estimated amount of the contract is $320,000.00.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, Protected Resources Division (NMFS, PRD) requires the implementation of the recovery of white abalone, a species listed by the NMFS, as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 2001. Contract awards must go to an ESA permitted entity that can maintain white abalone brood stock and captive raised animals in a healthy and safe environment. Crucial elements for recovering endangered white abalone are: (1) developing the best methods for achieving reproduction in a captive setting; (2) ensuring the animals remain disease free in the laboratory and in nature once out-planted; (3) examining the growth and survival of young life stages in a laboratory and natural setting; (4) and initiating restoration of natural populations.</p>
<p>White abalone was listed as the first federally endangered marine invertebrate under the ESA in 2001. As required by the ESA, a recovery plan, which outlines the actions that must be taken in order to recover the species, was developed and finalized in the fall of 2008. One of the required actions is to establish methods for captively propagating white abalone so that laboratory generated animals may be used to enhance and restore natural populations until they have met particular criteria (e.g., achieving certain densities, size ranges, etc.). In accordance with section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, this recovery action must be carried out at an ESA permitted facility where staff with expertise in marine invertebrate reproductive biology, pathology and ecology exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by paragraph 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), full and open competition is not required when only one responsible source and no other will satisfy the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>5. PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>The proposed project is crucial for implementing the NMFS recovery plan for the federally endangered white abalone. White abalone will be maintained at the Bodega Bay Laboratory, U.C. Davis, in a healthy and safe environment. The optimal methods for achieving reproduction in a captive setting, ensuring that these animals remain disease free, examining the growth and survival of young life stages in a laboratory setting, and initiating a plan for future out-planting will be achieved during the course of the contract.</p>
<p>Due to the uniqueness of this project, the requestor has attested that to her knowledge, there are only a few qualified persons to conduct this kind of work.</p>
<p>&bull; Dr. Gary N. Cherr, PI: Professor, Departments of Environmental Toxicology and Nutrition, Bodega Bay Laboratory, U.C. Davis. Professor Cherr is the Principal Investigator and the designated Responsible Person for the ESA permit now held by U.C. Davis. Professor Cherr is an expert in reproductive and developmental biology of marine invertebrates and fish, and also investigates impacts of environmental stress on reproductive and developmental success. He has previously published cryopreservation methods for aquatic animals and will oversee that effort with white abalone. He would oversee the maintenance component of the proposed work as well as the reproductive biology research program.</p>
<p>&bull; Dr. Jim Moore, co-investigator: Associate Clinical Professor at the U.C. Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and a Senior Fish Pathologist at the California Department of Fish and <br />Game.</p>
<p>Dr. Moore is the Manager of the Shellfish Health Laboratory at the Bodega Marine Laboratory,<br />with extensive experience in abalone disease research. Dr. Moore is an expert in the fields of <br />pathology, health management, conservation, and culture of marine invertebrates. Dr. Moore <br />has been working with the white abalone recovery team and is aware of the goals of the <br />recovery plan that NMFS is currently developing.</p>
<p>&bull; Dr. Laura Rogers-Bennett, co-investigator: Research Associate in the School of Veterinary Medicine, U.C. Davis, and Senior Biologist Specialist (Marine/Fisheries), California Department of Fish and Game. Dr. Rogers-Bennett serves as the lead of the Resource Assessment Laboratory at the Bodega Marine Laboratory. Dr. Rogers-Bennett has extensive experience with abalone fisheries, and larval abalone biology using both sub-tidal research and mathematical modeling techniques.</p>
<p>6. EFFORT MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS WERE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS POSSIBLE</p>
<p>A Sources Sought Notice was posted on the FedBizOpps website, with no responses. A "Notice of Intent to Sole Source" with Bodega Bay Marine Laboratory of U.C. Davis will be posted on the FedBizOpps website. All interested concerns will be encouraged to submit a capability and performance statement by the required due date. The notice will also state that all submittals received by the due date set forth in said notice, will be considered up to thirty (30) days from the notice date.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION THAT FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICES WILL BE OBTAINED</p>
<p>NOAA will obtain Independent Government Estimate (IGE) based on the labor rates and compare the rates to other contracts for the same/similar North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Based on the above, the Government can be assumed to be able to establish reasonable pricing.</p>
<p>8. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET SURVEY CONDUCTED</p>
<p>A "Sources Sought" notice was posted on the FedBizOpps website on May 7, 2009. All interested concerns were encouraged to submit a capability and performance statement by May 22, 2009. No responses were received. Extensive research was performed using the "Dynamic Small Business Search" feature of "CCR.gov" on NAICS code 541990, and there are people and companies that offer services under said NAICS but none having experience with white abalone.</p>
<p>9. OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN<br />COMPETITION</p>
<p>In this era of shrinking federal budgets, it is essential that NMFS seek new and innovative ways to carry out its mission of protecting and enhancing living marine resources. This project will help accomplish the goals of the NMFS' White Abalone Recovery Plan by employing the services and expertise of Drs. Cherr, Moore and Rogers-Bennett. This kind of expertise does not currently exist<br />at NMFS and therefore carrying out this research at BML is essential in helping NMFS achieve its goal of conserving, protecting, and recovering marine species. Without partnerships like this, the ability of NMFS to carry out the goals of the White Abalone Recovery Plan and the ESA would be severely limited.</p>
<p>Multiple research groups can receive authorization to work with the same endangered/threatened species, but typically these different entities would not be performing the same type of research as cited herein; instead, they would be proposing to accomplish different unique tasks. There are so many research efforts available, that once a permit is issued for a specific task for a particular project, usually another entity will not want a permit for the same activity/study/research effort. Over a period of time, the efforts of professionals who have been permitted to work on the white abalone project gain more expertise and knowledge in same. The professionals mentioned above are the only persons known to have the knowledge and expertise required to fulfill the unique duties required of the project.</p>
<p>10. LIST OF SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING, INTEREST IN THIS ACQUISITION</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>11. ACTION TO OVERCOME BARRIERS TO COMPETITION IN FUTURE PROCUREMENTS</p>
<p>Future procurements for services will be advertised in FedBizOpps; however, competition for this procurement may continue to be limited due to the fact than in order to perform the requirement, the contractor must maintain an ESA permit.</p>
<p>12. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>The justification for other than full and open competition has been certified as accurate and complete by the Program Office through a signed CD-492, Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition, as well as obtaining authorization from John Oliver as required per Memorandum dated 9/4/02.</p>

<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the Bureau of Transportation Research (BTS), within the Research and Special Programs Administration (RITA), within the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT), plans to issue a SOLE-SOURCE contract or delivery order to Tele Atlas North America, Inc. (hereinafter “TANA”), to pay for an annual renewal of RITA’s lease, from TANA, of street network geospatial data and technical support for such data.  That lease covers technical support and semi-annual deliveries of the network geospatial data, which is part of the RITA / BTS Enterprise Architecture.  The estimated cost of the subject lease-renewal is $120,000.  RITA / BTS already has systems and applications based on the TANA data and continues to develop geospatial applications using the TANA data.  TANA is the sole manufacturer of its network geospatial data, and is the sole provider of technical support for such data.  DOT therefore believes that TANA is the only available source for the needed data and services.  HOWEVER, any company or organization other than TANA, which believes that it is capable of providing such data and services to RITA / BTS at the high level of quality and efficiency that is indispensable to RITA / BTS, may e-mail, to Mr. James Mowery, a Statement of Qualifications, which must be received by Mr. Mowery at james.mowery@dot.gov  not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time June 29, 2009.  HOWEVER, any company or organization that is contemplating the submission of such a Statement of Qualifications should bear in mind that the company or organization would not ultimately be able to defeat NANA in a competitive procurement for the needed network geospatial data and technical support services without later proving (in a full-blown proposal) that the company or organization is the best buy for RITA / BTS, taking into consideration not only technical factors and quality factors but also pricing factors and past performance factors.

<DESC>Under the Authority of Federal Acquisitions Regulation, Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302, The U.S. Census Bureau intends to contract with Lab Tech Systems, Silver Spring, Maryland, on a sole source basis to provide studio engineering support for broadcast studio design, maintenance and repair.  The contractor shall facilitate new equipment, installation, broadcast feed connection and transmission, upgrade to HD and eventual replacement of the AVIDS.  Please see additional information in the attached statement of work. The US Census Bureau believes Lab Tech Systems' experience, and familiarity with the configuration of the original studio, as they built it, makes them uniquely qualified to complete the required services, and as timing is critical, it would not be advantageous to the Government to acquire services of a new contractor as that would delay the studio upgrade by months, by investigating the existing system and Census Bureau needs. The period of performance for this award will be from date of award for a period of one year, with one option year. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Census Bureau's needs. Proposals must be submitted to Lisa Safewright via email lisa.r.safewright@census.gov, or fax to 301-763-4624. This notice is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available for future requirements. If no affirmative written response is received by June 22, 2009, a contract may be issued to Lab Tech Systems, without further notice.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement


The U.S. Coast Guard has a requirement to obtain engineering support for the development of a MAESTRO Finite Element (FE) model for the Fast Response Cutter (FRC)-B; for the estimation of the hydrodynamic loading to be applied to the FRC-B MAESTRO FE model by using the VERES wave loads prediction approach; and for the development of an interface required for the application of hydrodynamic loading from VERES onto the FRC-B MAESTRO FEA model. The results of this effort will be used to evaluate for cutter operational envelop definition and hull structural and life maintenance strategies. See attached Statement of Work for further details. The U.S. Coast Guard intends to issue a sole source fixed price contract to DRS C3 Systems LLC (DRS) located at 400 Professional Drive, Gaithersburg, MD 20879-3417. DRS designed, developed and installed the core MAESTRO software programs and developed additional improvements and updates to this software. It is the Government belief that DRS is the only contractor who possesses the proprietary rights to the software that needs to be modified in support of this effort. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304©(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii),  “Only One Responsible Source and No other Supplies or Services Will satisfy Agency Requirements”. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because DRS is the original designer and developer of the software. They are the only acceptable source for this requirement. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above services are invited to submit complete information discussing the same in duplicate within five (5) working days of this announcement. Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. Alternate proposal data must include sufficient information to allow the U.S. Coast Guard to evaluate. The U.S. Coast Guard does not intend to pay for information solicited. Responses must be concise and specific to the requirements. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 541330 and the small business size standard is $4.5 million. Solicitation HSCG40-09-R-40033 is established in support of this announcement. It is anticipated that award will be made by July 15, 2009.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

Schools are the number one concern of military families, and many families do not want to come to Nellis because they have heard "bad things" about the schools.

<DESC>     The 96th Contracting Squadron, Eglin AFB, Florida intends to solicit and award a firm-fixed price contract for a Computed Micro Tomography X-Ray Machine (specific description below).  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and Subpart 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  The announcement number is F1TBAP9092A001.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Please identify your business size in your response based upon this standard. This is a full and open competition.

Background:  

     We are seeking a tool to investigate the microstructures of composite materials ranging from energetic materials to concretes.  We would like to make non-destructive measurements and construct a 3-D renderings which could then be input into a computer model, as well as use these microstructures to determine characteristics of the compacted materials such as specific surface area of primary particles and particle/pore geometry characteristics.  Particle sizes of organic explosive might be as small as several microns, while the aggregate in concrete would be considerably larger, and therefore require samples greater than 65 mm in diameter.
     We are specifically interested in taking the 3-D structures provided by the XCMT machine and turning it into a computational mesh. (The 3-D image needs to be in a CAD format.)  The necessary outcome is to take the actual internal structure and generate a computational mesh in order to perform analysis on that known structure.  


The requirement consists of the following items:  
     1 Computed Micro Tomography X-Ray Machine

Description:  
Minimum Requirements are as follows:
1.	At a 5 mm sample size, 1 micron resolution is required.
2.	At a 50 mm sample size, 10 micron resolution is required.
3.	Largest sample size to be at least 65 mm diameter by 100 mm long.
4.	The system must have the ability to handle materials that have similar material contrast. For example, the system must be able to resolve table sugar dispersed in a polyurethane binder, as well as fine aluminum powder (~20 micron) dispersed in a polyurethane binder.
5.	The system must be able to examine samples that are irregularly shaped.
6.	The system must effectively handle a large variety of materials including carbon fiber composites, polymer foams, machined parts, metal specimens and high explosives with large range of Z materials.
7.	The system must be able to convert the data to 3-D computer generated images.
8.	 Clarification/Revision on size restrictions: The system shall be installed through a 7.0 foot high, 5 foot 3 inch wide door. The system must be shipped in such a way as to be deliverable through this door using standard dunnage (forklift, straps, carts, etc.). The dimensions of the door will allow for a maximum height with dunnage of 6 feet 8 inches. The system must be deliverable without causing scraping damage to the flooring.
9.	 Software for quantitative analysis and for presentation.
10.	Must produce negligible X-Ray signature outside of instrument so that no dosimeter is required for personnel when working with or around the XCMT continuously (2,000 hours per year).
11.	 All parts/components of this system must be new. No recycled, refurbished, or otherwise used parts are permitted in this system.
12.	 Utility Requirements:  The vendor will provide all electronic controllers as well as interconnection and power cables required for operation using 110 VAC, 60 Hz power. The system can be air cooled or water cooled.  If water is required for instrument cooling, the chilling unit must be provided with the instrument and operate using 100V, 60Hz power. Vendor will describe in writing the utility requirements (including connections and capacity) upon contract approval so that appropriate infrastructure arrangements can be made prior to shipment of XCMT.
13.	The vendor will provide a copy of all documentation and user instructions prior to shipment.
14.	The vendor will include in the proposal the approximate delivery and installation dates of the system.  ***Delivery shall be no later than 20 weeks ADC!!***  Include the cost of shipping in proposals.

16.	The vendor will clearly describe which parts are covered under the standard warranty and the duration of the standard warranty. 
17.	No minimum specifications have been specified regarding the x-ray energy, detector type, and speed of reconstruction.  X-ray energy and detector shall be evaluated based on their effect on the sample size, resolution, and ability to contrast multiple-low Z materials mixed with high Z metals. The contractor can use whatever energy s/he deems necessary to meet the requirements.  The speed of reconstruction must not exceed 16 hours.  

     All interested vendors will be given an opportunity to set up a scheduled time to present their technical capabilities to the government.

<DESC><p>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Directorate of Contracting, Edwards Air Force Base, California intends to award a commercial purchase order to Telemetry and Communication Systems. A sources sought was posted on Federal Business Opportunities on 12 Aug 2008 and 12 Sep 2008. Market research was performed via the Internet and contact with other potential vendors. Telemetry and Communication Systems (TCS). This acquisition is for:
<p>The USAF Test Pilot School (TPS) requires the refurbishment of an 8 ft antenna system with a new ACU, Pedestal Interface Unit (PIU), camera tracking system. The ACU specifications include:</p>
<p>&bull; 15" color touch screen<br />&bull; 1.2 GHz Pentium III processor<br />&bull; 512 MB RAM<br />&bull; 40 GB Hard Drive, 48X CD-ROM, 1.44 Mb Floppy <br />&bull; Ethernet (TCP/IP,UDP/IP), RS-232/422/485, and GPIB external interfaces<br />o ACU must interface with the PIU through fiber optic, multi-conductor cable or USB <br />&bull; Support conical scan feed, SCMP or E-scan<br />&bull; Front panel USB interfaces<br />&bull; Have the Edwards AFB Slaving System integrated into the ACU</p>
<p>TPS also requires a compact color charge-coupled device (CCD) camera with sun shield and camera system to include a monitor, video interface cables and mounting adapters in order to visually track takeoff and landing to prevent data loss due to Telemetry (TM) dropouts. Camera tracking systems are standard on all Range antenna assets and critical for mission data quality. The camera must have a &frac12;", .75mm, F1.8 on chip Microlens with auto iris, 32x zoom and must not require a control panel. The necessary power will be supplied from the pedestal and the video will be brought out via the slip ring assembly.</p>
<p>(b) The USAF TPS also requires the upgrade of the old 4 ft antenna dish and pedestal base to a 6 ft antenna dish, pedestal base and camera tracking. The new 6 ft antenna must be able to integrate and utilize the current pedestal interface unit (PIU), antenna control unit (ACU) and scan feed. TPS requires a 6 ft reflector with pedestal base and camera subsystem in order to telemeter student curriculum sorties. The current 4 ft antenna is efficient for only close-in sorties, such as ground checks, and does not have the gain required to track student curriculum sorties. The TPS also requires the following spare parts: pedestal I/F PCB for azimuth and elevation, motor encoder, NEMA 23 servo amplifier assembly, QS, and a dual output 115/230VAV power supply to serve as spares.</p>
<p>The upgrade only needs to replace the 4 ft reflector with a 6ft, pedestal base and install a camera subsystem. The pre-existing scan feed, ACU and PIU will be used. The new 6 ft reflector and pedestal base must integrate with the pre-existing scan feed, ACU and PIU. The new reflector must meet the following specifications:</p>
<p>&bull; 6 ft diameter reflector<br />&bull; Velocity minimum of 30 deg/sec<br />&bull; Backlash of 0.05 deg RMS<br />&bull; Greater than 29 dB gain @ 2400 MHz<br />&bull; AZ total travel continuous or &plusmn;410 deg<br />&bull; EL total travel of -5 deg to 185 deg<br />&bull; Operating temp range of -25 deg C to 55 deg C<br />&bull; Pedestal weight less than 120 lb<br />&bull; Wind speed operating 55 mph</p>
<p>Reflector and pedestal base must integrate with the current TPS PIU, conical scan feed and ACU designed by TCS, Inc.</p>
<p>This action will result in a purchase order to support the United States Test Pilot School. TCS is the only source identified for procurement of this service. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334220 and the size standard is 750.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by AFFTC. The point of contact is Lisa Jackson, AFFTC, Directorate of Contracting, 5 South Wolfe Avenue, Edwards AFB, CA 93524. Responses are due by 25 June, 5 p.m. local Pacific Time via email. Her email address is lisa.jackson@edwards.af.mil.</p>

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  <BR>2.  All proposals in response to this solicitation will be evaluated using streamlined source selection procedures as outlined in the Army Source Selection Manual and the policies and procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15.3.  A best value Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection process will be used for this requirement.   <BR>3.  An offeror who receives a rating of acceptable and has the lowest total evaluated price (including options) will be awarded the contract.<BR>4.  In order to receive a rating of acceptable your offer shall contain all of the information listed in established standards/factors under the technical proposal and in accordance with the PWS.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<BR>Factor 1:  Technical Capability/Management Approach <BR>Describe your technical capability and management approach to satisfying the requirement.  Your proposal shall include the following:<BR>a.  Organizational Structure and Communication:<BR> Outline your proposed organizational structure.  Explain the role of each team member/subcontractor/consultant, etc., as applicable to be used on for this requirement.  Describe your process for managing and controlling the team members, to include the subcontractors.  Discuss how reporting and review requirements will be imposed.

Address your approach to ensure effective lines of authority.  <BR>      Describe your team structure (to include utilization of subcontractors), the work/work area allocated to each team member.<BR>       b.  Affairs Legacy Knowledge:<BR>Describe your specialized experience and mastery of the principles, methods, practices and techniques of communication that will enable the offeror to function independently as a technical authority on public affairs topics.  The offeror must have recent (one year or less) of military public affairs experience with a thorough and proven understanding of strategic communications.  <BR>The offeror must have a Public Affairs product development knowledge base and   recognition within the advertising/public relations sector, the public affairs community and the military.  <BR>       c.

As a minimum, the methodology should address knowledge, skills, security clearances, education, and experience requirements.  Explain the availability of the personnel proposed and your plan in the event that they are not available to immediately commence work on the start date of the contract. <BR>Factor 2:  Past Performance:<BR>The offerors past performance will be evaluated considering the offerors relevant experience and quality of service, and will be assigned a risk rating of low, moderate or high.  An offeror must receive no higher than a moderate risk rating for the Past Performance Factor to be acceptable for an award.<BR>      a.  The offerors past performance will be evaluated as a measure of the Governments confidence in the likelihood of the offeror to successfully perform based on previous and current contract efforts.  The evaluation of past performance is a subjective assessment of the offerors performance on contracts of similar nature, size, scope, and complexity, utilizing a comparable number of personnel with like skills.  The Government will consider the offerors previous and current record of contractual performance.  In this context, offeror refers to the proposed prime contractor and major subcontractors.  <BR>     b.  The past performance experience and record of previous performance under similar or related contracts will be evaluated as an indicator of the offerors ability to perform the contract.  This experience must be relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation and gained by the offeror and proposed team members during the last three (3) calendar years from the proposal due date.   <BR>     c.  The Government will assess the offerors recent and relevant performance in accordance with FAR 15.305 based on services they are expected to perform.  The Government will evaluate:  quality of services; timeliness of performance; meeting schedule records; key personnel management; ability to provide quality personnel and adequate non-labor resources for the life of the contract; business relations including the achievement of small business goals and compliance with limitation of subcontracting (when applicable); cost control; effectiveness of internal and external communications; ability to understand and resolve deficiencies in a timely manner with no adverse impact on the mission and the program; general responsiveness to contract requirements; and customer satisfaction.  A significant achievement, problem, and how the problem was resolved are considerations that will impact the overall risk rating of the past performance factor.  A negative finding under any element may result in an overall high risk rating.  <BR>     d.  Relevant experience should be discussed for all subcontractors proposing to support this solicitation.  Your relevant experience shall be within the last three years.  For those offerors without records of relevant experience, a rating of unknown will be assigned and the offerors will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  <BR>     e.  The offeror must have a broad affiliate group within advertising, public relations, media, web, print, graphic design, event planning, video and photography on a local, regional, national and international basis.  Global network should already be established with proven success.

Additionally, information should be provided for any contract currently in the process of such terminations.  This information is required for any contract, similar or not to the proposed effort.<BR>Offerors are reminded that both independent data and data provided by offerors in their proposals may be used by the Government to evaluate the offerors past performance.  Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offeror to explain the relevance of the data provided.  The Government does not assume the duty to search for data to cure problems it finds in the proposal.  The burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information remains with the offerors.  Proposals NOT containing the information requested risk the assignment of unknown risk or a past performance risk rating of high by the Government.  An award will not be made to an offeror who receives a high past performance risk rating. <BR> Past Performance Reference.  The Government may interview references submitted by the contractors to validate relevancy and the quality of the performance.    <BR> Offerors shall include in their proposal the written consent of the proposed subcontractors to allow the Government to contact their references and discuss the subcontractors' past performance evaluation with the offeror during any discussions.  The Government will verify/validate information on both prime and subcontractors that an offeror provides in its proposal.<BR>     j.  If the past performance information is adverse, the offeror may be given an opportunity to provide a rebuttal if not previously provided such an opportunity.  <BR>     k.  The past performance proposal will be assigned a risk rating of low, moderate, high, or unknown.  An offeror whose proposal demonstrates no past performance will be rated unknown.  An award will not be made to any offeror who receives a high risk past performance rating.  The following risk assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of perceived risk and the probability of an offeror to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance.<BR>PAST PERFORMANCE RISK RATING:<BR>Low  Little doubt exits; Moderate  Some doubt exists; High  Significant doubt exists and Unkown  Little or no relevant past performance.<BR>Factor 3:   Price:   The price factor will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness of the price proposed for this requirement.  The evaluation will be performed on the total proposed estimated price, including the base performance period, and option periods.    Discuss the basis of estimate in terms of staffing proposed for each major section of the PWS (labor categories and number of hours) and rate determination methodology.   A rating will not be assigned to the Price Factor.  <BR>     a.  Completeness:  To be complete, the offeror shall provide all the data that is necessary to support the response.  The Government will assess the extent to which the price response complies with the content and format requirements set forth in this solicitation, and also exhibits traceability of estimates. <BR>    b.  Reasonableness:  The Government will evaluate proposed prices by performing the following assessments:  reviewing labor mix for compliance with Department of Labor Wage Determination (WD) and Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), if applicable; comparing total proposed prices with those of other offerors and the Independent Government Estimate (IGE); and comparing proposed labor mix and categories, with those submitted under Technical Response.   <BR>5.  Options:  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluations of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <BR>Basis For Award<BR>1.  The Government will evaluate this requirement using a best value, lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) approach.  Tradeoffs are not permitted and no additional credit is given for exceeding acceptability.  Proposals are evaluated to determine whether they meet the acceptability levels for all evaluation factors.      <BR> 2.  The Government intends to evaluate responses and award a contract without communications with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial response should contain its best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to make clarifications or request revised responses if later determined by the Contacting Officer to be necessary.  <BR>3.  The government will evaluate the offerors technical proposal to determine whether it satisfies the requirements of the PWS and is executable as proposed.  A determination will be rendered as to whether the technical proposal is Acceptable or Unacceptable based on the definitions below. <BR>Definitions of Ratings used for LPTA:<BR>     a.  ACCEPTABLE.  Meets all specified minimum performance, capability, qualification, certification, education, and/or security requirements necessary for satisfactory order performance.  Approach is sound and executable and performance risk is low to moderate.   <BR>        b.  UNACCEPTABLE.  A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency (ies) that indicate a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach as required by the PWS that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk: and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.        <BR><BR>    <BR><BR>

<DESC><p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the solicitation. The NAICS Code is 562910 with a size standard of $14 M. This procurement is a small business set aside. The reference number is H94003-09-T-0005. This requirement is to provide emergency response services to Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), 4234 54th St, McClellan, CA. The emergency response provider will provide containment, clean-up, remediation, and/or hazardous materials/waste when requested by DMEA. The purpose of this contract is to provide emergency response to DMEA in the event that these services would be required. The emergency response provider shall be required to provide containment, clean-up, remediation, and disposal of hazardous materials/waste resulting from a spill or release of any of the hazardous materials stored or processed at DMEA or transported from our facility to another site. Requirements: The emergency response contractor must have technically qualified personnel on the emergency response team. The personnel must be adequately trained and have sufficient experience to handle any type of spill or release that might be encountered at DMEA (see attached chemical list). This shall include the technical services of a certified industrial hygienist, chemist, environmental engineer, certified health physicist, etc. All emergency responders must have a minimum 40 hour HAZWOPER training (compliance with 29 CFR 1910.120 and CCR, Title 8, 5192), and 1 year experience of responding to various chemical spills within the state of California. At the direction of DMEA, the contractor will be required to respond to chemical spills/releases during the transportation of DMEA hazardous wastes or materials. This could include responses anywhere along the transportation routes and therefore the emergency contractor must have multiple emergency response teams that would be able to respond within a reasonable amount of time (3 hours or less). The contractor must have the capability to respond at the discretion of DMEA to emergencies any time the need arises. The requirement is for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week including holidays and weekends.

The emergency response service provider shall provide DMEA with a single call number that will activate an emergency response team with the capability to properly handle any type of spill/release that could be encountered at DMEA. DMEA must be able to speak with a "live" member of the emergency response team who is knowledgeable regarding hazardous materials and emergency response and not to a dispatch service (operator) who would have to contact others to response to technical questions. The person who answers the emergency telephone call shall have as a minimum 40 hour HAZWOPER training and one year experience responding to chemical spills. The emergency response time shall not be greater than three hours from the time the emergency response call is initiated by DMEA. The preference is to have the emergency response team on-site as soon as possible, but within 1 to 2 hours from the time the emergency response contractor is notified. All responders must comply with all federal, state, and local requirements including the mandated training requirements. The contractor shall not discuss the nature or extent of their involvement with any incident involving DMEA facility, chemicals, or processes with any other agencies (including the media) or other individuals without prior permission from DMEA. The contractor shall have liability insurance. The liability insurance shall be a minimum of $1,000,000 (USD). After the emergency contractor has responded to an incident, the contractor shall provide a written report within 48 hours to DMEA's Environmental, Health and Safety Manager. This report shall include the nature and extent of the spill/release, procedures to contain and/or mitigate the hazardous chemicals, notifications made to any agencies, results of any sampling or monitoring, and any other pertinent information related to the spill/release as deemed necessary by DMEA. It is anticipated this contract will be awarded as a time and materials contract. The duration of this contract will be for the initial year that the contract/agreement is consummated plus two option years. Proposal Submissions: A current emergency response price schedule shall be provided to DMEA Contracting (MEE). The price schedule shall include the labor rates for the different positions (e.g. certified industrial hygienist, chemist, technician, etc.), costs associated with the personal protective equipment (e.g. Level A suits, Tyvek suits, gloves, respirators, etc.), costs for various types of materials (e.g. overpack drums, booms, liners, etc.) and any other miscellaneous supplies or equipment. Provide the list of names of individuals with their education, experience and training as it pertains to emergency response for those who could be requested to respond to a chemical emergency at DMEA. Provide two examples of chemical emergencies that the contractor was called upon to mitigate. These examples shall include the nature and extent of the emergency response including the containment and clean up; however, for privacy reasons the contractor does not have include the name and location of the incident. Security: As a Department of Defense facility, access to DMEA is limited to authorized US citizens only. All emergency personnel responding to DMEA must be citizens of the United States of America. A list of names of the potential emergency responders must be provided in advance to DMEA and must be updated as necessary. Emergency response personnel may require a background check prior to working on-site. DMEA reserves the right to preclude access to our facility any of the contractor personnel for security concerns.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-09. The NAICS code is 611430. The Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) anticipates a single Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) type contract will be awarded to provide training support services for the National Training Center (NTC).  However, the Government reserves the right to make multiple awards.  The period of performance will be one year from date of contract award, with four (4) one year option periods, not to exceed a total of 5 years.  The services will be ordered through task orders containing Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Labor Hour (LH) contract line items (CLINS).  Task orders issued under this contract may be awarded using a Statement of Work (SOW) or a Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Each performance-based task order will include a performance requirements summary (PRS) table prepared by the government with related performance standards (acceptable quality) and performance measures (how performance will be measured).  The PRS table reflects the deliverables considered by FMCSA to be the most important for the successful performance of the task order.  In general, the PRS will set forth the expected outcomes (objectives) of the Task Order, the service(s) required of the contractor to attain the objectives, a performance standard per outcome, and a plan for incentives and dis-incentives in the event the contractor does/does not meet the performance standard.

In accordance with FAR 52.212-2, and the selection factors listed below as an addendum to FAR 52.212-2, the Government will award the contract to the responsible offeror or offerors whose offer, conforming to the solicitation requirements, is most advantageous and offers the best value to DOT/FMCSA.

All Contractor employees supporting this contract should meet the minimum education and experience requirements.  Include proposed names, resumes, and current responsibilities of all professional and support personnel, including that of subcontractors, proposed for this work and the experience of each as it relates to the requirements of this RFP. 2) Experience and Capability - Describe experience and ability to successfully meet or exceed the requirements of this SOW  illustrate how effective quality control processes and oversight will assure high caliber motor carrier safety and law enforcement training and support instrumental in achieving NTC organizational excellence.

Offeror proposals shall have three separate sections: Section 1 will include the response to Qualifications/Resumes and Experience and Capability; Section 2 will contain the response for Relevant Past Performance information; and Section 3 will contain the proposed Price information.  Evaluation of the option periods shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options. Offerors are required to submit at least three Relevant Past Performance references.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

The solicitation number AG-0120-S-09-0055 and this solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.

The following are this solicitation’s list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure:  001 – continuous strips of airborne LiDAR data

Description of requirements for the items to be acquired:  The purpose of the project is to re-acquire controlled airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data over a series of 121 forest inventory plots located on the western Kenai Peninsula.  The plots are roughly 150 meters in diameter each.  In addition to the 121 plots, LiDAR data will be collected over existing LiDAR data strips spaced approximately 9-km apart., oriented North-South (see attached detail).  The desire is for continuous strips of LiDAR data.  The priorities for LiDAR data acquisition are:  1) coverage over 121 previously flown FIA plots, 2) an effort to acquire complete (minimum of 95%) coverage over previous LIDAR strips, and 3) continuous strips (filling the gaps in the original data strips).  Specifications for the LiDAR acquisition are provided in table 1 in the attached document.  Ideally, LiDAR will be collected in leaf-off, but snow-free conditions in the fall of 2009, with collection of snow-free data over existing LiDAR data being the highest priority.  

The date for delivery is 21 business days after collection of LiDAR data.  Actual date of collection is based on phenology (foliage condition) and weather which cannot be controlled.  The intention is for the data to be collected in the fall of 2009, however, it is possible that the data may have to be collected in the Spring of 2010.  Shipping terms are FOB Origin.

The provision “52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items”, applies to this acquisition and the specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision, are as follows:  i.) Technical capability of service offered to meet the Government requirement; ii) Past Performance; iii) Price.   Technical and past performance when combined are significantly more important to price.

<DESC><p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency within the U.S.<br />Department of Transportation whose primary mission is to reduce deaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. This is accomplished by:<br />&bull; Setting and enforcing national safety performance standards for motor vehicles and equipment;<br />&bull; Researching and demonstrating promising strategies to influence positive traffic safety behaviors among diverse audiences;<br />&bull; Providing grants to state and local government to enable them to conduct effective local highway safety programs designed to reach diverse audiences; and<br />&bull; Planning and executing strategic communication campaigns to support program activity.</p>
<p>Research has demonstrated that increasing safety belt use and preventing impaired driving has a significant impact on meeting NHTSA's core mission and so continue to be two of the agency's priority programs. Innovative public information campaigns and highly visible law enforcement efforts have increased occupant protection use and decreased impaired driving.</p>
<p>Research has also demonstrated that despite the substantial progress we have made in reducing vehicle crashes and fatalities, motorcycle crashes are one of the main reasons NHTSA's progress in increasing highway safety has stalled.  For a decade, motorcycle fatalities and injuries have steadily increased.  In fact, they have more than doubled since 1997.  These increases have essentially offset the decreases in NHTSA's overall fatality and injury numbers that are released annually.</p>
<p>To meet its mission of decreasing fatalities and injuries on our Nations' roadways, NHTSA must continue to develop English and Spanish language messaging and materials on seat belts, impaired driving, motorcycles, pedestrians, bicycles, school buses, and older driver safety, distracted driving, and other NHTSA-based communication initiatives. In addition, the Agency needs to have the ability to develop new communication strategies and initiatives in response to traffic safety problems as they are identified in an annual review of the Agency's data.</p>
<p>The purpose of this multiple-year contract is to acquire integrated communications marketing/advertising services from the Contractor.  In fulfilling this contract's requirements, the Contractor shall utilize its: 1) social marketing experience; 2) experience and knowledge of the Hispanic population; 3) ability to adapt existing materials into Spanish, and create new materials that will positively resonate with Spanish speaking populations; and 4) strategic and tactical development and execution experience.  The contractor shall provide NHTSA with public relations and communications support in the development of English and Spanish language communications, marketing campaigns, and related tools.  This support will  be used by  NHTSA's partners, the States, and highway safety advocates throughout the United States to promote traffic safety messages; raise traffic safety awareness; and increase positive traffic safety behaviors among English and Spanish speaking populations through information dissemination and strategically designed program initiatives relating to seat belts, impaired driving, motorcycles, pedestrians, bicycles, school buses, older driver safety, and other NHTSA-based communication initiatives as they are identified in an annual review of the Agency's data.</p>
<p><strong>INTENT</strong></p>
<p>This procurement will be an 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement. This procurement is a Time and Materials (T&amp;M) contract. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541820. The period of performance is estimated at 5 years with Option Periods.</p>
<p><strong>PROCUREMENT</strong></p>
<p>Attached is the Solicitation document with all relevant material.  All offerors must ensure they follow Sections L &amp; M when submitting proposals.  Questions will be accepted until June 29 at 4pm EST.  Other details for submission are found in the Solicitation.</p>

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334515 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  In accordance with the Non-Manufacturer Rule, to qualify under a small business set-aside, the distributor and the manufacturer must qualify as a Small Business under the NAICS code identified above.


***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for an Electrical Scanning Probe to be used in Center for Nanoscale Science & Technology at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. ***

Development of instrumentation for the nanoscale characterization of processes related to energy conversion, storage and transport is one of the main thrusts of Center for Nanoscale Science & Technology. The proposed new acquisition of an Electrical Scanning Probe compatible with the existing multi-probe system will enable a comprehensive electro-optical nanoscale analysis of photovoltaic materials and solar cells. 

The Electrical Scanning Probe is intended for nanoscale electrical measurements and has to be compatible with the existing Multiview 400 multi-probe NSOM/AFM system.  The current multi-probe system has completely free vertical optical axis (both above and below the sample) and two optical microscopes (upright and inverted, respectively). With the addition of the new scanning electrical probe, the multi-probe system will be used for advanced electro-optical characterization of photovoltaic materials. 

***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s):

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Each, Electrical Scanning Probe.

The contractor shall meet or exceed the following specifications: 

Minimum Specifications
1.	The electrical scanning probe shall be compatible with the open vertical optical axis and with multi-probe operation of the existing system. It shall fit within the environmental chamber enclosure.
a.	In the working position, the probe shall occupy a sector with angle less than 30 deg within 20 mm distance from the optical axis and a sector with angle less than 75 deg for the rest of the probe length.
b.	In the working position, the probe height shall be less than 45 mm within 20 mm from the optical axis and less than 80 mm for the rest of the probe length.
c.	Hardware required for mounting the probe to the base plate and electrical feedthroughs shall be provided.

2.	The scanning probe (hereafter referred to as “SP”) shall be able to act both as an Electrical Probe (EP) with force feedback and as an atomic-force-microscope (AFM).  In addition to the fine scanning capabilities necessary for EP and contact AFM operation and non-contact AFM operation, coarse positioning capabilities are also required for the SP.  
a.	SP fine scanning should be achieved via a piezoelectric positioning in both lateral (x and y) and vertical (z) directions.

Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) o Outside the United States. 
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] 
[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that— 
(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;

(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; 
(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); 
(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and 
(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) 
(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 
(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror’s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.

INTRODUCTION

As part of OPS, the OFDA Safety and Security Coordinator (SSC) and Safety and Security Specialist (SSS) play a central role in the U.S. Government’s (USG’s) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management programs.  The Safety and Security Unit (SSU) assists the office in identifying, evaluating and mitigating safety and security risks to OFDA field operations.  The SSU monitors security issues and events, develops security strategies, protocols and procedures, and maintains a cadre of qualified security professionals available for OFDA deployments.  The OFDA SSU also promotes enhanced safety and security approaches in the wider humanitarian community, including NGOs and United Nations (UN) agencies, through their outreach and donor activities.

OBJECTIVE

OPS requires the services of a Safety and Security Specialist in order to enhance its capability to manage the increasing safety and security issues related to OFDA field deployments.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

•	Monitor security situations in countries and regions in which OFDA has, or may have, staff.
•	Provide general and country-specific security guidance and briefings to OFDA staff as needed.
•	Conduct periodic site visits in support of OFDA/DRM and Regional Team safety and security needs, including comprehensive safety and security assessments and development of safety and security plans.
•	Work with OFDA’s Training Unit to refine and develop security related training materials as needed.  
•	Assist in managing OFDA’s cadre of Safety and Security Officers.
•	Working with OFDA/DRM, assist in the identification and evaluation of humanitarian security initiatives to increase NGO and UN capacity to improve their overall security management. 
•	Work with OFDA/DRM and Regional Teams to coordinate and track the activities of OFDA staff as they relate to security.
•	Liaise with USAID Office of Security, Department of State Diplomatic Security, other USG agencies, UN, and NGO offices on the issue of staff safety and security, as appropriate.  This may include participation in inter-agency security fora.  Establish relationships with other relevant organizations such as the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), and the UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS).  
•	Serve on OFDA Response Management Teams (RMT) and Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DART) as Safety and Security Officer (or other positions), as required.
•	Manage OFDA’s Duty Officer program.
•	Manage OFDA’s Security Information distribution lists.
•	Become a certified Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative/Agreement Officer’s Technical Representative and assist in the management of security-related grants, cooperative agreements and contracts.
•	Assist DART Safety and Security Officers with development of deployment-specific Security Plans. 
•	Serve as OFDA Duty Officer on a rotational basis.  

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The OFDA Safety and Security Specialist will report directly to the Safety and Security Coordinator, who in turn reports to the OPS Division’s Field Support Team Leader.  He/she will work closely with USAID/SEC (Office of Security), in order to ensure consistency with overall USAID security objectives and the sharing of information between OFDA and SEC.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The incumbent is expected to take initiative, work in a collaborative manner, yet able to act independently, and perform with minimal direction in responding to humanitarian emergencies as part of a fast-paced office environment.  The supervisor will set overall objectives.  The Safety and Security Specialist will work with the Safety and Security Coordinator to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be done.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<p>Bit Synchronizer outputs NRZ-L data with clock and three soft decision bits for I&amp;Q channels:<br />The RCB-4000 does not have soft decision output as a standard.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Correct the Bit Synchronizer is an "OPTION" that we require on the RCB-4000.</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>De-interleaver - in or out (10 Mbps Maximum).</p>
<p>The RCB-4000 Bit synchronizer has a Interleaver function, not a De-interleaver. The maximum output rate of the interleaver is 20Mbs.</p>
<p>Answer: Once again this is part of the Bit Synchronizer "OPTION" that we require on the RCB-4000.</p>
<p>The RCB-4000 programmable bit synchronizer specifications identifies it as an De-interleaver.</p>

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration is seeking quotations for a Collaborative Workspace Application for a base period plus two option years.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a small business set aside.

The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-09-1055518 and is being issued as a small business set aside. 

The NAICS code is 511210 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The Government intends to issue a fixed price purchase order for a base plus two option years and reserves the right to issue an award without discussions.  

The Statement of Work is included as an attachment.

Price:
The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a base period plus two option years.  Consulting hours will be evaluated based on the maximum number of hours.  Price is of less importance than technical capabilities.  Award will not be automatically made on the basis of the highest technical merit. However price may become an important factor as the degree of equality between technical proposals becomes closer.  FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990) applies to this procurement.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

•The proposal demonstrates that the functionality of the product meets the desirable requirements listed in Section 2.1 (Mandatory and Desirable Features).  Desirable requirements will be evaluated only if the product(s) meet all mandatory requirements.    

**Note to contractors**-- add a third column to the existing tables (which can be found on page 3 of the attachment) and use that space to specify if you support the requirement, and how.  “How” can be through an explanation or reference to specific locations (pages) in documentation.  Contractors can provide the documentation or reference it on a web site.  

Customer Support
•The proposal demonstrates the capability to address the support requirements specified in Section 2.3 (Maintenance, Support & Upgrades)    
•The proposed Service Level Agreement meets the minimum requirements specified in Section 2.3 and describes the services above and beyond the minimum.

Consulting Services

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address questions posed.
Q: When do we get access to load in to the Lincoln Ballroom?  
A: Monday morning, September 21, 2009.
Q: Do you have a rehearsal/presenter review time planned? 
A: We would like to have the room set and ready for run-thru by 3pm on the 21st.
Q: Would you like us to provide presentation computers for the General Session/Awards? 
A:Yes, please provide these but price them separately.
Q:  Would you like us to provide PowerPoint technical support for any changes/revisions to presentations? 
A: No.
Q: Is there any recording of the breakout rooms required? 
A: No.
Q: There is no line item for labor in the template provided.  Is it acceptable to create line item 0008 to list the labor charges?
A: The contracting office can not advise you of how to prepare your proposal.
Q: In regards to theatrical lighting flown from truss: The only lighting detailed in the RFQ is for a Gobo.  This is normally a single lighting instrument dedicated to the Gobo.  Is there a lighting clause that was omitted? 
A: You are correct about the lighting requirements.  We will not be using theatrical lighting for this event but are asking about this qualification as a way of evaluating the experience level of the vendors. No lighting clauses were omitted.
Q: In regards to Video Playback on DVcam:  No DVcam is specified in the equipment list, only DVD is specified.  Was the DVcam omitted? 
A: The video playback will be from DVDs only.  DV Cam is not required.
Q: The RFQ specifies no scenic elements. Am I to understand that there will be elements provided by others? 
A: We are likely to use only plain staging with the exception of perhaps some black pipe and drape. Vendors may make recommendations for scenic elements but these should be priced separately.
Q: No teleprompting equipment is requested.  Will the IRS provide the equipment and need a technician to operate it? 
A: We will not be using a teleprompter.
Q: No uplink or downlink equipment is requested.  Should we be anticipating such a requirement. 
A: It is possible but unlikely.  If satellite becomes a new requirement we will make a contract modification.
Q: No webcasting is requested.  Should we anticipate this requirement?
A: No.
Q: What is the due date & time for proposal submissions?
A: FRIDAY, JUNE 12, 2009 AT 4:00 PM EST. LATE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.
Q: How should I submit my proposal?
A: Proposals can be submitted via email to Bridgette.Otero@irs.gov or via fax to (202) 283-1365. They can also be mailed to Bridgette Otero at 6009 Oxon Hill Road, Suite 900, Oxon Hill, MD 20745. Note that proposals must be RECEIVED no later than 4:00 PM EST on Friday, JUne 12, 2009. LATE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. Bridgette Otero will send an email confirming receipt with the date & time that your quote was received.

<DESC>Modification 1 - Questions and Answers to the RFP:

This is a modification to incorporate the answers to questions submitted to the RFP.  All questions and answers are listed below:

Questions Regarding RFP Number: HSHQDC-09-R-00081

1. Section II on page 1 of the SOW describes two scenarios for standoff radiation detection. In both scenarios, the detection systems are only required to monitor one side of the screening vessel. Is it necessary or desirable for the system to monitor both sides of the screening vessel simultaneously?

A: DNDO will consider systems that monitor either one or both sides of the screening vessel. Systems that monitor both sides are preferable for operational flexibility

2. Section III on page 3 of the SOW states that “the contractor shall ship two examples of each radiation detection system selected for participation in the laboratory evaluation to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)”. What is the expected lead time for delivery of the two systems?

A: It is anticipated that BPAs will be issued the week of 17 July 09 and must be delivered to ORNL by 27 July 09 to participate in testing tentatively scheduled 3 August to 4 September 09.

3. Section IV on page 3 of the SOW states that “Each of the detection system components should weigh less than 50 pounds and the total system (combined components) should fit within a deck foot print of 9 square feet”. Please clarify the meaning of “components” in this context. Can the delivered system consist of several components, with no weight limitation on the overall system?

A: A detection module, operator interface, multi-channel analyzer, and computer would each be considered components, if separately packaged. The weight limit is applied to each component.. There is no limitation to the number of components or combined weight of the entire system provided it all fits into 9 square feet as specified.

4. Section 2.4.I of the RFP (page 8) states that “unless selected by DNDO for purchase, the equipment will be returned to the manufacturer, in the condition the equipment is in at the conclusion of the laboratory testing”. If selected for Phase III/Field Testing, will DNDO purchase the equipment which was previously delivered to ORNL for Environmental and Characterization Testing?

A: DNDO will not purchase systems prior to environmental and characterization testing. DNDO will pay for shipping and training of operator personnel at ORNL. If a system is selected for participation in field testing it will be procured. The system will either be the system that participated in the environmental testing or the same model/version shipped from the vendor. DNDO will specify which system is to be purchased in the delivery order.

5. Section IV on page 3 of the SOW states “DNDO seeks two classes of radiation detection systems for this application. Both classes of radiation detectors must be
useable on a small vessel defined as approximately twenty-five (25) feet in length, similar to the type used by law enforcement patrols at harbors.” Can DNDO provide more information on the likely mounting method and location of radiation-detection equipment on the screening vessel, for both portable and integrated classes of systems?

A: The portable class intended operational use is to be hand-carried onto a boat, secured and connected to power etc. prior to each use. Mounting brackets and other interface fixtures such as 12VDC power connectors may be permanently installed on the boat to improve the safety and security of the mount and to reduce the time required to install for each mission.
The integrated class intended operational use is to be installed on the boat in a permanent fashion and hard wired into the boat’s 12VDC power system. Cable runs needed for display and control equipment will also be permanently installed.

6. Table 2 on page 13 of the RFP requests information on the system power supply requirements if connected to an external source. Can DNDO provide the available voltage, type (AC or DC), and current of the vessel power supply?

A. For the purposes of the field test event DNDO intends to use the 12 VDC power system currently installed on the test boats. At this time DNDO does not have specific information on current limits for each boat. The manufacturer should provide the power and voltage requirements for their systems and DNDO will ensure that clean power of the needed type (DC or AC), voltage, and current are available. Systems that can operate solely from 12VDC are preferred. During field testing DNDO can provide 120VAC if needed for systems selected for field testing

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

<DESC>SYNOPSIS: Project 030018. This RESTRICTED ACQUISITION is set aside for HUBzone concerns. The  Period of Performance is 90 calendar days.

NAICS CODE: 236220. Size Standard $33.5M  Demolish Spray Pond, Project Number 030018.  The spray pond consists of a 113’ x 208’ concrete slab area with retaining walls where four rows of piping conducted air cooled water to cool high velocity air that created mach conditions in the wind tunnel complex.  The wind tunnels have been demolished and the spray pond is no longer needed.  The concrete spray pond, fencing, spray headers and piping, pump houses, and asbestos piping insulation will be demolished and the remaining area graded for proper drainage and seeded. The site of the work is Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS:  A hazardous material contractor experienced in asbestos abatement will be required for this project.  Other than hazardous material abatement activities, this project is straightforward but will have the normal scheduling, coordination and safety problems for the contractor.  Failure to supervise and coordinate the different trades required to provide a quality and timely product will be unacceptable.
Estimated Magnitude of Proposed Acquisition is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.
 In accordance with FAR 4.1102 and DFARS 252.204-704 "Required Central Contractor Registration," Contractor must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov/ , or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax: 1-703-696-0213.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) has a requirement to perform an Organizational Alignment (OA) study to determine options for DESC to implement an Alternative Fuels/Renewable Energy (AF/RE) Office/focus in support of ongoing and newly emerging AF/RE mission requirements.  In addition to the OA for the AF/RE Office, phase II will be performed to review/assess the current DESC organizational structure to determine the best alignment to meet current/future requirements.  The OA is to be utilizing the following phased approach:  

Phase I will provide a recommended office structure that supports meeting alternative fuels and renewable energy requirements for DESC in the short-term.  

Phase II will address options pertaining to how DESC will align itself organizationally to support current and emerging energy related mission requirements as well as determine the best organization fit for supporting DESC’s planned migration into the Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing (SAP) Enterprise Business Solution (EBS) scheduled FY 2012.

New mission requirements will require DESC to perform an enterprise-wide organizational alignment (to include the Regions) to determine where gaps and seams exist between current organization capability and the future requirements.  This requirement must be developed in accordance with the DLA One Book Guidance for Enterprise Organizational Alignment (EOA). These techniques will include, but not be limited to, eliminating obsolete practices; consolidating functions or activities; reengineering and restructuring organizations, functions, or activities; and adopting industry best business practices.

Request for proposals are due July 1, 2009 at 3:00 pm Eastern Standard Local Time.

<CONTACT>John Inman, Contract Officer, Phone 907-228-6231, Fax 907-228-6254, Email jinman@fs.fed.us - A Kay Steffey, Contracting Officer, Phone 907-747-4273, Email ksteffey@fs.fed.us
<DESC>**************************************************************************************************************
On April 27, 2009, the Forest Service conducted a conference with interested parties regarding an Environmental Impact Statement for the Wrangell Island Ten-Year Timber Sale.  That conference was advertised on FedBizOpps, and the minutes were posted soon afterwards.  Note that this matter is only for an EIS, not for the timber sale itself, as no decision has been made to implement the timber sale.  The EIS is needed as part of the decision-making process regarding the timber sale.

At this time, the Forest Service contemplates obtaining the needed services from one of the General Services Administration’s Multiple Award Schedule contracts (FAR Subpart 8.4).  We contemplate adapting the multi-step advisory process described in FAR 15.202 to work with a FAR Subpart 8.4 acquisition.  In Step 1, we contemplate releasing a Statement of Objectives which describes our desired outcomes to three or more schedule contractors (perhaps using the GSA Advantage! on-line service and GSA Schedule 899) and asking interested schedule contractors to submit information that will allow the Forest Service to advise each responding schedule contractor of its potential to be a viable competitor.  Each responding schedule contractor will provide an overview of its (i) technical approach; (ii) experience, competence, and capability; (iii) past performance; and (iv) other appropriate factors including proposed project phasing and ball-park pricing.  After our evaluation of the responses, the Forest Service will advise each responding schedule contractor that it will be invited to participate in Step 2 or that, based on the information submitted, it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  In Step 2, we contemplate releasing a solicitation (again, perhaps using the GSA Advantage! on-line service) asking for firm-fixed-price proposals from schedule contractors with more detailed technical, qualifications, and past performance information than was provided in Step 1.

We contemplate releasing the dollar amount we have budgeted for this effort.  The purpose of this release of information is not to fix the price which contractors must meet; rather, we hope to help responding schedule contractors appropriately scope their efforts to fit within the funds that are available.  For example, if the released budget estimate amount is $3 Million, all schedule contractors will be on notice that the Forest Service isn’t really interested in $9 Million proposals.  We hope we can obtain our desired outcomes within the amount we have made available, and will seek a best-value solution for an amount not exceeding the released amount.

We intend to allow schedule contractors maximum flexibility is scoping, crafting, and otherwise shaping their proposals.  It is possible that contractors will propose differing technical or programmatic phases, differing contract line item number (CLIN) structures, and so forth.  However, we will want for each responding schedule contractor to fully understand and provide our desired outcomes in a firm-fixed-price arrangement. 

We are most sincerely interested in thoughts from potential offerors on this approach, and we invite any interested party to share its thoughts in a brief white paper.  We are not interested in marketing information at this time; we are interested at this time primarily and indeed almost solely on thoughts regarding the approach described above.  An interested party may provide any insights as it may choose, but we hope white papers will include comments on (1) use of the General Services Administration’s Multiple Award Schedule contracts; (2) use of a two-step advisory process; (3) giving contractors flexibility on planning and phasing the work; and (4) release of the budgeted amount as a help to offerors in scoping proposals which meet the Forest Service’s need and provide a best-value solution.

Please provide your white papers as text within an e-mail (no attachments, please) by close of business on THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 2009 to jinman@fs.fed.us with cc: to pheuer@fs.fed.us.

<DESC>This procurement is an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) opportunity at the Naval Submarine Base New London (NSBNL), Groton, Connecticut.  The proposed site is comprised of paved and unimproved area totaling approximately 4.34 acres.  The site available for lease is located at the southeast ("SE") corner of NSBNL at the intersection of Crystal Lake Road and Route 12.  NSBNL is on the east bank of the Thames River, partially located in both, the Town of Groton, Connecticut and the Town of Ledyard, Connecticut, approximately 55 miles from Providence, RI, 50 miles from New Haven, CT, and 55 miles from Hartford, CT.  The EUL site is located within the fence line of NSBNL, which is a closed base, not open to the general public.  Ingress and egress to the site could potentially be obtained from public roads Route 12 or Crystal Lake Road by repositioning the existing security fence.
Procurement Process:
The Navy is seeking a lessee to establish, operate and maintain a retail/recreational development that will enhance the quality of life for Navy personnel and the surrounding community and serve as the primary economic driver of the site in exchange for in-kind-consideration not less than the fair market value of the leasehold interest in the real property.

____________________________6/11/09Amendment 1:  Answers to Questions
1)I have a quick question regarding notice # N40085-09-R-0206, and I was hoping that you could help me.  By any chance is this requirement a follow-on to contract # N40085-05-R-1005?  This requirement is not a follow-on contract.
2) Is there a page limit for the SF 330 submittal?  No.
3)  Can you please confirm that the due date for submittals is July 10, 2009?  Within the text of the solicitation (bottom of page 3) it states that all responses are due by May 30, 2008.  The synopsis has been revised to read the correct date, submittals are due July 10, 2009 at 2:00 p.m.

<DESC>DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)<BR>For<BR>JOINT IED DEFEAT ORGANIZATION (JIEDDO) COUNTER-IED OPERATIONS INTEGRATION CENTER (COIC)<BR>Irregular Warfare Analysis (IWA)<BR><BR>1.0  SCOPE.  This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the scope of irregular warfare analysis (IWA) activities needed to support Operational level military operations, intelligence and operations research systems analysis for deployed U.S. and coalition forces in Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) operations both in support of all U.S. Combatant Command Areas of Responsibility and other locations in the United States.  IWA support is required for 42 specific positions, including 12 forward positions, as distributed in paragraph 4.0 below.  The required level of effort may be expanded up to a total of 75 positions per year.  The contractor is responsible for overall management of the contract, including all options exercised, and insuring that the technical solutions and schedules are implemented in a timely manner.  The contractor will review task performance and work products for correctness as well as adherence to design concepts and user requirements, and for progress in accordance with schedules.  The contractor will ensure that evolving requirements of the client are met, including long range planning, technology insertion, personnel management, training, and product development.<BR><BR><BR>2.0	BACKGROUND.  <BR><BR>	2.1  Mission.  The Joint Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) is a Deputy Secretary of Defense directed initiative with the mission to rapidly provide solutions to defeat the Enemys IED Campaign and save service members lives deployed fighting the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).  The JIEDDO Counter-IED Operations Integration Centers (COIC) uses IWA to support Attack-the-Network counter IED analysis.  The COIC mission includes employment of advanced analysis of tactics, techniques, and procedures, along with an expert understanding of insurgent unconventional warfare, to conduct event-based associative analysis of individuals, cells, network command and control, and logistics.  Essentially, this adds an understanding of how and when events occur to the traditional intelligence disciplines (HUMINT, SIGINT, MASINT, IMINT) as described in Appendix A.  This provides for a unique, mature, tailored level of analysis of insurgent IED operational networks and operating patterns, events, and activities that complements layers produced by COIC Comprehensive Look and Discovery Teams, or responds directly to gaps identified by warfighting units.<BR><BR>	2.2  Current Methodology.  Current IWA support to the COIC has been provided by the CALEB Analysis Methodology, an analytical process developed and fielded by a JIEDDO funded Proof of Concept that was integrated by the Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO)  a program office under the Assistant Secretary of Defense (ASD) for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict and Interdependent Capabilities (SO/LIC & IC).  This specific type of analysis has provided intelligence fusion and a common operating/intelligence picture for critical, relevant, and effectual pattern analysis on insurgent-based operations in mapping out cells and networks to fight the GWOT.  This methodology is a select application of collective analysis techniques and methodologies supported by U.S. Army Special Forces centric in-depth understanding of insurgent-based irregular warfare.  It applies core competencies of irregular warfare to event-based information by advanced data mining, data fusion, predictive pattern analysis, geo-profiling and temporal analysis.  The resulting customized process, provided a system-based analysis of insurgent networks that defines the threat environment and provides battlespace awareness at the tactical level (key nodes, functional mechanisms, direction, flow, and operational patterns.)  This proved to be of critical, effectual and relevant value to enabling the JIEDDO and COIC missions.<BR><BR>3.0   SERVICES REQUIRED.<BR><BR>3.1  Reach Back Analytical Support.  The contractor shall provide reach back analysis support through Irregular Warfare (IW) analysts operating at designated support locations. The IW analysts shall service the JIEDDO COIC and unit requests for support (RFSs) by conducting operational analysis on insurgent organizations. The IW analysts shall employ the Irregular Warfare Analysis (IWA) methodology and proven software tools to accomplish data mining, data fusion, predictive pattern analysis, geo-profiling techniques, and temporal analysis techniques. The collective analysis techniques and methodologies coupled with the irregular warfare analysis and COIC toolsets are to be applied with an expert understanding of insurgent-based unconventional warfare. Specific resources the contractor shall exploit will include, but will not necessarily be limited to, open source and classified data bases, reports, and message traffic searches as required.<BR><BR>Specifically:<BR>  <BR>"	Each analyst shall be trained to provide IW analytical support IAW the approved IWA Methodology. <BR><BR>"	All analysts must have a clearance of TS/SCI as a condition of employment. <BR><BR>"	The contractor shall maintain a JIEDDO COIC approved level of experienced Special Forces Trained Unconventional Warfare subject matter experts (SME) - 18F Trained, level III ASO Analysts trained in the IWA Methodology to apply IWA Methodology standardization, continuity, and sustain analytical product quality.   <BR><BR>"	By servicing appropriate RFSs the IWA personnel shall engage in a systematic identification and analysis of insurgent cells and networks germane or in some way associated with employing or facilitating IEDs.  Analysts shall initially focus on classified sources. The contractor shall be prepared to add additional information sources of interest on a rolling basis as required by JIEDDO COIC.<BR><BR>"	With oversight from proper Government authorities, the contractor may be required to operate secure facilities in designated anonymous locales.  Unclassified and classified IT and communications support and maintenance will be provided by the government.  <BR><BR>"	The IWA analysts shall focus on data that informs of the existence, organization, and operation of terrorist and insurgent networks.  Data that provides insight into but not limited to technical, tactical, operational and strategic capabilities shall be sought.  Specific data to be analyzed include, but are not necessarily limited to:<BR>o	Information on network structures, including the identification of individuals, relationships between various individuals and groups, organizational constructs, and other relevant data.  This shall further include their names, nicknames, locations, affiliations, technical proficiency, levels of training, and positions within a network or community.<BR>o	Information on terrorist operational capabilities, including tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs); cover and deception methods; targeting strategies; and surveillance methods.<BR>o	Information on terrorist technologies, including raw materials, manufacturing processes, supply chains, usage intentions, and any identified operational opportunities for the U.S. Government.<BR>o	Individuals contributing or offering support to terrorist and/or insurgent groups who possess technical knowledge or training in the fields of chemistry, explosives, electronics, weapon design, structural engineering, microbiology, document forgery, and surveillance.<BR>o	Individuals contributing or offering support to terrorist and/or insurgent groups who possess logistical information, such as bank accounts, other networks, safe houses, and secret routes into and out of countries where IEDs are prevalent. <BR>o	Identification of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and other information that may lead to the whereabouts of individuals of interest or concern.<BR> <BR>	3.2  Predictive Analysis.  The contractor shall be prepared to provide predictive analysis specific to likely evolutions in adversary Insurgent TTP and operations.  The contractor shall form this IW analysis based upon a combination of assessing of past terrorist trends and adaptations and factoring in current adversary intent, constraints, capabilities, and likely targets at an operational level.  By assuming the adversary mindset in this manner and coupling it with the IWA Insurgent/Unconventional methodology, the contractor shall develop notional lessons learned from past precedents; the contractor shall develop notional concepts of operations and courses of action that best represent likely adversary activity.  The contractor shall prepare analytic products.  IWA personnel shall prepare analytic products to inform JIEDDO COIC and supported units of relevant findings and assessments resulting from the full scope of insurgent analysis.<BR><BR>	3.3  Special Forces Irregular Warfare Analyst, Liaison Officers.

<a href="mailto:darlene.rideout@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Natick</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Contracting Center (US Army RDEC), Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA released a synopses on May 11, 2009 regarding Solicitation W911QY-09-R-0033.  In that synopsis, it was inadvertently stated that the acquisition would be 100% small business set aside.   The purpose of this synopsis is to obtain information as to whether or not there are small businesses that can support this effort.  Based on the information received, a determination will be made as to whether or not the procurement will be issued as a  small business set-aside. Additionally, the original effort that was synopsized has been changed to include the U.S. Army effort along with the U.S. Marine Corps effort as described in this synopsis.  In support of the Joint Service Anthropometric Survey (JSAS) Program Office, The US Army RDEC Natick Contracting Division has a requirement for the conduct of an anthropometric survey of U.S. Marine Corp (USMC) active duty and reserve personnel; and the U.S. Army (USA) active duty, reserve personnel, and National Guard.  The purpose of this contract will be to develop and execute all activities necessary to conduct the surveys, deliver the resulting USMC and USA anthropometric databases and summary statistics, and produce a final report on the project.  The effort will result in comprehensive anthropometric databases that can be used to represent the current USMC and USA populations for design, sizing, and tariffing of USMC and USA clothing and equipment; computer aided design of workstations, workspaces, and vehicles; and three dimensional (3D) solid modeling of body curvatures and shapes for enhanced personnel protective equipment.  The government envisions a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, which would require a contractor to have an adequate cost accounting system.U.S. Marine Corps Effort - The last comprehensive survey of Marines occurred in 1966.  Since then, there have been significant changes in body size and shape across the population.  Since 1994, the USMC has used statistically matched Army anthropometric data from the landmark 1988 ANSUR database for design, sizing and tariffing.  However, current Army-Marine Corps body size differences have become so great that modeling Marines using Army data is now unwise.  In addition, no 3D scan data exists on the USMC population for design and modeling applications.  For these reasons, the USMC requires its own comprehensive anthropometric database.  The contractor will directly and physically measure 90 standardized body dimensions on each of 3,600 Marines using traditional measurement tools and methods and in addition collect a 3D head/face scan and a 3D whole body scan on each Marine using scanners to be supplied by the Government.  The 3,600 Marines will be selected from approximately three (3) USMC installations to render statistically valid, representative samples of males and females from Active Duty and Reserve components. The contractor will provide a Methods and Summary Statistics report for clothing and equipment design guidance along with a database comprising subject demographic data, traditional body measurements and archived scan images.  U.S. Army Effort - The last comprehensive survey of Soldiers was the landmark 1988 Anthropometric Survey (ANSUR).  There have been significant anthropometric changes in the Active Duty population since 1988 and statistically significant anthropometric differences between Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard populations due to race/ethnicity and age factors.  Todays Active Duty males are, on average, only 4.4 mm taller, but 5.2 kg heavier than in 1988; Active Duty females are 8.9 mm taller and 7.4 kg heavier than in 1988. The 1988 ANSUR database cannot represent todays heavier soldier population, even with statistical weighting to correct for changes in demographic distributions.  The contractor will directly and physically measure 90 standardized body dimensions on each of approximately 12,000 Soldiers using traditional measurement tools and methods and in addition collect a 3D head/face scan and a 3D whole body scan on each Soldier using scanners to be supplied by the Government.  The 12,000 Soldiers will be selected from approximately eleven (11) US Army installations to render statistically valid samples of males and females from Active Duty, Reserve and National Guard components. The contractor will provide a Methods and Summary Statistics report for clothing and equipment design guidance along with a database comprising subject demographic data, traditional body measurements and archived scan images. The Surveys - The surveys will be executed in three phases: 1) Preparation and Validation of Methods, 2) Data Collection and Editing and, 3) Database Development and Reporting.  Each phase is comprised of several major tasks.  The first phase, Preparation and Validation of Methods, requires the development and validation of all methods, processes, technologies and documents to be used in the conduct of the survey. These include development of the measurement list, landmarks and instrumentation; establishment of the measuring sequence of body dimensions; development, integration, and validation of traditional and 3D data entry and quality control software and operational protocols.  It is envisioned that the USA survey will utilize the same methods & protocols as the USMC survey.  The second phase, Data Collection and Editing, requires selection and training of the measuring team; collection of demographic data, 90 traditional measurements and 3D whole body and head/face scans on each subject; implementation of standardized, validated on-site protocols for subject selection, processing, data quality and security; and overall management of hardware and software systems. The second phase of the USA survey will be executed immediately following the second phase of the USMC survey with the same measuring team to the extent possible.  The third phases, Database Development and Reporting, require final data editing, development of the anthropometric databases, publishing of summary statistics and submission of a final project report.  The estimated period of performance for the contractual effort is 28 months from date of award.  The effort is unclassified.  However, because data collection will take place on military installations, no foreign nationals may be assigned to this project.  After reading the scope of work above, please provide a white paper (5-page limit) responding to the following questions (include supporting documentation as applicable): 1) What qualifications/capabilities do you have to execute the required work? 2) What experience or past performance of a similar nature supports your qualifications/ capabilities for the required work? Ensure the following is addressed in your response  a.  traditional physical measuring and 3D scanning experience and the scope of previous data collection efforts b. Please indicate the dollar range of any related contracts, 3) Is your firm a small business? 4) If this project were set-aside for small business, would you submit a bid proposal? 5) If this project were set-aside for small business, would you submit a bid proposal if in your range? 6) Is your firm a certified HUBZONE firm? 7) Is your firm a certified 8(a) firm?  Email only responses are requested by 12:00 EST 23 June 2009 and should be forwarded to Ms. SL Rawls at SL.Rawls@us.army.mil, phone number is 508-233-6251.  This document will assist the Government in determining if this acquisition will be set aside for small businesses.  Failure to answer any above questions may result in a determination of capability for purposed of this survey.  This is not a Request for Proposal.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990.

<CONTACT>Regina Brecht, 309-782-0140

<a href="mailto:regina.brecht@us.army.mil">US Army Sustainment Command</a>
<DESC>The Government received several comments/concerns from industry regarding the consideration of including an Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) or similar type provision in the RFP (W52P1J-09-R-0093) for Non-Standard Ammunition (NSA) for the Government of Afghanistan and US Forces.  The Government does not consider an EPA during performance to be executable based on the funding requirements; however, we agreed to review alternative methods that will allow adjustments to unit prices due to fluctuations.  The Government has discussed alternate solutions while considering both industry's concerns and the constraints of the acquisition/requirements.  Below is an outline of the proposed price provision for possible incorporation into the solicitation:<BR><BR>The contract will be Fixed Price with prospective price redetermination, similar to the provisions in FAR 16.205.  The price redetermination will be based on the currency exchange only.  No other fluctuations will be considered when re-determining price.  The price redetermination will only apply to option prices exercised more than at least 12 months pat the initial award.  The redetermination will only be applied to the portion of the NSA item contract unit price attributable to direct purchased materials subject to foreign currency fluctuation, exclusive of transportation and indirect costs.  The offeror will be required to submit fixed prices for the base and all option periods at time of proposal submission.  The offeror will also be required to submit documentation (e.g. supplier quotes) which documents the portion of the proposed unit price that is direct purchased materials subject to foreign currency fluctuation.  Price redeterminations will be made at designated times during the life of the contract (no more than 2 times).  At time of redetermination, the Government will apply the current currency exchange rate, which will be based on an average of several foreign currency indices designated at time of award, to the portion of the proposed fixed unit price that is direct purchased materials subject to foreign currency fluctuation.  A ceiling price, in the form of a percentage of the current line item unit price or total contract price, will be applicable to upward adjustments; however, there will be no limitations on downward adjustments.  <BR><BR>Prior to incorporation into the solicitation, the Government would like industry feedback on whether the proposed provision would be beneficial and reduce some of the concerns and risks associated with FFP for the entire life of the contract.  Request you provide feedback on the potential price redetermination provision to Ms. Regina Brecht, regina.brecht@us.army.mil, by 1200 CDT, 17 June 2009.<BR>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W91YTZ09R0041.<br><br>QUESTIONS:<BR><BR>1.  Are there any incumbent personnel? <BR><BR>2.  Incumbent contractor award price? <BR><BR>3.  Is there a page limit for Part 2 (Technical)? <BR><BR>4.  What type of references can an offeror submit if they have no company past performance? Would former   employment experience managing contracts of the same scope be acceptable? <BR><BR>5.  In support of the contractor having personnel ready to back fill in the event of absences, vacation or any adverse action, will the government allow the contractor to have back up personnel complete MTF orientation and be issued CAC cards to prevent disruption in services? <BR><BR>6.  In the Instructions for Offerors- For Reps & Certs it notes that if reps & certs are currently at orca.bpn.gov, that the contractor should fill out Section K. However, in Section K it instructs the contracting officer to check K(1) or K(2) if it applies. What portion does the contractor need to fill out?<BR><BR>ANSWERS:<BR><BR>1.  No, there are no incumbent personnel.<BR> <BR>2.  There is no incumbent contractor award price, this is a new contract.<BR> <BR>3.  No, there is no page limit for Part 2 (Technical).  Of course, we prefer offeror to be as concise as possible, but at the same time, include all the pertinent information necessary.<BR> <BR>4.  Neutral Risk- will be assigned during evaluation for - no past performance history.<BR> <BR>5.  No, we cannot assign CAC cards or provide MTF training in advance.  The employee must be officially hired before we can proceed; the CAC card being a security issue.  The whole in-processing for new employees only takes approximately 3 days, so disruption of services is not a real concern.<BR><BR>6.  The referenced part of Reps and Certs (Section K) is not applicable to this acquisition.<BR><BR>

Box 7954 Cartagena de Indias D.T. y C., Colombia Tel (57-5) 660-7781 Fax (57-5) 660-9004 Ports of Cartagena and Contecar Central Security and Customs Facility Feasibility Study. The Grantee (Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Cartagena) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to develop a central customs and security facility that will serve the two ports. The objective of this feasibility study in Colombia is to develop a central customs and security facility that will serve the Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Cartagena&rsquo;s (SPRC) Ports of Cartagena and Contecar, which are located 15 kilometers apart. Over the past 13 years, SPRC&rsquo;s container traffic has multiplied seven-fold, and its facilities can handle over 1,000,000 TEUs and 600,000 tons of bulk cargo per year. SPRC succeeded in obtaining a U.S. Container Security Initiative (CSI) designation for the Port of Cartagena. The Feasibility Study would support the development of a central customs and security system to serve these two ports operated by SPRC, and possibly other terminals in the area. The project will supplement and expand container handling capacity at Cartagena and improve SPRC&rsquo;s competitive position. SPRC intends to extend Cartagena&rsquo;s Terminal Operating System to the Port of Contecar by connecting the terminal security of the two operations with technology such as fiber optic cabling and wireless transmitters. The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Feasibility Study include the following tasks: (1) review existing security and customs clearance systems, (2) identify and evaluate potential sites for the central security and customs facility, (3) interim presentation, (4) development and environmental impacts, (5) performance specifications and implementation plan, and (6) final report and presentation. The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $400,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

In the fax, please include your firm&rsquo;s name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore:  1) The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs to de-water the structures.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  3)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  Miter gates weighing up to 365 tons may require disconnection from anchorage and jacking for repair.  Miter gates may also require specialized alignment for positioning; removal and installation of contact blocks; stressing of steel diagonals; and line bores of up to 13 inch diameter for gudgeon and anchor pin replacement.  The amount of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.

<AWDNBR>FA4814-09-P-0159
<DESC><p>The 6th Contracting Squadron (6 CONS) at MacDill AFB intends to issue a sole source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Rockwell Collins for the relocation of a AN/PSC-11 Single Channel Anti-jam Manportable (SCAMP) satellite terminal using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to Citations 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) or as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Using this vendor is critical to the proper integration of the existing equipment and award to any other source would void the existing warranty on the equipment and result in substantial duplications of costs to the Government . The North American Industry Classification System is 561990 and the size standard is $7.0 Million. Revised Numbered Notes 22: "This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in proposal preparation. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The 6th Contracting Squadron will consider all proposals received by 3:00pm EST (Eastern Standard Time) 14 June 2009, three days after publication of this notice. All questions and comments should be addressed to Amn. Karla Torres who can be reached at (813) 828-1375 or karla.torres@macdill.af.mil. Note: If documents are sent via email, the contractor will be responsible for validating government receipt by calling Contract Specialist. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.</p>
