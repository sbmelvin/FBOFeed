<a href="mailto:mari.beckler@us.army.mil">MICC - White Sands Missile Range</a>
<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC), White Sands Missile Range, NM intends to procure, on a sole-source basis with SciTec, Inc., 100 Wall Street, Princeton, NJ 08540-1523 to provide ongoing support for the Joint Mobile Infrared Countermeasures Test System (JMITS) which was initially developed under Army contract W9124Q-04-C-0225 with a subsequent follow-on Army contract W9124Q-09-D-0800.  SciTec was the original developer of the JMITS system.  As a result of this development, SciTec possesses a unique knowledge of the design and operation of the JMITS system that no other known source possesses.  Major components within the JMITS system that are of unique SciTec design are the UV and infrared (IR) emitters, the jam beam laser radiometers, the down-range UV and IR radiometers and the data acquisition units.  Additionally, the real-time operating software that controls the JMITS system is of SciTec design.  The software represents on the order of 1 million lines of code to include embedded machine code; code developed using higher level languages and programming environments such as C++, MatLab and TENA.  Communication between the different hardware components and control computers is accomplished over a proprietary high speed serial communications link, standard ETHERNET and WiFi links.  Many of the non-real time code elements within the JMITS library contain unique algorithms and techniques needed to process and format the data that is shared among the JMITS components in the process of generating a missile warning system (MWS) signature and analyzing the data produced in a test run.  Re-engineering this code could result in unreliable JMITS performance, and could invalidate the system as an operational test (OT) resource.<br><br>Work to be performed on the JMITS system will include maintenance, repairs, upgrades, and producing duplicate systems/components that must maintain commonality, interoperability, configuration control, validation, and uniform methodologies, procedures and processes within the overall JMITS architecture.<br> <br>The following items represent SciTec unique capabilities that were a direct result of the JMITS development.<br><br>1.      Unique optical and electro-mechanical designs in UV and IR emitters.<br><br>2.      Proprietary emitter and radiometer operating/control firmware.<br><br>3.      Proprietary and specialized real-time operating and control software.<br><br>The following represents specialized knowledge critical to JMITS operations available from SciTec.<br><br>1.      UV and IR missile simulation development.<br><br>2.      UV and IR radiometry related to missile signatures.<br><br>3.      Jam laser radiometry and signal processing.<br><br>4.      Extensive MWS testing, missile signature collection and associated data processing and analysis.<br><br>5.      Missile flight and signature models; atmospheric and range corrections to missile signatures.<br><br>The JMITS currently represents a unique resource providing support that is critical to ongoing service and non-DoD aircraft survivability enhancement test programs.  The JMITS is specifically called out as a critical test resource in the Test and Master Plan (TEMP) for several programs and is slated for testing with many DoD programs.  Many of these programs have time sensitive, schedule driven events that require a very high reliability and availability rate from JMITS.  Accordingly, the government must have the capability for quick turn-around for maintenance support.  The government must also perform continuing upgrades and improvements to JMITS in order to respond to evolving system under tests (SUT) capabilities and test requirements.  <br><br>A hybrid cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) with firm fixed price (FFP) provisions award is anticipated.  The government intends to issue only this single notice under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a) (2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation will be forth coming. Comments must be directed towards Timothy A. Byrnes at timothy.a.byrnes@us.army.mil or by phone at 575-678-5413. Any comments must be received no later than 4:00 pm MDT on 8 July 2011. <br>    <br>

<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR), Pittsburgh, PA desires assistance concerning a mining related heat transfer problem. In the event of an underground coal mine disaster, mine workers are taught to attempt to escape or exit the mine to reach the surface/outside as quickly as possible. If a mine worker cannot facilitate self escape, they are instructed to proceed to the nearest mine refuge chamber. A mine refuge chamber is an enclosed structure that provides a breathable atmosphere, food, and water to provide 96 hours of life support for the number of occupants for which the chamber was intended. These chambers, which are currently portable and are moved forward as the mine face advances, are either a steel box or an inflatable tent-type structure. The tents are inflated after the mine disaster by the arriving miners. Refuge chamber capacities range from 12 to 36 occupants. Mine operators can choose chamber capacity based on the number of miners "reasonably expected" to use the refuge in the event a disaster occurs. Once inside the chamber, miners seal the door, activate the oxygen, assemble and activate the carbon dioxide scrubbing system, and then wait for rescue. The hope is that rescuers reach the chamber within the 96-hour life support window.<br />A NIOSH/OMSHR goal is to provide mine workers with the most survivable refuge alternatives by addressing technical barriers or knowledge gaps that are hindering miners' acceptance of refuge alternatives. The overarching objective of this research is to solve engineering problems or develop engineering guidelines associated with the occupation of a refuge alternative after a mine disaster, specifically the heat issues inside the refuge. The proposed work will be used to establish engineering specifications and practical guidelines for designing refuge alternatives and contending with heat and humidity inside an occupied refuge alternative. Through the use of modeling techniques such as Finite Element (FE) or Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) or other means as deemed appropriate:<br />&bull; Describe the heat-transfer mechanisms associated with refuge chamber occupation;<br />&bull; Determine the effect of refuge chamber wall materials on heat transfer out of the chamber;<br />&bull; Provide an analysis of what affects the heat transfer process more--the mine air temperature, or the temperature of the surrounding coal ribs, roof, and mine floor;<br />&bull; Analyze how increases in ambient mine air affect the heat transfer from inside the chamber to outside the chamber and the resulting interior temperatures;<br />&bull; Determine the effect that the direct contact of a refuge chamber with the mine floor has on heat transfer and the depth into the mine floor that the heat will transfer; and<br />&bull; Determine if the mine structure (roof, ribs, and floor) act as an infinite heat sink.<br />The CDC intends to award a single Firm-Fixed Price contract for this requirement.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), National Personal Protective TechnolotyLaboratory, (NPPTL) hereby announces its intent to issue a Purchase Order to Ocence, Inc. to procure Ocenco EBA 6.5 Self Contained, Sel-Rescuers (SCSR).<br />Purpose and Objective: to procure Ocenco EBA 6.5 Self Contained Self-Rescuers (SCSR) for testing and evaluating, in the NIOSH Long-Term Field Evaluation.<br />Project Background: In order to minimize the probability of SCSR failures and subsequent miner deaths, NIOSH and it predecessor have conducted a program entitled: the Long Term Field Evaluation Program (LTFE), This Program has been in place since the introduction of SCSRs (over 20 years). Each year, NIOSH collects deployed SCSRs from active mines across the country and replaces those devices with new units of the same model and manufacturer. The number of each type collected is determined by their portion of the total population of SCSRs in use. Replacing the collected SCSRs with units of the same kind is required/necessiary since each manufacturer's unit operates differently and miners at that mine must be trained on the specific device. Mixing of different models of SCSR at any mine would cause confusion amnd increase probability of death in an emergency. The collected SCSRs are taken to the National Personnel Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) when they are inspected and evaluated for their life support capacity. This program has identified many unexpected failures over the years of operation and have resulted in recalls of SCSRs and improved SCSR design. Miners' lives have been saved by units that would likely have failed if not upgraded due to the LTFE Program.<br />Responsible Sources that belive they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the itme description and pricing information to James Ambrozic, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2011-Q-99194. All Vendors must be registered in the Central Contractors Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is www.ccr.gov.<br />The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used soley for the purpose of determininig whether to conduct a competitive procurment.<br />If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.103-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Ocenco, Inc., 10225 82nd Street, Pleasant Prairie, WI 53158, as the only source ans a Purchase Order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.<br />

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), intends to award a sole source purchase order to AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, 607 14th Street, NW, Suite 201, Washington, D.C. 20005 for the acquisition of services to develop and measure the effectiveness of a parent class curriculum for parents of young novice drivers. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months.<br /><br />Until recently, not enough was known about what parents do, and what they need to do differently to effectively supervise their young novice drivers. The recently completed AAAFTS study provided a wealth of information about parents' strengths and weaknesses in supervising their young beginning drivers. Formal parent orientation sessions provide a venue for reaching parents with guidance for supervising their young drivers. As states and communities implement these sessions, it is important to have at least one proven effective curriculum available. The objective of this project is to evaluate the interactive parent orientation session, incorporating findings from the recently completed AAAFTS study, to improve parental supervision of young novice drivers.<br />&nbsp;
<p>AAAFTS recently completed a first-of-a-kind study, using in-vehicle cameras and multiple interviews over the course of a year, to thoroughly examine how parents supervise young beginning drivers (Goodwin et al. 2010). AAAFTS will use this study to develop and evaluate the parent curriculum.</p>
<p>AAAFTS is the sole owner of the results of the study, the observational information and the analysis of the data that will be used to develop the parent's curriculum. No other organization has coordinated or collected the observational data required to develop the planned parent's curriculum. Additionally, no other national organization has the influence, expertise, experience and level of acceptance and authority that the AAAFTS does with the traffic safety and driver education communities.</p>
<p>AAAFTS is the only organization that can provide the skills, expertise, and experience to meet all of the program requirements including cost and time constraints. No efforts to identify potential sources were taken because no other vendor is qualified to complete the development of the parent curriculum without substantial duplication of costs that would not be recovered through competition. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via E-MAIL ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2011-Q-13537 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN July 9, 2011. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The FAA has a requirement for fifty-five (55) Brushless Motor Modification Kits in support of the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR).  A market survey was posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities web site in April 2008.  The market survey stated that only those responses providing the required documentation in response to the market survey would be considered prior to further action by the FAA.  Four vendors were identified based on market research.
The FAA procured and tested equipment from the responding vendors.  The qualification/testing period was completed in the last quarter of 2010.  A Screening Information Request/Request for Offers (SIR/RFO) has been submitted to those firms that were determined qualified based on results of the testing.
A one-time Firm-Fixed-price type contract is contemplated.

<DESC>&nbsp;The Federal Emergency Management Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13) with Cable One, 620 Noble Street, Anniston, AL, as the only responsible source that can provide cable television and internet service to the Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP), Anniston, AL. Specifically, the contractor shall provide one year of standard cable service (9/1/2011 - 8/31/2012) to three CDP facilities (532 outlets total).
<p>Cable One is the current provider of cable television and (some) internet services to CDP. As such, they have an established infrastructure of cabling and outlets throughout the CDP facility, including cabling through inner walls, recessed ceilings, and in-ground conduits. The use of any other cable television or internet service provider would require the substantial duplication of cost for the replacement of the cabling infrastructure. In addition, Cable One is the only Government authorized cable service provider with a franchise for Anniston, AL. No other cable service provider is authorized by local ordinance.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures (IAW FAR 13). There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 517110 with a Small Business Size Standard of 1500 employees. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to James Suerdieck at james.suerdieck@dhs.gov. Statements are due by 1200 EST, 08 JUL 2011. No phone calls accepted.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis
<p>Proposals from all business concerns will be accepted for the Design-Build (D-B) of an interchange at SR 85 and West McWhorter Avenue at the Eglin Air Force Base (Eglin AFB) located in Okaloosa County, Florida, Solicitation Number: DTFH71-11-R-00001. The proposed interchange will replace a signalized intersection with an overpass interchange. Steel structures and AASHTO Girder structures will not be considered. The D-B contract for the project includes, but is not limited to, the design and construction of a bridge over SR 85 that meets the traffic requirements, ramps from SR 85 to the bridge, access across SR 85 for large very heavy equipment (75 ton plus tractor trailer) either on the bridge or on RR 215, access to nearby Forest Service facilities, temporary roads as needed to maintain access to Eglin AFB, storm water management (SWM) facilities (removal and relocation as needed), utility relocation coordination, and removal of the existing traffic signal. The work is anticipated to include, among other things, design, utility relocations, adjustments and coordination (as needed), water quality permit acquisition and obtaining of all required environmental permits as required for construction of this project, roadway and bridge construction, quality assurance and quality control for design and construction, temporary roadway pavements for access to the Eglin AFB, and overall project management.</p>
<p>Environmental Compliance (Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)) has been completed. The selected contractor will be responsible for all required permits for NPDES for the project.</p>
<p>The project is to occur completely on federal lands controlled by Eglin AFB. SR 85 is an easement through Eglin AFB, not Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) or FDOT property. The U.S. Air Force will be providing an easement to provide additional right-of-way, and this action does require a change in land use in the easement. The intent is to obtain a temporary right of entry during construction and to get a permanent easement once construction is complete. Gas, water, and electrical utilities all have active right of way in the area. Right of way easements would need to be<br />updated to reflect any changes in utility placements. Please note that any utilities will need to be relocated or avoided. The design and construction cost for award exceed $10,000,000. The project at this time is "Subject to Availability of Funding". It is intended that SR 85 will be widened to three lanes in each direction in the future. This project should be designed in such a manner that significant reconstruction will not be needed for this future project.</p>
<p>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 36.3 - Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, the Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division (EFLHD) of the FHWA is conducting a "two phased" D-B selection process for Eglin AFB and FDOT. The project will be split into two bid options; either Schedule A OR Schedule B will be awarded based on the availability of funding. If Schedule A is awarded, all work on the project needs to be completed by the end of August of 2013. If Schedule B is awarded, all work on the project needs to be completed by the end of September of 2013. Solicitation documents for Phase One, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), should be issued on or about October 12, 2010. Qualifications due date and location will be specified on the SF 1442 of the solicitation documents. An evaluation board will review and evaluate contractor qualifications and select the three most highly qualified D-B firms/teams to participate in Phase Two of this D-B selection process. Selection will be based on the established RFQ evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>During Phase Two, those firms/teams short-listed will be sent a Request for Proposal (RFP), which will outline the remainder of the process requirements including submission of technical and cost proposals and be invited to give a presentation. The Phase Two RFP is anticipated to be issued in January 2011 with contract award anticipated in April, 2011. A site visit will be scheduled during the RFP phase.</p>
<p>Please send all questions concerning this D-B project to eflhd.contracts@dot.gov. Include the solicitation number, project name and number, requesting firm and address, a point of contact and telephone number. Requests for 'faxing' or overnight mailing will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Use Internet address https://www.fbo.gov/ (at QUICK SEARCH, type "EFLHD" and all available projects will be listed) to check for availability of bid documents. All bid documents can be directly downloaded from this website. Documents will no longer be mailed. Register to receive Email Notification to automatically be notified when a document is added or updated for a specific project.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), anticipates a requirement for a General Contractor (GC) for the renovation of Building 1 (B1R) exteriors project on NIST's campus in Boulder, Colorado. The NAICS code for the proposed acquisition is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the Small Business size standard is $33.5 million. The solicitation is planned to be released on or about August 1, 2011 with an award anticipated for September of 2011. The estimated price range of this project is $5,000,000.00 to $9,000,000.00. The performance period for this project is estimated at five hundred forty days (540) calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed.
<p>The proposed NIST B1R exteriors project is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. This procurement requires General Construction (GC) services for the renovation of the NIST Boulder Building 1 (B1R) exteriors project. The GC shall construct all exterior service corridors, excavation, utilities, foundations, and roofing for the B1R exteriors project. The construction will include phasing for the continuation of utility services and minimal disruption to ongoing scientific research throughout Building 1.</p>
<p>This exteriors project must be completed in the five hundred and forty calendar days in order to dovetail with future interior and exterior projects for Building 1 and the surrounding campus of NIST. It is anticipated that this project will result in construction of exterior utility chases or structures to support future renovation to Building 1. It is anticipated that some occupants of Building 1 will be relocating to the new Precision Measurement Laboratory that is currently under construction as early as spring of 2012. This coordination effort will be scheduled with NIST as to not disrupt ongoing scientific research. The exterior project will support stringent requirements for temperature, humidity, vibration control and air filtration required in future renovation projects for Building 1. The B1R exterior project shall be constructed to obtain LEED Silver certification at a minimum and utilize Labs 21 Best Practices Guides.</p>
<p>All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered at the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier. A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet at 800-333-0505 or on line at <br />https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html.</p>
<p><br />A pre-proposal conference will be scheduled at the NIST Boulder Campus, located at 325 Broadway in Boulder, Colorado. Information regarding the conference will be contained in the solicitation posting. One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.</p>
<p>The government will not pay for any information solicited. Offers that do not meet all the requirements or are not submitted within the allotted time will not be considered.</p>
<p>This procurement is a small business set aside. The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 236220, and the corresponding size standard for determining whether or not a firm qualifies as a small business is $33.5 million in average, annual receipts (gross) over the past three years. Although this procurement is set aside for small business, small firms (including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-Owned small firms, and service disabled Veteran-Owned business) are strongly encouraged to participate in the construction and renovation of federal facilities. ALL firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local (Denver/Boulder area) business concern participation. Please refer to the SBA website for additional details at www.sba.gov.</p>

<DESC>The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC), has a requirement for commercial supply vessel charter off the coast of California in the Southern California Bight for Highly Migratory Species in that area.
<p>NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) is planning a research survey in the Southern California Bight (SCB) for highly migratory species including pelagic sharks, swordfish, and albacore during the summer of 2011. The overall goals of the survey are: 1) to conduct a fishery-independent longline survey for juvenile mako and blue sharks continuing a 15 year abundance time series; 2) to conduct longline fishing for swordfish to deploy archival tags and collect biological samples to examine age and maturity, feeding habits, and the potential for stock heterogeneity of swordfish entering the U.S. West Coast fisheries; 3) to conduct trolling for albacore for the deployment of archival tags and to collect biological samples to examine age and maturity, feeding habits, and the potential for stock heterogeneity of North Pacific albacore entering the U.S. West Coast fisheries; and 4) to collect oceanographic data to examine environmental effects on the distribution and catch rates of sharks, swordfish, and albacore. The survey is being conducted to support research and data needs identified by NMFS and affiliated scientific organizations and committees including the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), the International Scientific Committee for Tunas and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific (ISC), and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). Conducting swordfish and albacore sampling will also help address some of the objectives of the Swordfish Leatherback Use of Temperate Habitat (SLUTH) Initiative and the SWFSC/Albacore Industry Cooperative Research program and provide a better examination of the large pelagic fish component of the SCB ecosystem.</p>
<p>Longline survey for juvenile mako and blue sharks:<br />The SCB is a nursery ground for neonate and juvenile shortfin mako and blue sharks. From 1988 through 1991, there was an experimental pelagic longline fishery for these sharks, but due to concern over the high catch of juveniles and the lack of a market for blue sharks, the fishery was discontinued. This abundance survey was initiated to monitor trends in catch rates of juvenile mako and blue sharks. Seven California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) defined fishing blocks (each 10 x 10 minutes; see Figure 1) were selected as survey locations based on their consistently high catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and low variability during the months of June through August for the experimental fishery. Gear used for the survey is the same as was used to target sharks during the fishery. During the past 17 years (1994 through 2010 with the exception of 1998 and 1999) fifteen surveys have been conducted within the focal areas. The data are to be used in support of stock assessments for mako and blue sharks, the two species caught in the greatest numbers during the survey. The survey also provides the opportunity to conduct tagging and studies of age and growth, reproductive status, and other aspects of the life history of these vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Swordfish longlining: <br />Commercial swordfish fisheries are the second most important fisheries for HMS off the U.S. West Coast. Swordfish longlining during the HMS research cruise will be conducted to: 1) collect additional information on swordfish essential habitat; and 2) examine stock structure off California. To achieve both objectives swordfish will be targeted at night in areas identified by sea surface temperature (SST) and frontal features in the SCB. Archival tags, which typically provide longer data records than can be obtained using pop-up satellite tags that are limited to ~9 months or less, will be deployed to examine swordfish fine-scale movements. Concurrent oceanographic measurements will be made to characterize swordfish habitat. The additional information on swordfish essential habitat will improve efforts to differentiate swordfish and leatherback turtle habitat. Long term records from archival tags will also provide information on swordfish stock structure. The area of the U.S. West Coast is thought to be one of mixing between fish originating from Hawaii and Mexico. Observations on parasite loads, skin morphology, and the presence of cookie cutter shark bites from all live individuals will help address this question. In addition, samples from swordfish that do not survive capture will be used to examine feeding habits, maturity, age and growth, and their physiological low oxygen threshold, which will provide insight into potential limits to vertical movements due to hypoxia.</p>
<p>Albacore trolling:<br />The U.S. North Pacific albacore surface fishery is one of the few remaining open access fisheries for HMS on the west coast. The North Pacific-wide stock is managed by the PFMC, IATTC, and Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC). The last stock assessment conducted by the ISC concluded that current fishing effort may be above long term sustainable levels. The PFMC is considering potential regulatory measures, but there remain uncertainties about the age and growth model and albacore stock structure assumptions used in the assessment that may affect biomass and fishing mortality estimates. The SWFSC has been actively studying albacore in cooperation with both the west coast recreational and commercial fleets; however, access to whole fish for tagging and biological sampling early in the season when fish return to the SCB is limited and has been identified as a priority. Based on logs of the commercial passenger fishing fleet in southern California from 1981 through 2007, areas with high catch rates in June and July have been identified for targeting albacore (see Figure 2). Albacore will be targeted using several different fishing methods including rod and reel, handline, and troll, supplemented by chumming with live bait. Subsamples of fish will be provided for use by other scientists of the ISC Albacore Working Group (ALBWG) as identified under the ALBWG research priorities as well as within the SWFSC for age and growth, feeding habits, otolith microchemistry, and genetics studies.</p>
<p>Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, transportation and services necessary to provide a vessel charter in the Southern California Bight as noted in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>The resulting firm-fixed-price (with reimbursement of fuel at cost) contract will have a base period of performance from approximately June 15, 2011 through June 14, 2012, with one (1) option period, consecutively occurring after the base period.<br /><br />The proposed contract is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The NAICS code for this procurement is 483113 and the size standard is 500 employees. All responsible and fully responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. Any resulting contract will be awarded as a firm-fixed price IDIQ contract with delivery orders issued. Solicitation documents will be made available for download on or about April 22, 2011 at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Paper copies of this solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Water Resources Discipline, California Water Science Center, has a requirement to purchase a resistivity meter to measure the electrical resistivity of the earth.  This capability is necessary to measure the lateral spreading of recharged water.  The electrical resistivity of the subsurface is driven by the water content of sedimentary deposits and changes in resistivity through repeat measurements at the same time location are a proxy for the movement of water applied to recharge ponds through the subsurface.Advanced Geosciences, Inc. (AGI), Austin, TX, is to the USGS's knowledge the only interested and qualified contractor because it is the only known commercially available resistivity meter with 8 real time channels with 20 bit resolution each, has the highest signal resolution, it can conduct many different array types with an unlimited number of electrodes and conduct roll along surveys to provide limitless survey.Therefore, the government intends to award this requirement non-competitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) (1) to Advanced Geosciences, Inc.Other interested concerns having the ability to meet the USGS requirement may submit a capabilities statement to the Contract Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 1500 local time.  All submission will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  If no competitive opportunities exist, solicitation G11PS00598 will be made available to Advanced Geosciences, Inc. on or about  29 June 2011.This notice and any resulting solicitation or purchase order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-52, effective 31 May 2011.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to solicit for a single-award IDIQ contract to update the Tri-Service Automated Cost Engineering Systems (TRACES) Cost Book and Area Cost Factors databases. The TRACES Cost Book currently has approximately 69,000 task items and is updated every two years and the Area Cost Factors are updated every year. Area Cost Factors (both CONUS and OCONUS) are used by the Department of Defense for calculating the cost of general construction at a specific military installation as compared to a "National Average". The database will support several DOD automated information systems. These services will be acquired using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541513 (Computer Facilities Management Services). The IDIQ contract will have a capacity not-to-exceed $5.6 Million over a one-year base and 3 one-year option periods. Since these services are commercial, the simplified acquisition procures of FAR 13.5 will be used for solicitation and award. The successful contractor shall provide a commercial off-the-shelf, readily available cost book in electronic format which is maintained and updated on a regular basis. The Cost Book must be an item that is readily available for purchase by the general public and includes material cost, labor items, equipment items, crew makeup and productivity. This item may be somewhat customized at the user's request. This level of customization for the customer is considered standard within the cost book industry. Additionally, the contractor will perform market research to provide additional cost information, such as material prices on government maintained tasks, as requested.  In addition, this Cost Book Support contract includes provisions for updating the Area Cost Factors.  A yearly survey is performed to update the database used by the Area Cost Factors software application. The following items may also be required by the contractor as a part of this acquisition: telephone hotline support, other economic surveys, electronic database distribution, technical documentation preparation, database management, other commercially available data such as, but not limited to, assembly and square foot cost data, life cycle cost data, etc. The solicitation document will be available on fbo.gov on/about 8 July 2011. <br><br>

<DESC>This announcement is for Sources Sought; those parties interested, please send us your capabilities concerning the announcement below: <br />The intent is to notify potential contractors of the upcoming Utilities service acquisition (NAICS code 221122 and size standard 4 million megawatt hours). The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, tools, equipment, and supervision necessary to supply and deliver uninterrupted electrical power and demand to meet the Government's needs at F. E. Warren Air Force Base, WY. Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) provides a portion of the power requirements for the base and the contractor will provide over and above WAPA. The approximate requirement is 6 MW of demand and 24,000,000 kWh/year energy. The control will include scheduling and firming up 3.4 MW of wind power owned by the Government. Multiple generation sources for the power are preferred. Some of the power may be redistributed to the privatized military family housing on base and reimbursed. A percentage of green power should be available for the Government's use. Load profiles will be included in the solicitation package. The contractor must be able to enter WAPA's grid at any point acceptable to WAPA. Power is delivered to the base through the Government's 20 MW substation that is attached to WAPA's grid, at 115 KV primary to a 13.8 KV base distribution system. The period of performance for the resultant utilities service contract is ten (10) years. For contract pricing structure, use of an energy price index, rather than firm-fixed pricing, is being considered. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government at this time. In order to assess set-aside possibilities, interested parties are invited to respond by submitting a letter identifying your business as: 1) small business (SB), 2) 8(a) contractor, 3) small disadvantaged business (SDB), 4) HUBZone small business, 5) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), or 6) woman-owned small business (WOSB) under NAICS code 221122 with a size standard of 4 million megawatt hours. The solicitation will be available only via the Internet at the following address: https://www.fbo.gov (FedBizOpps). Questions should be addressed to Mr. Ryan Oberholtzer at 307-773-6649. Note: Contractor must be actively registered with Central Contractor Registration to be eligible for contract award or payment from the DoD activity.

<DESC><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation)</strong>
<p>The United States Air Force, ASC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking potential sources that are capable of providing a new near-field and confocal microspectrophic instruments suite. Firms responding shall specify that their equipment meets the specifications provided below and provide detailed product information to show clear technical compliance. Additionally, sales history including recent commercial companies sold to should be included to determine commerciality.</p>
<p><strong>The following is a list of for a near field and confocal microspectroscopic instrument suite. In order to meet requirements of anticipated experimental evaluations it must be a single, integrated system with the ability to:<br /><br /></strong>1. Operate in confocal microscopy, Raman microscopy, and near-field optical scanning microscopy (NSOM) modes of operation while also collecting topographic images, and to perform simultaneous confocal and near field measurements and register data.<br /><br />2. Operate multiple near-field optical probes (two, three, or four) and control all of the probes independently in three dimensions (and independent of the sample position).<br /><br />3. The system must be supplied with two laser sources at 532nm and 633nm and the ability to add additional external or internal sources for Raman, fluorescence or other spectroscopic characterization over a wavelength range of 450nm to 1.5um.<br /><br />4. Independently control the sample position in three dimensions relative to the near-field optical probe position. This movement should be accomplished in a "fine" (high resolution) mode at least 10 microns in the z-direction to accommodate thick samples without going to "coarse" movement and back to "fine."<br /><br />5. Perform Raman spectroscopy in both near-field optical scanning and confocal modes with an integrated spectrometer utilizing a scientific grade, large pixel, cooled detector array.<br /><br />6. Use both straight and bent/cantilevered probes depending on the sample being studied and whether experiments use a single probe or multiple probes to allow for simultaneous optical imaging and a maximum flexibility to address samples with optical stimuli.<br /><br />7. Use a wide range of probes capable of coated-aperture-NSOM, uncoated-aperture-NSOM, apertureless-NSOM, micropipetting, and electrical resistive/thermoelectric testing.<br /><br />8. Be compatible with external ultrafast laser source in confocal and NSOM modes of operation. The external source would be brought into the system through provided optical routing structures for use in microscopy modes.<br /><br />9. Remove the upper microscope assembly to allow for free space illumination from the top of the sample with an external ultrafast or other laser source.<br /><br />10. Use an external ultrafast or other laser source through a microscope objective as well as through free space with a usable angle of incidence from normal incidence to at least 70 degrees relative to the normal of the sample.<br /><br />11. The microscope system must be able to operate in the following modes at a minimum:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Illuminate the sample (with internal or external source) through a probe and collect the reflected or transmitted light (excitation NSOM or Raman) with a microscope above and below the sample/probe plane.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Illuminate the sample from above (with internal or external source) and collect light through a probe (collection NSOM or Raman). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Illuminate the sample through a probe and collect light through a second probe.<br /><br />12. A flexible probe supply contract is required to guarantee system maintainability.<br /><br />All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capabilities to produce the requested equipment to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. <br /><br />Firms responding should indicate whether they are, or are not, a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, or a woman owned business. The general definition of a small business is one that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of operation in which it is proposing on Air Force contracts and with its affiliates; and the number of employees does not exceed 500. NAICS Code to be used for this acquisition is 334516. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent acquisition. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.<br /><br />Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.). <br /><br />Capabilities package: All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates company capabilities-indicating examples of commercial sales-and product specifications related to this effort. Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: Jennifer.Begg@wpafb.af.mil in a Microsoft word compatible format or mailed to ASC/PKOAA POC: Jennifer Begg, 1940 Allbrook Dr., Rm 109, Wright-Patterson AFB, Oh 45433-5309 to be received no later than 9:00 AM Eastern Standard Time, 08 July 2011.

<DESC>This request is an announcement for information/market research for planning purposes. The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, invitation for bid, nor does its issuance in any way obligate the Government or restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.<br />This synopsis is to notify interested contractors that the Government intends to procure the following Hardness Critical Item (HCI) diode. Potential contractors should have in-depth knowledge of the requirements of testing semiconductor devices for HCI applications involving neutron and gamma radiation testing. The end application is the ICBM Minuteman III weapon system. The work involves meeting the requirements cited in a Selected Item Drawing (SID) which the government owns and which specifies initial part supply, testing/acceptance criteria, and part remarking requirements. Drawings and tech data are available upon request by interested parties. Contractors who believe they are a qualified source to meet the SID for an HCI Diode should contact the Government official listed in this synopsis. Responders may be asked for information regarding their qualifications, standards certifications, prior experience on related work, and neutron/gamma testing facilities.<br />NSN: 5961-00-999-0490<br />Part Number: 89108822-01<br />Noun: Semiconductor Device<br />System: LGM-30G<br />Estimated Quantity: 150
<p>Following are some details on the Selected Item Drawing requirements:<br />The procurement would be for an HCI diode, but the final delivered items must meet the requirements of the SID (89108822-01). The SID details what parts the Contractor must begin with, how to test those parts to verify Hardness, documentation requirements, and requirements to re-label the original parts with serial numbers and the Government's part number (89108822-01).<br />The original/starting parts are specified as one of several JANTXV type diodes (JANTXV1N3600, JANTXV1N4150, JANTXV1N4150-1), which must be procured by the Contractor from the Qualified Suppliers listed by DLA in QPL-19500 and must meet wafer lot or date code lot requirements. When the Contractor has acquired the initial parts, the Selected Item testing will determine if those parts will meet the Government requirements. Traceability requirements must be met throughout. Parameter Drift Screening (PDS) is required both pre- and post-burn-in on all parts. Random sampling will be conducted to choose parts for Radiation Effects Testing (RET) with sampling criteria dependent on whether wafer lot or date code lot parts are available. RET consists of gamma and neutron testing as specified in the SID and associated Engineering Change Order (ECO) documentation. Reporting of test results shall be certified by Government Engineering and HCI personnel to pass inspection. Once parts have passed acceptance tests, the Contractor will be requried to re-mark the initial parts with the Government part number (89108822-01), serial number determined by Contractor, etc. as specified in the SID.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT, A MARKET SURVEY FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.   NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  No telephone calls will be accepted as there is no bid package or solicitation. In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made.  
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 333415 with a Small Business Size Standard of 750 Employees.
 The Government may use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement to make appropriate acquisition decisions. 
Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast (NAVFAC SE) is conducting market research and allowing for maximum industry participation to determine availability of United States based manufacturers/suppliers that exist for air-cooled, variable speed, centrifugal compressor type, liquid (water) chillers, which use the new magnetic bearing drive technology in the 70 to 150 tons refrigeration capacity range.  
On 11 May, 2011, the Secretary of the Navy announced that all Navy Military Construction (MILCON) projects will be designed and constructed to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold standards.
  To the maximum extent possible, additional certification points to achieve higher standards shall come from increasing energy and water efficiency and by using facility elements that reduce life cycle cost.  Additionally, US Navy facilities are required to be designed and constructed to use 30% less energy than the baseline, code-minimum building as prescribed by ASHRAE Std 90.1, Appendix G  Performance Rating Method (2007 ed.).  
The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, Port Hueneme, CA, has previously evaluated the magnetic bearing drive chiller and determined that this type of equipment will provide 35% energy savings over competing chiller technologies.  In active magnetic bearing systems, non-contact position sensors continually monitor shaft position and feed this information to a control system.
   The shaft position control system adjusts the current flowing to the shaft levitation actuators, which convert the current to magnetic forces by the actuator acting on the rotor to adjust position and provide damping.  
The additional benefits of magnetic bearings include:  no friction, no lubrication requirements, no oil contamination, much lower energy consumption (full load and part load), capacity to operate within a wide temperature range, superior service life (>20 years), and associated life cycle cost savings.  
Information to be submitted but not limited to:
(1)	Name and brief description of company, to include, business size, CAGE Code, DUNS number
(2)	Salient characteristics, technical data, specifications, warranty data of proposed product.
(3)	Place (country) of manufacturer, product name and model number
All information submitted will be reviewed and analyzed by US Government personnel and will be considered proprietary and confidential with respect to other responders and to future contract actions.
 However, it should be noted that information gathered through Sources Sought may significantly influence how the Department of Navy (DON) formulates acquisition planning.
Responses must be complete and sufficiently detailed to address the specific information DON is seeking.  Submissions must be on 8 by 11-inch standard paper, single spaced, 12 point font minimum and limited to ten pages.  Interested parties shall submit two (2) hard copies and one (1) CD. Packages shall be sent by mail to the following address: Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, ACQ-UT, Attention: Camilla Funk, P.O. Box 30, Bldg 903, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, FL , 32212-0030. Submissions must be received at the above office not later than 22 July 2011 at 3:00 pm EST.
   Hand-carried and electronic responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research which will be used to formulate an acquisition strategy to support the Force Protection Integration Division.  The Regional Contracting Office-National Capital Region (RCO-NCR) is requesting responses from all concerns.  The qualifying code for this effort is NAICS 541611. 

The United States Marine Corps (USMC) IED/MARCENT (Marine Forces Central Command) has a requirement for a Logistics Coordination Liaison to facilitate logistic movements of USMC Improvised Explosive Detector (IED) and Military Working Dog (MWD) Teams through Ramstein Air Base (AB) Germany. There is an immediate need for a support at the facility to coordinate the movement, bed down, and medical attention of Improvised Explosive Device Detector Dog (IDD) and other MWD assets.
  The effort will provide immediate support to Marine Dog Handlers and teams transitioning through Germany, augmenting existing entities aboard Ramstein AB.  The effort will also provide other coordination and staffing with supported and adjacent Combatant Command (COCOM) headquarters to ensure USMC compliance with COCOM logistics directives.

The IED Dogs enhance a commanders ability to protect the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) and assets more effectively.  Since 9/11, the demand for IDDs has increased to provide detection support to installations and forward operating forces. This has resulted in the traditional IDD program to expand and broaden its detection capabilities.  The USMC also has an initiative which was generated from a validated urgent need statement to provide a Detection Dog that is capable of tracking missing friendly personnel or enemy combatants such as IED makers and planters.
  

Objectives for the requirement include: (1) Update and refine Liaison Officer (LNO) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) through research and coordination with adjacent commands while providing SOP quarterly updates to Deputy Commandant, Combat Development and Integration, Capabilities Development Directorate (CDD), Force Protection Integration Division (FPID) and MARCENT. (2) Provide LNO and logistics services to support travel and layover requirements for USMC military working dogs.  Unique layover requirements exist for the transportation and layover of animals.  Logistics support will include housing, care and feeding of IDDs and military working dogs and their handlers, and necessitates personal on-site coordination by trained personnel.
  Traveling to pre-determined hubs for temporary actions to facilitate these flights is expected. (3) Provide Program Management Support in order to coordinate task activities and to provide management oversight for the effort to include providing appropriate support in order to conduct and facilitate task completion, coordination with supported and adjacent COCOM staffs as required, and staffing.

Responses to this RFI shall not exceed ten (10) pages, including cover letter and contact information.  Subject response must contain:  (1) Identification of business size; (2) Capability statement that includes capabilities and experience related to the objectives and competencies identified above, corporate or individual personnel experience is acceptable; (3) Approach to managing the execution of this contract, to include ability to support overseas operations; (4) other material relevant to establishing core competencies of the firm.

Response is due by 3:00 PM EST on Friday, 1 July 2011.
  Please submit e-mail responses to Wanda Wichmann at e-mail address: Wanda.Wichmann@usmc.mil.

NOTE:  Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these services; issue a solicitation; nor notify respondents of the results of this RFI.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.  The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this RFI and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.

<DESC>Description: The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia seeks sources and information for a new Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Man Portable Video Down-Link (MPVDL) system.  Existing Video Scout systems currently provide this capability but are too heavy to use while conducting dismounted patrols.  There is a potential requirement to rapidly acquire and field a man-portable system with Video Scout-like capabilities for use in conducting dismounted patrols in Afghanistan.

Concept of Employment: The Forward Air Controller (FAC) and Joint Terminal Area Controller (JTAC) and other foot mobile units require a ruggedized mobile man-portable video down-link that is portable, lightweight, durable and sustainable (in terms of batteries or power supply).
  The MPVDL shall be employed by maneuver unit foot mobile teams.  These teams will view real time, full motion video and associated metadata from attack aircraft targeting pods and other airborne Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, such as Scan Eagle, Shadow, Wasp, Raven B DDL, Predator, Reaper and Global Hawk.  Marines will be able to efficiently employ the MPVDL during foot mobile operations.  

The FAC/JTAC will use the video and associated metadata feeds for several purposes:

	To verify and confirm the correct target to attack and mitigate the risk of fratricide during close air support missions.
	To provide the FAC/JTAC with the aircrafts perspective on the situation.
	To develop target identification/location provided by airborne ISR platforms for attack by any fire support agency.
	To increase ground unit situational awareness.
	To store and share video for future exploitation in the deliberate or hasty planning process.
Desired key system attributes include:
	Must be capable of receiving and displaying Ku band, analog S band, and digital and analog C and L bands.
	Total system weight of 3 pounds or less.
	Video display viewable at night or in direct sun light.
  Night settings must be adjustable in order to maintain light discipline.
	Capable of displaying video on an external monitor.  This permits use in a static position such as a COC.
	Battery life capable of displaying 2 hours of video.
	Sustainable with conventional batteries or batteries already in use with other deployed systems.
Marines that are less mobile and/or operating from hard standing locations (combat outposts, combat operations centers) will use legacy, Video Scout systems for the same purposes.

Air Officers and/or Air Shops that normally operate from the Combat Operations Center (COC), in most often a monitoring and administrative role will employ Video Scout systems where weight and size concerns are not as prevalent.

Commercial firms possessing a system with the characteristics described in the concept of employment are encouraged to submit product brochures, product descriptions, specifications, statement of capabilities, and unit pricing data.
  Please notate if the product is offered on the GSA schedule.  Submissions should also address the topics of information assurance, encryption, technology readiness, existing product capabilities, and production capability.  Due to the requirement to rapidly field this capability, submission of information for systems that require development are not desired.  Limit responses to 20 pages (one sided) 12 point font.   Responses will be reviewed to identify firms potentially capable of fulfilling the Governments requirements.  This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for the information requested.
  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort.  If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  Responses to this RFI shall be mailed to Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn Lee Hoyland, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134-6050 on or before 17 August 2011.  Electronic files 1MB or smaller may be e-mailed. Point of Contact: Lee Hoyland, Contracting Officer, Phone (703) 432-3164, lee.hoyland@usmc.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.  The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting a market survey to obtain information on responsible sources that have the capability to provide Mobile Corrosion Rehabilitation Services (MCRF) support services, and if those support services are available via a General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract.  MARCORSYSCOM has a potential requirement for MCRF support services and believes that there are large and small businesses that have the capability to provide these support services.  MCRF support services will be performed on Marine Corps ground tactical  and support equipment designed to extend the useful service life of these assets to include reducing maintenance requirements due to corrosion damage that cannot be performed at the operator level.
 Mobile Corrosion repair services include, but are not limited to; (1) Cleaning; (2) Surface Preparation; (3) Minor Body Repair; (4) Painting, Registration Marking, and Undercoating; (5) Rust Inhibitor Application; (6) Compliance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), State and Local laws and regulations and Marine Corps policies and procedures; (7) Corrosion Assessments to identify the Corrosion Category of assets upon receipt and following completion of MCRF services; and (8) MCRF Program Management activities. A primary intent of this work is to restore the appearance of the equipment to a new coating condition and apply corrosion / abrasion resistant undercoatings or bedliners to selected vehicle areas.
  As a field level application, the intent is to mitigate  corrosion of the equipment, with minimal disassembly, via surface preparation and reapplication of the approved Chemical Agent Resistent Coating (CARC) system.   This work is expected to be carried out as a mobile team.  The team is expected to mobilize to / from various sites to provide the requested services.  At each site the contractor is expected to have the capability to erect temporary shelters to perform the work required and protect the equipment from exposure to inclement weather during the corrosion repair process. The MCRF is not intended to replace the capabilities of a fixed facility but instead perform MCRF services as an overflow on identified equipment to allow more major repair at Marine Corps fixed facilities.
  The support services shall be performed primarily at the following Marine Corps Installations: I MEF, II MEF, III MEF Hawaii, and Marine Force Reserve locations within Continental United States (CONUS).  The U.S. Marine Corps will use the results of this announcement to determine what capabilities exist in the marketplace.  MARCORSYSCOM will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of the request for information.  Interested firms are requested to submit a response in a Microsoft Office compatible format, not to exceed 10 pages, outlining their ability to meet or exceed the requirements identified above by no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, 15 July  2011.
  Firms should also include their business size/type, and management plan, if applicable.  Only electronic submissions will be accepted.  Interested sources shall send responses via e-mail to andrias.woody@usmc.mil.  DO NOT CALL MR. WOODY.  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY SERVICES/ITEMS.

<DESC>Notice Type: <br />Notice of Intent - Sole Source
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Engineering Laboratory, intends to negotiate with The National Institute of Building Sciences; Washington, DC, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to obtain the services described below.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> <br />The NIST Engineering Laboratory (EL) restarted its Earthquake Risk Reduction in Buildings R&amp;D Program in 2007 and has steadily built its capabilities since that time. The capabilities include both an in-house research group and an extramural research program. During this four-year period, the Earthquake Risk Reduction in Buildings R&amp;D Program has undertaken a number of research projects that had been previously identified through work performed by NIST's partners in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and are consistent with the Applied Technology Council's ATC-57 activities outline. There is now a need to develop a detailed Measurement Science roadmap for this Earthquake Risk Reduction in Buildings and Infrastructure Program. Market research shows that the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) is the only organization that can provide the services required by NIST. Public Law 93-383 has been incorporated into 12 USC Sec. 1701. Sec. 1701j-2, states that "Every department, agency, and establishment of the Federal Government having responsibility for building or construction, or for building or construction-related programs, is authorized and encouraged to contract with and accept contracts from the Institute where deemed appropriate by the responsible Federal official involved".</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 541712. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to NIBS for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST to provide the journals necessary may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before July 5, 2011 at 12 pm EST. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov.</p>

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Purchase Order for Tribal ecoAmbassadors
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:rodgers.jami@epa.gov">rodgers.jami@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of International and Tribal Affairs (OITA) American Indian Environmental Office (AIEO), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) of Alexandria, Virginia.
Under this order, AIHEC will assist EPA in the development of a Tribal ecoAmbassadors Program that will collaborate initially with professors at Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) to implement research to address a particular environmental or public health challenge in the community or on the reservation.  This pilot project will address specific analysis of environmental issues, which may include climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, air quality, water quality, and waste management.  
Under this order, AIHEC will be tasked with program management of the application process, the development of instructional webinars for selected Tribal ecoAmbassadors, and meeting support for up to four briefings on the research, results, and proposed solutions to the chosen topics. This will include support of a video conference at a future EPA Tribal Science Council meeting. 
The estimated period of performance is from July 2011 through June 2012.
The justification is as follows.  Market research indicates that this program is the first of its kind, connecting EPA directly to the TCUs in an exchange of invaluable environmental knowledge. To have a fully successful pilot year, this program needs to reach as many TCU academic institutions as possible.  AIHEC is a 501(c)(3) organization governed by a board of directors, which is comprised of the presidents of its accredited U.S.-based TCUs. By automatically providing access to every TCU, EPA estimates a wide variety of types of program proposals (climate change adaptation, water quality monitoring, etc.). AIHEC is uniquely qualified to satisfy this requirement given its members represent all TCUs.  EPA is not aware of any other tribal entity with this network of access to the targeted higher education institutions.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within ten days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the Contracting Officer via the e-mail link below.

<DESC>Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) Emergency Egress Window

Industry Day Notice


The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Quantico, VA, and the Program Executive Office, Land Systems (PEO LS) Program Manager Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement/ Logistic Vehicle System Replacement (PM MTVR/LVSR), Quantico, VA, will host an Industry Day on July 6th at the Transportation Demonstration Support Area (TDSA), Quantico, VA to provide prospective contractors for the Emergency Egress Window (EEW) time to view the MTVR cab window area on both reducible and non-reducible height armored vehicles.

Industry will be provided an opportunity to ask questions about the window area. The intent of the Industry Day is to provide advance information about the EEW requirement to Industry.

The United States Marine Corps (USMC) MTVR vehicles has a requirement for the EEW to provide alternative egress from the MTVR in the event that normal egress routes were no longer usable.

The overall goal is to provide an EEW that will allow the Marine emergency egress when the situation dictates.
 The desired windows should: 1) sustain the same level of ballistic protection as the current window; 2) integrate around current Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) located inside the cab; and 3) retain the means of egress when in a rollover situation.  More information regarding the requirements will be available at the Industry Day.

This Industry Day announcement is for planning purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for any information solicited.  Further, the Marine Corps Systems Command is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.
  When the solicitation is released, it will be released on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential Offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

Location:
Transportation Demonstration Support Area
Quantico VA, 22134

Security Base Access
    - Military and DOD personnel show DOD identification.
    - Civilians show driver's license, vehicle registration & proof of insurance. 
 
Security classification: Unclassified

Attendance to this Industry Day is recommended for all vendors interested in the EEW. Due to space limitations, interested parties are requested to limit attendance to no more than three (3) people.
  Vendors will be given a 90 minute time slot to look over the vehicles in order to become acclimated with the window dimensions in order to better understand the requirement.  A technical representative as well as a contracts representative will be on hand at TDSA to answer questions regarding the EEW.

The Industry Day will be UNCLASSIFIED with information that is ITAR restricted and therefore attendance is limited to individuals who are only U.S. citizens and representatives of U.S. companies.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,<br>(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and <br>(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br>(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br><br>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br>(ii) Examples. <br>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). <br>(2) Certification. <br>(j) Place of manufacture.

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)<br>(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br>(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.<br>(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).<br>(  ) TIN: --------------------.<br>(  ) TIN has been applied for.<br>(  ) TIN is not required because:<br>(  ) Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States;<br>(  ) Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government;<br>(  ) Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government.<br><br>(4) Type of organization.<br>(  ) Sole proprietorship;<br>(  ) Partnership;<br>(  ) Corporate entity (not tax-exempt);<br>(  ) Corporate entity (tax-exempt);<br>(  ) Government entity (Federal, State, or local);<br>(  ) Foreign government;<br>(  ) International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4;<br>(  ) Other ----------.<br>(5) Common parent.<br>(  ) Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent;<br>(  ) Name and TIN of common parent:<br>Name --------------------.<br>TIN --------------------.<br><br>(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: ____________Technical Capabilities_______________ _________________Price______________________ For evaluation purposes, Technical Factor is more important than Price Factor. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of Provision) 52.211-8      TIME OF DELIVERY (JUN 1997) 
(a) The Government requires delivery to be made according to the following schedule: 
REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE 
Initial Design/Development and Publication (CLIN 0001)	50 days after contract awardOptions for additional publications				within 21 days of option exercise
The Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply.

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database;

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) is an independent Federal entity that is responsible for U.S.-funded non-military international broadcasting. BBG oversees, through an umbrella organization called the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), the Voice of America (VOA), and Radio and TV Marti (referred to collectively as the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB)). VOA is headquartered in Washington, DC. OCB is located in Miami, FL.
<p>The upcoming BBG International Audience Research Program (IARP) Request for Proposal (RFP) will seek potential contractors to provide analytics of BBG's international audience in order to support BBG's mission. It is estimated that the annual total amount of Task Orders to be issued under the planned contract will fall within the $5M - $10M price range.</p>
<p>BBG intends to award a Performance-Based IDIQ contract under which it will issue Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Task Orders.</p>

<p>FAR 52.233-1 Disputes (Jul 2002) <br />FAR 52.233-2 Protests After Award (Aug 1996)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offers-Commercial Items. Addenda to 52.212-1; the following paragraphs are hereby deleted from this provision: (e) multiple offers and (h) multiple awards.</p>
<p>NOTE: To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104. Registration may be done on line at: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>52.211-6 -- Brand Name or Equal (Aug 1999)<br />(a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as "brand name or equal," the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified in the solicitation.<br />(b) To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must-<br />(1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation;<br />(2) Clearly identify the item by-<br />(i) Brand name, if any; and<br />(ii) Make or model number;<br />(3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and<br />(4) Clearly describe any modification the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modification.<br />(c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.<br />(d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation.<br />(End of Provision)<br />DLAD 52.233-9000 AGENCY PROTESTS (SEP 1999)<br />Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Provision)<br />DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES: AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) (JUN 2001)<br />(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise.

Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.<br />(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.<br />(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here ( ).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/competitive solicitation, the US Forest Service intends to negotiate to acquire Image Segmentation Software and Associated Maintenance.<br />Image Segmentation is an automated process for delineating land cover as seen on imagery into manageable units which can then be used for analysis by land resource managers. Image segmentation entails dividing digital imagery into cohesive units or regions based on both spectral and contextual spatial information. Traditionally, the process of delineating land cover into manageable units has been accomplished through the use of aerial photography which was photo interpreted, and then hand digitized into a digital format suitable for a Geographic Information System (GIS). Image segmentation has replaced this process as a cost effective solution to an important information need in the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USFS). <br />Given the cost structure of the current image segmentation software used in the USFS and a need for additional users to have access, a more cost effective solution is needed. This will, in part, be achieved by moving Image Segmentation Software services to a central location in the USFS at the Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC) located in Salt Lake City Ut. The attached Performance Work Statement provides the requirements for this software acquisition and associated maintenance.
<p>This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. Request for Proposal (RFP).<br />AG-7604-S-11-0085 is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Image Segmentation Software. <br />Submit written offers only, oral offers will not be accepted. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-50. It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions. Clauses and provisions can be found at https://www.acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.</p>
<p>This procurement is being issued as open market. North American Industrial Classification Standard 423430 or like. Vendors who do not fit this can still submit their Proposal. <br />Proposals submitted from GSA Schedule and non GSA Schedule holders will be accepted.</p>
<p>The Government will accept the offer that is considered the most advantageous (best value) to the Government using a performance/cost trade-off method of selection. The Government's source selection decision will be based on the following factors, listed in descending order of importance: (1) Technical, (2) Cost, and (3) Past Performance. The Technical factor is more important than cost in that (a) all acceptable offers must meet at least the minimum technical requirements specified in the Performance of Work Statement in order to be considered, and (b) offers that include technical capabilities that exceed the minimum technical requirements will be evaluated based on a performance/cost trade-off methodology. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal/offer meets the criteria and can demonstrate their software will run on the USFS network in accordance with the factors in the Evaluation Criteria attached. The ultimate award decision will be made based on a determination of overall best value.</p>
<p>Offeror should submit a price proposal and a technical proposal separately. Font size must be at least 11. Included in the offeror's technical portion, offeror should provide past performance information as stated of most recent and relevant projects. Include the name, any contract number, brief description, and date of the project. Also include a point of contact with email address and phone number.</p>

<DESC>FLENUMMETOCCEN has used TeamForge software as a collaboration tool since 2003.  As an established tool, it is familiar to all personnel at the command; switching software would require re-training costs, plus costs to integrate any new software.  In addition, the thousands of files already hosted by TeamForge would have to be migrated to any new solution, at a very great cost of time and manpower.

Also, TeamForge has been registered and approved for FLENUMMETOCCEN in MAAD/DADMS.  Other tools may not be approved and certainly are not associated with FLENUMMETOCCEN.  Even if an approved tool could be found, there is no guarantee that it will be approved for use at FLENUMMETOCCEN.

For these reasons, FLENUMMETOCCEN must continue to maintain TeamForge and needs licenses and support for this software.

The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
 Only the source(s) previously approved by the government for this item have been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Naval Inventory Control Point Philadelphia Source Approval Information Brochure.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.
 Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.  The NAVICP Commercial Item Identification Brochure is now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx"

<p>(End of Provision)<br />52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Governments evaluation of quotations will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under 52.212-1 of 1.) Technical Capability , 2.) Past Performance, and 3.) Price. The evaluation of these factors will utilize an award basis that results in an award to the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation, that has been assigned an acceptable past performance rating. Quotes that do not meet the stated minimum technical specifications, will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award. In addition, vendor's that are assigned an unacceptable past performance rating will not be considered for award. Finally, quotations that are incomplete and/or are determined to be priced unreasonably too high or too low, may not be selected for award. Therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms, from a price, technical-specification, and past performance standpoint. Under the LPTA source selection process, trade-offs are not permitted, proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-price factors.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Technical:</p>
<p>The government will evaluate technical proposals and the below listed sub-factors in accordance with the SOW on a pass/fail-basis, assigning ratings of acceptable, or unacceptable. An unacceptable rating for any of the below sub-factors will result in an unacceptable rating for this Technical Capability primary factor. Accordingly, under the LPTA source selection approach, vendors who receive an unacceptable rating for this factor, will not be considered for award. Technical Acceptability shall be evaluated against the following sub-factors:</p>
<p>Technical ratings will be evaluated entailing a comparison of quoted specifications with relation to specifications of the government's requirements, and qualifications. If the associated qualifications of any quoted service do not meet the Government's stated minimum qualification, may result in a vendor's entire quotation being ineligible for award.</p>
<p>As a result of the government's evaluation of the aforementioned Technical Capability sub-factors of Job Qualifications and all associated elements accordingly, a determination of acceptable of unacceptable will be assigned using the following ratings and descriptions:</p>
<p>Technical Capability Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>ii. Past Performance: Past performance ratings will be evaluated using the list of current/recent and relevant references provided by vendors. A telephone interview will be conducted by the government to evaluate each vendors past performance to determine whether or not the services met contract requirements, and also if the services were performed in accordance with prescribed performance schedules. The result of the assessment will determine if a vendor's past performance on recent and relevant contracts was favorable, or unfavorable. Failure by vendors to submit past performance information, or the inability to accurately reference points of contacts may result not being selected for award.</p>
<p>The evaluation of past performance information will result in an overall assessment of satisfactory or unsatisfactory as follows:</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Satisfactory Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort<br />Unsatisfactory Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>iii. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness and affordability, an initial screening of quotations will be performed to compare pricing to both Government and commercial web-based databases, and with comparison to the Government's estimate, and in relation to the service quoted. Quotations that are determined to be priced unreasonably, as either too high or too low, may not be selected for award.</p>
<p>(c) Award Determination: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose proposals are determined to be technically acceptable and that have been assigned a satisfactory past performance rating, will be considered for award. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, and assigned satisfactory past performance ratings, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror whose price is determined reasonable and affordable.</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of a quotation, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful vendor within the time for acceptance specified in the quotation, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the vendor's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quotation.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This clause takes precedence over any Government inspection and testing required in the contract's specifications, except for specialized inspections or tests specified to be performed solely by the Government.</p>
<p><br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis
<p>Proposals from all business concerns will be accepted for the Design-Build (D-B) of an interchange at SR 85 and West McWhorter Avenue at the Eglin Air Force Base (Eglin AFB) located in Okaloosa County, Florida, Solicitation Number: DTFH71-11-R-00001. The proposed interchange will replace a signalized intersection with an overpass interchange. Steel structures will not be considered. The D-B contract for the project includes, but is not limited to, the design and construction of a bridge over SR 85 that meets the traffic requirements, ramps from SR 85 to the bridge, access across SR 85 for large very heavy equipment (75 ton plus tractor trailer) either on the bridge or on RR 215, access to nearby Forest Service facilities, temporary roads as needed to maintain access to Eglin AFB, storm water management (SWM) facilities (removal and relocation as needed), utility relocation coordination, and removal of the existing traffic signal. The work is anticipated to include, among other things, design, utility relocations, adjustments and coordination (as needed), water quality permit acquisition and obtaining of all required environmental permits as required for construction of this project, roadway and bridge construction, quality assurance and quality control for design and construction, temporary roadway pavements for access to the Eglin AFB, and overall project management.</p>
<p>Environmental Compliance (Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)) has been completed. The selected contractor will be responsible for all required environmental permits for the project.</p>
<p>The project is to occur completely on federal lands controlled by Eglin AFB. SR 85 is an easement through Eglin AFB, not Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) or FDOT property. The U.S. Air Force will be providing an easement to provide additional right-of-way, and this action does require a change in land use in the easement. The intent is to obtain a temporary right of entry during construction and to get a permanent easement once construction is complete. Gas, water, and electrical utilities all have active right of way in the area. Right of way easements would need to be<br />updated to reflect any changes in utility placements. Please note that any utilities will need to be relocated or avoided. The design and construction cost for award exceed $10,000,000. The project at this time is "Subject to Availability of Funding". It is intended that SR 85 will be widened to three lanes in each direction in the future. This project should be designed in such a manner that significant reconstruction will not be needed for this future project.</p>
<p>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 36.3 - Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, the Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division (EFLHD) of the FHWA is conducting a "two phased" D-B selection process for Eglin AFB and FDOT. The project will be split into two bid options; either Schedule A OR Schedule B will be awarded based on the availability of funding. If Schedule A is awarded, all work on the project needs to be completed by the end of May 2013. If Schedule B is awarded, all work on the project needs to be completed by the end of June 2013. Solicitation documents for Phase One, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), should be issued on or about October 12, 2010. Qualifications due date and location will be specified on the SF 1442 of the solicitation documents. An evaluation board will review and evaluate contractor qualifications and select the three most highly qualified D-B firms/teams to participate in Phase Two of this D-B selection process. Selection will be based on the established RFQ evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>During Phase Two, those firms/teams short-listed will be sent a Request for Proposal (RFP), which will outline the remainder of the process requirements including submission of technical and cost proposals and be invited to give a presentation. The Phase Two RFP is anticipated to be issued in January 2011 with contract award anticipated in April, 2011. A site visit will be scheduled during the RFP phase.</p>
<p>Please send all questions concerning this D-B project to eflhd.contracts@dot.gov. Include the solicitation number, project name and number, requesting firm and address, a point of contact and telephone number. Requests for 'faxing' or overnight mailing will not be accepted.</p>

<CONTACT>Dr. Dennis Polla, Email dni-iarpa-baa-11-09@ugov.gov
<DESC>SYNOPSIS:<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Trusted Integrated Chips (TIC) Program on July 27, 2011 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 am to 3:30 pm in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the TIC Program, to address questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS:<br />Recent developments in the semiconductor industry show tremendous opportunity for the realization of integrated circuits and systems-on-a-chip derived from state-of-the art foundry processes. The ability of semiconductor foundries to realize multiple types of integrated circuits, MEMS, and other More-Than-Moore capabilities will likely continue in the future. In particular, such foundry processes are not only demonstrating exceptionally high performance in several technology areas, but also demonstrating low-cost, fast turn-around time, and high yield. In addition to maintaining our supply and access to integrated circuits derived from the U.S. Trusted Foundry, it is important for both the Intelligence Community and other government agencies to have access to other state-of-the art manufacturing capabilities derived from world foundries with assurance that such chips are safe and secure without malicious circuitry or reliability concerns. In addition, the protection of design intent and systems performance is an important goal to be realized in TIC.</p>
<p>The TIC Program aims to develop new approaches to chip fabrication where security and intellectual property concerns would otherwise prohibit the use of off-shore manufacturing foundries. Specifically, TIC seeks to address secure foundry manufacturing of chips in several ways:</p>
<p>1) Development of split-manufacturing processes in which a Front-End-of Line (FEOL) process defines transistor building blocks up to the point of the first or second metallization followed by a Back-End-of-Line (BEOL) process in which remaining metallizations are carried out in secure trusted facilities in the U.S. Initially, the logistics and compatibility of using more than one fabrication facility at the 130 nm node will be of concern.</p>
<p>2) Chip obfuscation methods whereby the intent of digital and analog functions and their associated building blocks are disguised in their function within the FEOL process.</p>
<p>3) New verification methods that ensure that no malicious circuitry has been added during fabrication. New ideas that are different from those being explored in other federal research programs, such as DARPA's TRUST and IRIS programs, are encouraged.</p>
<p>4) New approaches to 3-D fabrication at significant semiconductor manufacturing nodes. This includes new transistor/circuit designs and creative stacking methods such as those which may be required for integrated MEMS and III-V-on-Si chips.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the TIC Program will logically scale its capabilities over a four year period having started with a core 130 nm-node capability and subsequently moving toward a 22 nm capability at the end of a four year period. It is expected that methodologies to be demonstrated will define both high-performance integrated circuits and integrated systems such as MEMS over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>If successful, the TIC Program will have demonstrated a new ability for both the U.S. government and industry to realize safe and secure integrated chips having protected functional goals and proprietary circuit designs. Collaborative efforts and teaming among potential performers will be strongly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary with capabilities including: circuit design, chip manufacturing, and characterization.</p>
<p>IARPA anticipates that universities and companies from around the world will participate in this program.</p>
<p><br />REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br /><strong>Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm Eastern July 20, 2011 at </strong><a href="https://conference.brtrc.com/tic_pd/"><strong>https://conference.brtrc.com/tic_pd/</strong></a><strong>.</strong> &nbsp; Directions to the conference facility and other materials will be available on that website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 140 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the conference. Non-US citizens will be required to submit a visit request form for Foreign Nationals at least 5 business days prior to the conference. The form and submission instructions can be found on the registration website.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for potential teaming opportunities may request to do so by sending an e-mail along with their presentation to dni-iarpa-baa-11-09@ugov.gov . Presentations will be limited to 10 minutes with a maximum of 5 slides (MS PowerPoint or PDF format). Opportunities to present will be limited by time and will therefore be on a first-to-ask basis. Deadline for requests is close of business (5:00pm Eastern) July 18, 2011. It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all materials briefed are appropriately marked and approved for presentation by their organization. The IARPA Point of Contact will review and approve all presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA nor participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) will issue a solicitation for SITE CHARACTERIZATION (ASSESSMENT) AND REMEDIATION OF LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS (LUSTs) IN INDIAN COUNTRY, which will support the mission of the Office of Underground Storage Tanks (OUST) within the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER).  This action is set-aside as an 8(a) competitive solicitation in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.8.  Only SBA certified 8(a) firms may apply.  Offers from other than 8(a) certified firms will not be considered.  This procurement aims to ensure that leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs) in the United States do not pose a threat to human health and the environment.  The background, goals, policies and statutes relevant to the Office of Underground Storage Tanks (OUST) program can be accessed via the Internet at the following web address: http://www.epa.gov/OUST.  OUST, in partnership with EPA's regional offices, implements the LUST program in Indian Country, and provides technical support to clean up petroleum releases from USTs.
The general types of support functions the Office of Underground Storage Tanks (OUST) shall require with this procurement include, but are not limited to: evaluating sites for  LUST-eligibility; conducting site assessments (e.g., testing tanks for leaks when a leak is suspected, investigating a site to evaluate the source and extent of petroleum contamination); remediating contaminated sites;  providing technical field assistance to EPA for enforcement responsibilities; and providing outreach materials to assist with cleaning up petroleum releases from underground storage tanks, primarily in Indian Country, throughout the United States.  This is a follow-on effort to expiring Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts, EP-W-07-104, that currently supports OUST; and two expiring CPFF contracts, EP-W-08-072 and EP-W-08-073, which currently support the Region 8 LUST program.   EPA anticipates awarding one hybrid (T&M/FFP) IDIQ contract to support this requirement with a two (2) year base period, three (3) 12-month option periods, and two (2) 12-month award periods, for a maximum performance potential of seven (7) years. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this procurement is 562910 - Environmental Remediation Services with a size standard of 500 employees.  EPA intends to obtain proposals through a competitive procurement process using FAR Part 15 procedures.  Award will be made to the responsible 8(a) contractor whose proposal represents best value to the Government.  The solicitation and all information pertaining to this procurement will be available on or about June 30, 2011, at EPA's "Business Opportunities with EPA" Internet World Wide Website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/index.htm.  
Information related to this procurement including any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted here on the Federal Business Opportunities website at: www.fbo.gov and the EPA website at: http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/lasc/LUSTs/index.htm.

The Mission requires a secure environment to conduct their mission.

The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks.
<p>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a time and materials contract, with firm-fixed price and cost reimbursable elements, for local guard services, on behalf of the U.S. Mission Maputo. The Government will solicit this requirement as a full and open competition using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The Government plans to award one contract as a result of this acquisition.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options, which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is&nbsp;<strong>1,045,472</strong> hours.</p>
<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. The Project Manager must possess a Level 3 language proficiency, which requires an ability to speak English with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on practical, social, and professional topics.</p>
<p>The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: the synopsis will be posted for <strong>at least thirty (30)&nbsp;days</strong>. On or about <strong>April 25,</strong> 2011, the Government plans to post the solicitation. No paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals. A contract is expected to be awarded within 120 days of proposal submission. All dates are subject to change.</p>
<p>A site visit is will be scheduled within twenty-one (21) days of solicitation release. The date of the site visit will be in Section L of the solicitation, when released. All interested parties must register in order to be granted access to the U.S. Mission Maputo.</p>
<p>The Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period opens with the posting of the synopsis and end twenty-one (21) calendar days before proposals are due. Offerors may inquire about security risks by specific countries during this period. The solicitation, when finalized, will be available on the Internet at www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>
<p>All announcements and amendments made to the solicitation will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov. To receive updates, click on "Register to Receive Notification". Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Larry Pruitt Jr. at PruittLA@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>All proposals from responsible vendors will be evaluated if received on time. All prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the offeror who submitted a technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<DESC>AS OF 6/24/2011 - FOR THE PURPOSES OF FURTHER MARKET RESEARCH, THIS RFI IS HEREBY AMMENDED:

The United States Marine Corps is currently seeking information for the research and development of a Common Laser Range Finder Integrated Capability (CLRF IC) system to replace the currently fielded CLRF suite of equipment.  The Marine Corps has a requirement to provide a device that will incorporate the various components of the CLRF suite of equipment into one system.  This system will provide improved integrated night-vision capability, internal Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) GPS, non-magnetic azimuth capability, and limit the need for external components, cables, and batteries.
  

A draft of the Performance Specification for the Common Laser Range Finder Integrated Capability Light has been included with this Request for Information (RFI) for vendor comment.  Vendors capable of developing a system that demonstrates the specifications listed in the Performance Specification are invited to submit a response to this RFI.  Vendors should submit descriptions of their design concept that will convey their ability to develop the system as well as their risk areas, nominal schedule, and cost estimates.  Vendors are also requested to identify any specifications which may drive excessive cost or technical risk.  Vendors should address their ability to comply with all security requirements with respect to including a SAASM GPS within their system and whether a requirement for the use of a Government-furnished GB Gram may impact their design concept.
 

Interested sources are requested to respond no later than 4:30pm EST on 15 JULY 2011 stating their CAGE Code, DUNS number, copy of GSA schedule(if appropriate), business size, SIC Code, and the complete contract information for a corporate point of contact.  Interested sources should respond to:  

Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN:  FSS/Contracts (attn: L.D. Gilman), 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134 

OR VIA EMAIL:

Proprietary information shall be clearly marked.  This RFI is for planning purposes and shall not be construed as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as obligation on the part of the Government to acquire products or services.
  

Responses shall be treated as information only and part of market research and will not be shared outside of the Government.  All information shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government, no entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government as a result of contractor responses to this announcement.

<DESC>This solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting in the award of a single firm fixed price (FFP) contract. The Request for Proposal will be issued on or about February 9, 2011 and the Proposal Due Date will be on or about March 11, 2011. The estimated value of this work is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00. Proposals received in response to this solicitation will be evaluated in accordance with procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for Best Value. NAICS Code: 237990. This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement. The site is located at the BNSF Railroad crossing, immediately east of the Davis Pond Diversion Canal near Ama, La, and north of the two tracks, the existing levee alignment would transition to a floodwall section consisting of sheet pile I-wall, reinforced concrete T-wall, and steel floodgate built to El.+13.5, 13.0, and 15.0 NAVD88, respectively. The total length of floodwall is approximately 150 feet and requires an approximate 60-foot easement for the construction of the railroad floodgate structure. Work included within this project consists of the following: Steel Swing Gate at BNSF Railroad Crossing, Government-designed temporary falsework, Government-designed temporary retaining structures/temporary flood protection, construction dewatering, concrete reinforced T-Walls, clearing and grubbing, structural excavation and backfill, turf establishment and maintenance, painting, driving steel sheet piling, driving steel h-piles, driving steel pipe piles, and other incidental work. The railroad gate will require contractors to drive steel H-piling and steel sheet piling, pour base slabs, install false work (temporary bridging consisting of steel pipe piling and structural steel superstructure) for the rail road tracks, construct reinforced concrete floodwall stems, and install steel flood gates in very limited windows of time to facilitate keeping both tracks in service during construction, since this railroad line is reported to be the busiest in the state of Louisiana. The Contractor will be required to provide means to clear railroad ROW quickly should any breakdowns or equipment failures occur (this could mean providing redundant cranes, etc.). Any delays will incur a substantial fine by the railroad company on the construction contractor. As such, a certain level of insurance and bonding capacity will be required as follows: <br>Contractor, Public and Railroad's Protective Public Liability and Property Damage Liability <br>Combined Single Limit for Bodily Injury Liability, Property Damage Liability and Physical Damage to Property - $2,000,000 per occurrence. <br>Aggregate Limit - $6,000,000 for the term of the policy. <br>For AMTRAK - Aggregate Limit - $12,000,000 for the term of the policy. <br><br>Selection will be based on the following criteria, with non-cost factors being more important than price. Factors 1, 2, and 3 are comparatively equal. Factor 4 is less significant than factor 1, 2, and 3. Factor 5 is less significant than factors 1, 2, 3, and 4. (1) Past Performance Risk which includes Safety (2) Technical Approach and Key Personnel (3) Proposed Construction Duration (4) Small Business Participation Plan (5) Price. Factor 5 will not be scored, but will be subjectively evaluated for reasonableness by the board. These evaluation factors are subject to change. Any changes to evaluation factors will be shown in the solicitation. The solicitation will include a detailed list of evaluation factors, including any sub-factors or elements, and will provide instructions for proposal requirements and the basis for award. The Government will not provide written paper copies of the solicitation. Telephone, written, facsimile, or e-mail requests for the solicitation package will not be honored. Potential Offerors MUST register on FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov/ in order to receive notification(s) and/or change(s) to the solicitation.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>The Government requirement is to provide personnel, facilities, materials (except as otherwise provided), and management, preparation, and completion of tasks in Support for Military Medical Research for the Soldier (SMMRS) at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD. The objectives and specific tasks described in the statement of work (SOW) will seek to improve both the national and international efforts to develop drugs, vaccines, and associated products to address diseases of strategic interest to the US Military, and to develop products to enhance Warfighter resilience, and reduce and mitigate the impact of brain injury, and combat stress. Contract support to carry out the Objectives and Specific Tasks outlined in the SOW is required to implement two (2) major research programs and activities to execute the mission of the WRAIR. One is to develop interventions to prevent and treat infectious diseases, and the other is to develop tools and interventions for military psychiatry and neuroscience. In the broadest sense the contractor will: provide administrative, communications, IT and financial reporting support; provide operational, acquisition and logistics support required to carry out program objectives; provide technical, clinical trial and scientific research support; provide government liaison support; provide facility and security support; provide training and instructional support; provide support for the exchange of scientific findings; and provide support of marketing and public relations projects to foster the reputation of the SMMRS.<br><br>This action is unrestricted and will not be set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 8731. The Government anticipates a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) award of a 1-year contract from date of award with 4 one-year options. Estimated date of award is August 31, 2010. All offerors must provide a written technical proposal discussing specified technical evaluation factors. This is a new requirement, there is no incumbent. Award will be made on a best value basis. Those interested in obtaining the solicitation should download it from the United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) homepage: www.usamraa.army.mil and click on Solicitation W81XWH-10-R-0036. It will also be available at https://acquisition.army.mil. Requests by phone will not be accepted. No solicitations will be provided by hard copy, fax, or e-mail. All offerors are responsible for checking for amendments to the solicitation from the Internet. It is the responsibility of the vendor to ensure that the RFP is received from the Internet accurately and in its entirety. To be <br>eligible for an award or payment from any DOD activity, offerors must be registered with <br>the Central Contractor Registry at http://www.ccr.gov and have completed the on-line <br>representations and certifications located at http://orca.bpn.gov. POC for this action is Nicola Ohaegbu at Nicola.Ohaegbu@us.army.mil. No questions will be addressed at this time.<br><br>
