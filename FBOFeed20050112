STATEMENT OF WORK

HU-25
ICE Protocol Upgrade to PTAC

05 January 2005




 
1.0	Background	The USCG needs to have the OASIS processors on its HU-25C and HU-25D airframes modified.  The ICE (Imaging and Communications Environment) program on the HU-25 presently uses TACO2 as its protocol (imbedded operating system).  During the initial modification of the HU-25 sensor aircraft, the C-130 upgraded its ICE protocol from TACO2 to PTAC on its CASPER equipped airframes.  PTAC protocol is also being used by MIFC (Maritime Intelligence Fusion Center) and PACAREA.  In addition, the Seventh District Operations Center will be installing a desktop version of the OASIS system for connectivity with air and surface assets in their AOR in February 2005.  They will also be operating their ICE with PTAC protocol.

2.0		Purpose	   The purpose of this contract is to allow imaging and track data to be communicated between the HU-25 and other USCG assets.  The HU-25 aircraft needs to have its ICE protocol upgraded to PTAC.

3.0	Program Schedule 
The Contractor shall develop and maintain an integrated program schedule to support its management needs and for reporting purposes.  The program schedule shall present an integrated schedule plan for the design, development, and test, of the PTAC protocol installation.  The initial program schedule shall be delivered 1 month after receipt of order in Contractor Format.  Any changes or delays to the program schedule shall be discussed with, and approved by, the Government’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR).
CDRL    A001 	 Program Schedule	

4.0 	Scope		The scope of this contract will encompass the following activities:

4.1	The contractor shall perform the necessary hardware and software upgrades to the 18 USCG – owned OASIS processors (p/n 102689-00) in order for the ICE program in the OASIS processors to use PTAC as its protocol. The upgrades shall be in two phases.

4.2	Phase 1 - The contractor shall perform initial upgrade installation on two (2) OASIS processors.  In addition, the OASIS processors shall be loaded with the most recent version of ODS software at that time.  Testing on the first two processors shall be performed at the contractor’s facility.  After successfully testing of the first two OASIS processors, system testing onboard an HU-25 shall be performed to verify the connectivity between two USCG assets utilizing PTAC as the protocol for ICE.  In addition, the new ODS software shall be operationally tested.  One contractor representative shall travel from contractor’s facility to USCG Air Station Miami to perform the above-required tests.  This testing shall be witnessed and verified by a qualified (HU-25 SSO qualified) USCG representative.  Successful completion of above testing shall complete Phase 1.
CDRL    B001 	 Phase 1 Completion and Test Report	




4.3	Phase 2  Note: Phase 2 shall not commence until Phase 1 is completed.  Phase 2 will encompass the modification of the remaining 16 HU-25 OASIS processors.  These 16 processors shall be delivered to the contractor’s facility, by the USCG, on a rotating (nose to tail) schedule for their upgrade modification.  The contractor shall send the modified processors back to the USCG field units for installation.  Coordination and scheduling of processor throughput shall be with the HU-25 Projects Office at the USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (AR&SC). Upon installation of the PTAC protocol and accompanied ODS software upgrades, the contractor shall perform a functionality, quality assurance test/check of the PTAC upgrade in each OASIS processor prior to return shipment to the USCG.  After modification of the remaining 16 OASIS processors, coupled with the final delivery to the USCG, the contractor shall submit a completion report to the USCG COTR for review and acceptance.
CDRL    B002 	 Phase 2 Completion Report

Under this effort, the contractor shall redesign the existing HPCs to address fitment, production, obsolescence, and reliability issues as well as fabricate six (6) new cables to support the U.S. Navy Fleet.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  G&H Technology (GHT) is the original equipment manufacturer and sole supplier of the AN/SQQ-32 (V) Hull Penetrator Cable.  As such, only GHT has the expertise, owns the technical data package, equipment, and experienced personnel to successfully re-design, safely modify, fabricate, and test the hull penetrator cable in new configurations to address all reliability and obsolescence issues.  GHT is the only company that has conducted all hydrodyn! amic analysis to date on the AN/SQQ-32 (V) hull penetrator cable.  Use of another company to re-design and test the new hull penetrator cable may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable errors into the AN/SQQ-32(V).   These errors could result in significant damage and maybe even loss of the AN/SQQ-32(V) Minehunting Sonar Set.  Therefore it is imperative that this effort is awarded to GHT immediately.

<DESC>This is a combined commercial item synopsis/solicitation prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This announcement is a request for quote.  This request for quote will be evaluated in accordance with lowest price, technically acceptable solicitation procedures detailed in FAR 15.101-2.  To be considered technically acceptable the quote must contain information about the proposed recovery method.  Any proposed recovery method must insure minimal damage is caused to the buoy or its instruments. The solicitation number is QA1330-05-RQ-1137 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-27.  The contract will be a firm-fixed price order.  The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) Stennis Space Center, MS 39529 requires service to retrieve a 6-meter buoy from the beach at Yakutat Bay, Alaska in accordance with the following statement of work (SOW):
STATEMENT OF WORK
Retrieve 6N36 from Yakutat Bay, AK
GENERAL:
This document defines the task required to retrieve NDBC buoy 6N36 from the beach at Yakutat Bay Alaska and return the buoy to a nearby pier in the Yakutat area.  The contractor will provide all labor, equipment, hardware, disposal fees, to salvage the buoy.  NDBC will arrange for and pay the temporarily storage costs once pier side. 6N36 is a 6-meter boat-shaped buoy with a forward and aft mast and appears to be buried approximately 2 feet.  See attached photographs of the buoy.
BACKGROUND:
The buoy 6N36 was deployed at station 46083.  On October 25, 2004, buoy 6N36 went adrift from its mooring drifting into Yakutat Bay and grounding on the North East side.  A backup position indicator is still functioning and a fly over confirmed the buoy to be at position (590 48.0 degrees N, 1390 53.6 degrees W).
The buoy is boat-shaped, 20 ft long, and 9.8 ft wide, with a hull depth of 7 ft.  The buoy hull displaces 13,900 lb, with a reserve buoyancy capacity of 19,733 lb.  The upper mooring attaches to a stainless steel yoke and weighs 2000 lb.  The buoy has four compartments the forward and aft compartments contain foam.     The two center compartments contain the buoy's batteries and electronic equipment.  There are 43 Cegasa batteries and six Concorde batteries.  The buoy can be lifted using the four lift padeyes, or towed using the yoke, bow padeye, or towing hole in the keel.  The aft padeye (above the keel) is not designed to lift loads and will break if loaded. 
The buoy may have a high concentration of hydrogen due to the batteries discharging without venting.  In addition the batteries may have cracked and mixed with sea water, causing a caustic solution.  The buoy interior should be considered a confined space.
SCOPE OF WORK:
The salvage company will remove the buoy from the beach of Yakutat Bay and move to a nearby pier in the Yakutat area.  The preferred method of removing the buoy from the beach is by lifting with a helicopter.  If possible recover the failed component in the buoy's mooring.
The salvage company will verify the buoy's atmosphere before entry.  Buoy atmosphere shall be verified at the vent and hatch plugs prior to entry in accordance with applicable OSHA standards.     
Remove the forward and aft mast from the buoy if the buoy needs to be lifted.  If the masts are removed prepare the buoy by covering the buoy opening and securing the buoy's masts, and yoke.
NDBC will arrange and pay to ship the buoy to Stennis Space Center Mississippi.
All offerors shall submit a firm-fixed price quote. The quote shall include the unit price based on a daily rate.  The daily rate shall include all costs associated with this effort. The following FAR provisions or clauses apply to this acquisition: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Order-Commercial Items; 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration; 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration; 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965, as Amended; 52.247-21 Contractor Liability for Personal Injury and/or Property; 52.247-21 Contractor Liability for Personal Injury and/or Property Damage; 52.228-9 Cargo Insurance.  The buoy is valued at $180,000.00. Offerors are to include a completed copy of FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items. Quotes may be faxed to 228-688-3153 or emailed to Dennis.Morris@noaa.gov, or mailed to: National Data Buoy Center, Attn: Dennis Morris, Building 1100 Room 360, Stennis Space Center, MS 39529.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Government intends to award on an other than full and open competition contract, a Firm Fixed Price, five year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.  The contractor shall furnish all depot level labor, facilities, special tooling, test equipment and materials/parts for Overhaul and Recapitalization of:  T700-GE-700 Cold Section Modules, Input/Output NSN: 2840-01-094-5547, P/N: 6035T02G01 minimum quantity is 50, and maximum quantity of 250 each;  T700-GE-701 Cold Section Mod ules, Input/Output NSN: 2840-01-121-0751, P/N: 6044T07G01 minimum quantity is 20, and maximum quantity of 100 each; T700-GE-701C Cold Section Modules, Input/Output NSN: 2840-01-284-4013, P/N: 6071T25G01 minimum quantity is 90, and maximum quantity of 450 e ach. The overhaul and recapitalization will be accomplished in accordance with Depot Maintenance Work Requirement 1-2840-248-1 and 1-2840-248-2, with Change 5 and all applicable Maintenance Engineering Orders (MEO).  The DMWR requires utilizing an automati c data acquisition and reduction program (DRP), which must be approved by AMCOM for performance testing.  Use of the DRP allows the cold section to be evaluated on its own merit instead of being passed due to the strength of the slave engine.  This in turn  ensures that the cold sections sent to the field indeed meet requirements and results in maximum on-wing life.  At the present, the only company possessing a DRP approved by AMCOM is General Electric.  Responsible businesses that can perform the above eff ort may submit an offer, which may be considered by the Agency. Due to the backlog in the AMCOM testing facility, approval for DRP could be in excess of one year. Award of this effort is urgent and will not be delayed awaiting approval of other sources.  T his requirement is currently unfunded.  Award will be withheld pending receipt of sufficient funds.  The closing date annotated is an estimated date and may be adjusted dependent upon the date of release of solicitation; however, solicitation will not clos e prior to the closing date stated above.  Foreign Firms are reminded that all requests for solicitation must be processed through their respective embassies, not direct to AMCOM.   No telephone or e-mail requests will be accepted.  Request must be by data  fax or mail only.

<CONTACT>Cheryle Lankford, Trini Rendon,(937) 904-4197, (937)904-4286
<DESC>UPDATE, 12 JAN 05:  The final RFP is hereby released.  Also attached are the Acquisition Schedule and 2 PCO letters (Source Selection  Notification and Request for Proposal).  Please note Shannon Prince is no longer a POC for this effort.  The current POCs are:  Cheryle Lankford (937-904-4197), Capt. Jason Ortiz (937-904-4609) and Trini Rendon (937-904-4286). UPDATE, 3 JAN 05:  Regarding the Draft RFP posted 30 Dec 04, please be advised that the updated DRAFT RFP has a potential for up to a 10  year period of performance as opposed to the original 5 year period of performance.  All comments/questions to the current Draft RFP  should be received no later than 12:00 EST on 10 Jan 05.  The  Government may not respond with direct answers but may incorporate  comments into the Final RFP. UPDATE, 30 DEC 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) in response to the questions/comments to the DRFP posted 3 Nov 04.  Only documents with changes/updates are posted.  This includes the updated DRFP, Section L and Section M.  Blue change bars highlight changes made.  A document entitled "Industry Questions and Responses, 30 Dec 04" has also been posted.  Questions can be directed to Cheryle Lankford, 937-904-4197, or Capt. Jason Ortiz, 937-904-4609.  UPDATE, 24 NOV 04:  Our e-mail system went down November 12 and was out not fixed until sometime the following week.  As a result, some e-mail  was lost.  If you sent an e-mail responding to the draft RFP during that  time, it may not have been received.  If an e-mail was sent and you did not receive any response from our office advising receipt of the e-mail, please resubmit.  We apologize for any inconvenience. UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and  Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  colles being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to determine the  availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms responding  to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned  small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled  veteran-owned small business.

If you sent an e-mail responding to the draft RFP during that  time, it may not have been received.  If an e-mail was sent and you did not receive any response from our office advising receipt of the e-mail, please resubmit.  We apologize for any inconvenience. UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and  Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule iction of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.

THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.

<DESC>Note 22 applies.  The Government intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with High Tech Industries of Corona, CA for design,fabrication, and installation of custom consoles for a digital-server based radio broadcast system.  The consoles will provide expanded control capacities by combining various outboard functions to new centralized locations.  The custom design will allow similar viewing locations, workspace layout, and ergonomics of existing systems while incorporating new equipment consistent with the design of the digital-server radio broadcast system.  This requirement is time-sensitive because of the anticipated award of the digital radio project contract, and the need to make space for the digital radio section, which will change location from the shared space of the digital-server based television system presently in operation.  The digital television system uses consoles similar to the ones planned for this procurement, with design features that can be easily adapted for use by radio.  The television consoles were designed by High Tech Industries.

CLOSING DATE/TIME: 4:30 pm Cairo time on February 16, 2005
POSITION TITLE: Senior Education Advisor

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 2 years with possibility of extension. 
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/Sana’a, Yemen. 
SECURITY ACCESS: SECRET
AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens or U.S. resident aliens who are able to obtain a secret security clearance.

Note: A candidate who is otherwise qualified, but does not meet full requirements of the position, may be appointed as a trainee and be required to serve at a lower grade level for the period of one year.

A. ORGANIZATIONAL LOCATION OF POSITION:  Office of the USAID Representative, US Embassy, Sana’a, Yemen

B. 	POSITION TITLE OF DIRECT SUPERVISOR:
The Senior Education Advisor will be supervised by, and will report to, the Deputy USAID Representative to Yemen, US Embassy, Sana’a.

C.	SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:  The Senior Education Advisor will work in tandem with the Senior Program Specialist (FSN) to form the USAID/Yemen Education Support Team. The Deputy USAID Representative will review and approve the contractor’s work plan and performance measures. The incumbent will be expected to work independently, take initiative, and be responsible for advising on all aspects of USG supported education program activities.  In carrying out specific assignments, the incumbent will work closely with senior representatives from The Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG), international donor organizations, local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and senior U.S. Government (USG) officials at the US Embassy/Sana’a, USAID/Cairo and USAID/Washington.   S/He will be expected to coordinate and collaborate with the Embassy’s Pubic Diplomacy Education and Cultural Affairs unit.  

D.	WORK DESCRIPTION:

1.	Introduction
Despite a noticeable physical expansion in Yemen’s educational facilities in recent years the educational system still suffers from shortfalls of enrollment capacity and favors males and urban areas.  Literacy and enrollment indicators, especially for women, remain precarious.  Yemen’s gender gap is among the widest in the world, with only a 25% literacy rate for females as opposed to 68% literacy for males, and 15 percent higher child mortality for girls. Disparities are magnified in rural areas; for example, 27% of female youth in rural areas are literate as opposed to 82% of the female youth in urban areas . 

Compounding this problem are abysmally low enrollment, retention and completion rates for girls in both primary and secondary education.  Although Yemen witnessed a 30% increase in enrollment in basic education between 1995 and 2000, only one out of four girls in Yemen complete primary school. Gender disparities at higher levels of education are even worse, with secondary education gross enrollment ratios at 69% for boys and 25% for girls .

Economic factors as well as deep-rooted social and cultural attitudes and practices together with the poor quality and relevance of the education system account for low access to formal and non-formal educational opportunities for girls and women. 
 
2.	Development Response
The USAID response to the education in Yemen, within the boundaries of the Interim Strategic Plan 2003-2006, is framed in Strategic Objective 2.0: “Improved Basic Education, Especially for Women and Girls” Illustrative Indicators at the SO level include: Number of children, in quality, primary schools, Number of days that teachers are in the classroom, Number of adults and out-of-school youth who can read and do basic mathematics, Number of district health offices that share budget information with the community   

These SO 297-006 results are based on activities descried in three Intermediate Results: 
•	IR 6.1:  Enhanced Access to Quality Primary Education in the Public Sector
•	IR 6.2:  Increased Literacy and Numeracy opportunities at the Community Level.
•	IR 6.3:  Improved Public Sector Environment for Education 

USAID Education Focus: With nearly half (48.8% in 2000) of the population less than age 15, USAID’s primary focus of the education sector in Yemen is on basic education which accounts for 84% of those enrolled in school.  Only 11% of students are in secondary school, just 4.6% attend university and fewer than 1.1% of students are in technical, vocational or teacher training programs. [Source: ROYG Second Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development]  

Despite progress over the past decade and a firm commitment to basic education by the ROYG, there are several million children out of school and the problem is increasing due to the high rate of population growth.  The education gap is worse in rural areas, and girls are especially deprived.  There are limited opportunities for vocational or technical training.  The collection and use of data for education planning, especially at the local level, needs to be strengthened.  There is a shortage of classrooms and schools need to be planned and built and equipped in the correct locations and configurations to increase access.  Classroom interaction is essentially teacher-centered and concerned more with rote learning and memorization than with the development of the child’s cognitive abilities and analytical skills.  Education must become more relevant to the life experiences and needs of the students.  The quality of classroom teaching must be improved through enhanced formal pre-service education in the Teacher Training Institutes, in-service training and refresher courses in the use of new materials and techniques.  School management needs to be improved, and the involvement of parents and communities needs to be increased.

IR 6.1	Enhanced Access to Quality Primary Education in the Public Sector
Illustrative Activities:  The USAID program will construct, renovate and equip a limited number of elementary schools in partnership with community organizations with special attention to physical constraints to girls’ participation (e.g. separate latrines).   However, the majority of construction, rehabilitation and equipment will be supported by the USDA 416(b) local currency program.   To improve the quality of education, USAID will also train teachers (especially female teachers) and administrators with an emphasis on interactive, inquiry -based, teaching methods.  USAID will also explore opportunities to provide nutrition and other incentives to increase enrolment and retain children in school through other USDA programs (e.g. Food for Education).

Illustrative Indicators: number of teachers and administrators trained in interactive, inquiry-based, teaching methods; number of facilities improved; average number of days teachers spend in the classroom. 

IR 6.2	Increased Literacy and Numeracy  Opportunities at the Community Level 
With large numbers of children out of school (especially girls) and virtually all rural women uneducated and illiterate (Table 5), USAID education activities must reach out and provide life-experience-relevant, essential literacy and numeracy opportunities in rural communities.

Illustrative Activities: increase education outreach to adults (especially women) and out-of-school youth in rural communities; radio/video distance-learning activities; organize parents’ and women’s education circles, community-based organizations and teacher/parent committees. 

Illustrative Indicators: number of communities with education outreach activities; numbers of community-based organizations formed or strengthened; number of adults and out-of-school youth in literacy and mathematics programs.

IR 6.3	Improved Public Sector Environment for Education   
Illustrative Activities:  develop and implement district and governorate education plans with community participation; fund education planning and program grants; promote new teaching approaches such as interactive and inquiry-based, learning; improve policies and regulations; include life-skills in the curriculum; develop policies and activities for out-of-school youth; provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Education and to district and governorate education offices to implement the ROYG decentralization objects and the ROYG Basic Education Strategy; provide technical assistance to ROYG at all levels to collect, use and share education data for planning and management; explore IT applications to support program objectives.

Illustrative Indicators: number of district and governorate education plans and resource allocation budgets prepared with community participation; number of district and governorate education offices with data-based planning capacity; number of district education offices that share budget information with the community.

3.	Relationship to Other Strategic Objectives 
Education, literacy and numeracy activities will be linked to life skills/ issues such as reproductive health, child health and economic growth and improved food security.

The purpose of this categorization is to accomplish the following three objectives: (1) To inform prospective offerors that TMA presumes that award of a contract or order in the subject category will give rise to real or apparent OCIs with respect to requi rements in the other two categories, (2)To assist current contractors and prospective offerors in developing their own business strategies regarding participation in TMA requirements, where possible,to identify, avoid, and mitigate against OCIs, and (3)To ensure that all current contractors and prospective offerors are afforded the maximum practicable opportunity to compete for all TMA requirements consistent with the restrictions required under FAR Subpart 9.5 and sound business practices.  Potential bidders with business relationships with the Tricare Mail Order Pharmacy contractor (Express Scripts, Inc.), Tricare Retail Pharmacy contractor (Express Scripts, Inc.), the Pharmacy Data Transaction Syst em contractor (CSC (Prime) and WebMD(Subktr)), must be prepared to demonstrate that such relationships do not cause an actual or apparent conflict of interest. Contractor participation in more than one of these areas may give rise to an unfair competitive advantage resulting from access to advance acquisition, planning, source selection, or sensitive and/or proprietary information.  Furthermore, contractor partic ipation in more than one area may give rise to a real or apparent loss of contractor impartiality and objectivity; whereas, its advisory or planning assistance in one area potentially affects its present or future participation in another area. At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements of the future RFP, as well as those regarding the nature of the services to be performed under the TRICARE pharmacy auditing services contract, will not be entertained. The competition for the award of the TRICARE pharmacy claims audit services is expected to be conducted under full and open procedures; however, the contracting officer reserves the right to set-aside awards to GSA holders and/or small businesses, if appro priate conditions exist.

<DESC>NOTE: THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE REQUIRES A CAPABILITY RESPONSE IN A SPECIFIC FORMAT BY A SPECIFIC DUE DATE. SEE BELOW FOR DETAILS. THE FORMAT FOR SUBMISSION (ATTACHMENT 1,QUAD CHART) WILL BE PUBLISHED SEPARATELY. 

INTRODUCTION

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Office of Security Technologies (CTO), is sponsoring a Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE 05-A) for explosives detection systems for inspection of break bulk air cargo.  The laboratory and field test for TRE 05-A is scheduled for the 3QFY05 timeframe, and will examine both the effectiveness and suitability of candidate systems.  It is anticipated that additional TRE announcements will be released during the fiscal year and will be standardized, recurring venues for commercial vendors and academic and government laboratories, to have their technologies tested and evaluated in both field and laboratory environments. Future TREs will focus on additional air cargo screening requirements in the following areas: containerized air cargo, palletized air cargo, and mail.

OPERATIONAL FOCUS

The focus of TRE 05-A is to evaluate technologies and systems designed to screen break bulk air cargo for explosive threats.  Air cargo includes, but is not limited to the following: printed matter, electronic equipment, machine parts, wearing apparel, medical supplies, other dry goods, fresh cut flowers, fresh seafood, fresh produce, tropical fish, human remains, and other perishable goods.  


GOAL 

TSA’s goal is to enable a wide variety of potential technologies and systems to be presented for evaluation under the TRE process, and assignments of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) to these systems.  Both automated and non-automated detection devices will be considered for inclusion in the TRE on a space-available basis. 

TECHNOLOGY MATURITY

Technologies and systems at various stages of the maturity may apply under this TRE; however, priority will be given to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) that can be readily deployed to enhance air cargo security.  

RESPONDENT BENEFITS

The TRE 05-A will offer respondents a unique opportunity to obtain effectiveness and suitability data that can be used in their developmental work, regardless of the TRL that they demonstrate.  Further, information obtained through the TRE process may result in future procurement opportunities for detection equipment.  Although the intent of TRE 05-A is to identify promising explosives detection technologies and systems, the TSA is under no obligation to select any of the participating technologies/systems for inclusion in the TRE, nor for future acquisition efforts.  

PROCESS

The process that will be used in the TRE will be a down-select process based on respondent-provided information which is summarized below: This multi-stage down-select process will be used for all respondents and technologies.
  
•	Step One – Respondent Submission of Completed Quad Chart and Review 
Submissions of interest will be requested to submit a more detailed White Paper.
•	Step Two – Government Request for White Paper to Selected Respondents
White Paper requirements will be provided directly to selected respondents and it is anticipated that there will be a short turnaround time required for submission of  the White Paper.
•	Step Three - Respondent Submission of White Paper and Review
Respondents whose White Papers are favorably evaluated will be invited to participate in laboratory and/or field testing. 
•	Step Four – Government Invitation to Participate in the TRE 05-A
Requirements for Step 4 will be provided to those vendors invited to participate in the TRE 05-A. During Step 4 of the TRE process, invited respondents will be required to provide one device at no charge to the government for test purposes, and be required to support, operate and/or train system operators, and maintain the device during the test period.  Respondents will be required to bear all costs associated with shipping the sample to the TRE evaluation site, providing installation support, training, and removal of the sample from the TRE at the end of testing.  The TRE testing process will last for approximately two months (from setup to shutdown).  Test units will be required to be onsite NLT one week prior to test conduct.  TRE test locations for laboratory and/or field testing events are to be determined.  All data/information collected during or in preparation of this TRE will be treated as proprietary. 

REQUIREMENTS 

STEP 1: QUAD CHART SUBMISSION (SEE ATTACHMENT 1)

<SOLNBR>W15QKN-05-X-0310
<RESPDATE>021505
<CONTACT>Michael Gomez, Contract Specialist, (973)724-2368
<DESC>The Office of the Product Manager for Mortar Systems, Precision Effects Branch, is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources of fielded and/or developed munitions for the execution of a 120mm Mortar Family of Extended Range Ammunition (FERA) acquisition program. The weapon platforms for this munition are the US Army’s 120mm Battalion Mortar System (nomenclature M120 and M121), the Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT)– Mortar Carrier (MC) and the Future Combat System (FCS) NLOS- Mortar.  All weapons are smooth bore. The 120mm Battalion Mortar System has been fielded in two configurations: the towed M120 and the carrier mounted M121. The towed M120 is pulled on a carriage behind a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), and also transports mortar ammunition in its cargo bed. The carrier mounted M121 is the same mortar system, but mounted and fired from a tracked vehicle, designated as the M1064/A3 (mortar version of the M113).  The SBCT-MC is a new 120mm platform, managed by the Office of the Project Manager for the Brigade Combat Team.  The NLOS-Mortar is also a new 120mm platform, to be managed by the Office of the Project Manager, Unit of Action.  The NLOS-Mortar will likely be a breech-loaded system as opposed to the other conventional muzzle loaded systems.  Although these two (2) weapon systems may be different from the M120 or M121, they are required to be backwardly compatible. The 120mm Mortar Family of Extended Range Ammunition (FERA) is envisioned to be the Maneuver Commander’s hip pocket, indirect fire munition, capable of providing lethality, obscuration, and illumination effects at extended ranges. The goal of the program is to demonstrate technical maturity, performance characteristics, evaluate and qualify the munition for use by the US Army by the end of USFY10. Systems compatibility requirement is to be able to be fired from the M120, M121, SBCT and NLOS-Mortar. The maximum range requirement when fired from the M120, M121, SBCT, or NLOS-M is 12km (Threshold), 15km (Objective). The munitions shall be ballistically similar cargo carrying rounds, with fuzes that can be manually or automatically set. Charge systems shall be modular, capable of being adjusted manually or automatically. The effects required are anti-personnel, anti-material, illumination (visible and infra-red), obscuration (non-toxic smoke), non-lethal, and practice. The lethality, obscuration, and illumination effects shall at least match the capability of current US ammunition. Improved effects are desired. All sub-munitions (if proposed) must meet the hazardous dud rate of 1.00 percent or better.  A hazardous dud is defined as the main explosive still intact within the sub-munitions, even if detonator has been purged or sterilized.  FERA accuracy requirements are envisioned to exceed current ammunition capabilities to defeat targets, and provide total Circular Error Probable (CEP) (including bias and precision error) that does not exceed 0.55% of range.   The Government is interested only in those potential offerors who have specific knowledge in this subject matter and have experience and the ability, either independently or through responsive outsourcing, to plan for system integration/support, technology advancements and component obsolescence, which will confront the future operational life cycle of this munition. Potential offeror must include ROM pricing for the preceding requirements, to include a ROM per round cost for a first demonstration. Potential offeror must also describe how the design supports a qualification program to field this design by FY10. This is a sources sought notice for planning purposes only. This is not a solicitation and does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement. All responses are requested not later than 15 Febuary 2005, 1630 Hours (Local Time), to: e-mail wgardner@pica.army.mil, or Commander, U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC, ATTN: SFAE-AMO-CAS-MS, Bldg. 162-south, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 Attn: William Gardner.

This year we anticipate maximum participation of two hundred teams. We would like to offer you the opportunity to play a part in this tournament by becoming a commercial sponsor. There are many different package levels to choose from for sponsorship. The package you choose determines the type of recognition you will receive. Some examples of the recognition your company may obtain are a banner hung during the entire tournament, company name and\or logo on the t-shirts, web-page and press release recognition just to name a few. We are also allowing sponsors to set up display tables during the week, which will include registration, the hospitality suite and weigh-in. We are looking for monetary or in-kind sponsorship from companies for trophies, t-shirts, door prizes, large and small, and goody bags. 
If, for some reason, you are unable to become a sponsor at this time you can still be a part of the tournament. Donations (any contributions under $500) are always welcome and will definitely help us to once again have a fist-class tournament. All donors will receive one time recognition on a special banner hung throughout the duration of the tournament.  
Would your company like to be a part of the DOD Team Bass Fishing Tournament for 2005?  If so, please contact Marisa Mammano no later than March 1, 2005 at (478) 926-6629.

The following specification applies to the DC-7 parachute requirement: The parachute canopy shall be 375 square feet to accommodate a payload ranging from 220-300 pounds and be capable of reaching at least 20 miles per hour forward speed.  The parachute shall be capable of achieving descent rates of 0-10 feet per second in no wind conditions using a static deep brake setting. Slotted stabilizer bars are required for good slow speed performance and stability.  A span wise constructed seam is required in order to fit a canopy of this size into the required development bags and containers. The color scheme shall be as follows: (a) Top Skin: 1st span of fabric shall be fire red, the second span of fabric shall be white, the third span of fabric shall be royal blue, the 4th span of fabric shall be royal blue; (b) Bottom Skin: 1st span of fabric shall be fire red, the 2nd span of fabric shall be fire red, the 3rd span of fabric shall be white, the 4th span of fabric shall be royal blue, the 5th span of fabric shall be royal blue; (c) End cells shall be fire red; (d) Ribs shall be fire red; (e) Stabilizers shall be fire red; (f) Slider shall be fire red. The MT-1S reserve parachute is 280 square feet and has a pack volume of 745 cubic inches. This parachute is the only ram-air reserve chute meeting the BLM requirements for fitting the reserve container and meeting all testing requirements of the BLM Smokejumper program.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE ETHERNET TTL COUNTER
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE ETHERNET TTL COUNTER

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's Ethernet TTL Counter invented by scientists at LLNL. 

LLNL’s Ethernet TTL Counter consists of a self-contained, network centric remote sensor. Potential uses of the invention are remote sensing/monitoring/counting. The Ethernet TTL counter incorporates six (6) 16-bit TTL counters with 20ns resolution counting up to 65535 over a configurable gate time. The counts are internally processed and converted to an ASCII data stream sent out via TCP/IP over a configurable, self-contained Ethernet physical layer. The PHY layer, while currently Ethernet, can be changed to 802.11b/g and/or Mesh networks.  Network centric operation allows remote sensing/monitoring. Current units use COTS integrated circuits, however, the entire IP can be software defined and fit onto an FPGA.  An FPGA implementation is preferred for future development.

The Ethernet TTL counter is currently being used to count TTL pulses from He-3 detectors in a neutron counting application. This subsystem is applied in a network based, field-deployable, radiation monitor

LLNL is seeking industrial partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our U.S. licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. LLNL is also looking for collaborative research and development to improve the invention and to explore other usages of the invention. The University of California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory can license technology through exclusive or non-exclusive licensing agreements, as appropriate. All projects are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Ethernet TTL Counter technology should provide a written statement of interest that includes:

1.	Company name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	Description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 98-05

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's subject title.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 is issued to HC104705R4011Reposting to answer questions received.  The proposal due date is also extended to read 12:00 CT, 21 Jan 2005.  Questions/Answers. 1. Q. Will an offer of these capabilities as an ASP (Application Service Provider) service be acceptable?  A. Providing the capabilities that we requested through an Application Service Provider WOULD be an acceptable alternative.   2. Q. In section 3 of the required capabilities, reference is made to support for UDDI V3 capabilities to support categoryBag on bindingTemplates and keyedReferences, yet there is no requirement for UDDI V3 API's. Can you give us some background to the usage and scope of this requirement? A. Whereas we are not requiring total UDDI v3 compliancy, we do require some v3 capabilities.  To allow us to categorize our services to the extent we desire, we do require categoryBag support for bindingTemplates and support for keyedReference groups.  3. Q. In Section 4 of the desired capabilities, reference is made to using Web services Security for authentication and an external authorization policy. Can you give us any information on the external providers that might be used? A. We don't generally target any vendor specific security service providers. We do require any security service vendor to be broadly compliant with current web service security specifications, including (but not limited to) W3C XML dsig, encryption specs and OASIS WSS, SAML and XACML specs. 4. Q. Can you give us some clarification to the scope and design intended by Section 8 of the desired capabilities referencing a globally load-balanced single point of presence?  A. This is to say the product must support a robust and scalable deployment containing support for things such as a load balancer and clustered-deployment.  5. Q. Please explain the relationship and requirements for the UDDI registry with regards to the reference in CLIN0001 to the NCES Core Discovery Service. Can you please provide some detail on the NCES Core Discovery Service that is referenced?  A. The NCES Service Discovery Service (SDS) is an abstraction layer fulfilling the Service Discovery needs. Currently it does so by discovering and publishing services in a UDDI registry.  Using SOA protocols, the service requestor calls the SDS which, in turn, interfaces with the UDDI Registry and performs the requested operations.  6. Q.  Do you require a point-by-point analysis of the product in compliance with the OSD Net-centric checklist, or basic UDDI compliance.  A. No checklist for Net-Centricity is required.  However, the product's compliance with both the required and desired technical capabilities, to include the required subset of UDDI v3 capabilities, must clearly be demonstrated.  A checklist would certainly be an effective way to do this and facilitate the evaluation.  With respect to v2 compliance, a statement of compliance which is clearly demonstrable by included documentation will be sufficient.  7. Q. Can you give us some estimates to the scope, deployment model/timeframe and support requirements for the registry over the life of the contract (# of sites, contacts, users).  A. The SDS UDDI will support both SIPRNet and NIPRNet.  The expected max number of users for each is 300K for SIPRNet and 5300K for NIPRNet.  The number of sites and servers will be part of a deployment strategy that will evolve based on experience and a pilote implementation in the next year.  8. Q.  Since Taxonomy API is not part of the UDDI specifications, are there any identified requirements for this API? A. Taxonomy management implies APIs to create, upload, update/edit, delete and download taxonomies for use in the UDDI registry.  9. Q. Does the request for “unlimited licenses” mean that DISA is requesting the right to install the UDDI software on an unlimited number of computer servers?  World-wide?  Across all DoD computers?  Or only those managed by DISA?  And only within the DISA NCES Program?  A. Only those managed by DISA and within the NCES program.  10. Q. Can you tell us what UDDI software is currently being used?  What company supplies the current UDDI software?  A. The UDDI software currently being used is the Systinet UDDI Registry 4.6.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.  11. Q. Can we use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) http://orca.bpn.gov for this proposal? A. Yes, please use ORCA to submit your reps and certs.  Just indicate in your proposal that you submitted the reps and certs via ORCA and provide your DUNS number so the contracting officer can review.  You must also acknowledge the basic solicitation and amendment 0001 in your proposal.  All other terms and conditions of the original combined solicitation/synopsis remain unchanged.  Email questions and proposals to DISA/DITCO, Linda.Goff@disa.mil.

<DESC>Questions and Responses RFQ #41114 Department of Interior Policy, Management, and Budget Assistant Secretariat If you would like to participate in this acquisition, you will find the solicitation RFQ 41114 documents on the following website:  http://govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp 1.  Question: Are you not looking for a total cost, but rather hourly rates which would then be used for assignments throughout the contract period? Government's Response: The government is looking for discount fixed price labor rates.  Please refer to 52.212- Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items page 6 of 8 and the Government's Statement of Work. 2.  Question: Will the government be awarding only one contract or multiple contracts for various projects under this contract? Government's Response: Those vendors whose proposal results in a successful award will be issued a multiple source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ).  Each ID/IQ holder will be provided a fair opportunity to bid for each task order requirement which may result in each task requirement being competed among all holders of the multiple award ID/IQ. 3.  Question: In reference to the subject solicitation, where can I find more information of the services required and how we can respond (proposal instructions)? I tried accessing more information at the following link but the only thing available is the initial announcement - https://ideasec.nbc.gov/j2ee/announcementdetail.jsp?objId=222426&serverId=MM143501 Government's Response: You may find the entire solicitation package on  http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/scolicit.asp Please continue to scroll down until you located RFQ 41114 - DOI Policy Management Writing Support.  There you may access all documents through the attached links concerning the solicitation.  4.  Question: Could you please tell me what is the due date for responses to RFQ 41114? Government's Response: All questions concerning this RFQ must be received by Tuesday, January 11, 2005 at 10:00 am Eastern Standard Time via email to: robin.doyle@mms.gov.  Questions received after the deadline of Tuesday, January 11, 2005 at 10:00 am Eastern Standard Time will not be accepted.   Technical and Cost proposal are due via email no later than Tuesday, February 1, 2005 at 2pm Eastern Standard Time  to: robin.doyle@mms.gov.  No phone calls concerning this acquisition will be accepted.  All inquiries must be via email, and all questions and responses will be posted to the fedbizopps.gov website as an amendment to the original announcement. 5.  Question:  Does the solicitation package include guidelines for technical costs? Government's Response: Please refer to question 1. 6.  Question:  How soon after the opening bid date would the package be awarded to a contractor? Government's Response: The government must have time to evaluate proposals, and the solicitors office must review the proposals, therefore, an award is anticipated late February, to mid March, 2005. 7.  Question:  Is this contract will identify multiple "approved" vendors, then that each specific project will be assigned to specific vendors as seems appropriate for that project? Government's Response: Yes, this is a multiple vendor award please refer to question #2.   When new tasks arise, each ID/IQ holder will be provided a fair opportunity to bid for each task order requirement which may result in each task requirement being competed among all holders of the multiple award ID/IQ. 8.  Question:  There are three different approached that one might take to the RFQ.  Would the DOI welcome multiple submissions?  Would it be better to suggest multiple approaches in a single submission? Or should a singles solution be best? Government's Response: Yes, you may submit different solutions/proposals to the RFQ.  Be sure to clearly label each of the solutions (i.e. Solution #1, #2, #3, etc.) and address the issues in the Government's Statement of Work.   If the government chooses one the solutions for the award, be prepared to work under that solution.
