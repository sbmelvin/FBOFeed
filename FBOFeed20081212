<p>PLTCE anticipates needing at least four Level 3 EFL Instructors. Each instructor shall provide 33 weeks of EFL instruction services in a one-year period. Each contractor instructor shall conduct EFL instruction for two Program in Advanced Security Studies (PASS) courses and one intensive ESP or English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course.</p>

<p>This acquisition will use a trade-off analysis to make a best value award decision.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   Title: Project to Synthesize Climate Change Impacts and Scope Adaptation Planning and Management Options for the U.S. Southeast
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management, intends to award a purchase order for a project to synthesize climate change impacts and scope adaptation planning and management options for the U.S. Southeast.  The Southeastern United States (defined initially for this project as the eight states of EPA Region 4-Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee) is predicted to experience significant and potentially highly costly climate change impacts.  A window of opportunity exists for these states to "get in front" of the impacts curve, minimizing long-term damage and cost while maximizing welfare for the citizens of the U.S. Southeast.  

The primary purpose of this project is to begin to create the conditions for success for the U.S. Southeast on climate change adaptation, by synthesizing impacts, scoping adaptation planning and management options, and bringing together practitioners and principals to assess and develop these options.  In so doing, adaptation efforts in the Southeast will be greatly aided and the planning and management lessons learned from the project will be available to be applied in other parts of the country.
The scope of work related to this project will involve five distinct phases, with each building upon the phase before it.  These phases are outlined below:
Phase I - A draft background paper will synthesize existing literature on the impacts of climate change on the Southeast.
Phase II - A second draft background paper, informed by the first paper, will analyze and outline the challenges and options for adaptation planning and management in the Southeast.
Phase III - A three-month feedback and planning period, during which the draft background papers will be distributed for comments and suggestions in conjunction with identifying Southeast adaptation principals and practitioners across sectors.  Using this information, a planning process will take place to determine the optimal size, location, and invited participants for a gathering of adaptation principals and practitioners later in the year.  That is, the feedback and comments that are received on the background papers, as well as the information from the identification process, should be used to design the gathering.  At the end of this phase, final background papers, a final agenda for the gathering, and a final list of participants will be developed.
Phase IV - A gathering of principals and practitioners.  The structure of this meeting will be determined based on responses to draft background papers and other discussions, to include assessment and development of options for adaptation planning and management in the Southeast United States.
Phase V - A project summary report will be produced, which will allow both the distribution of the dialogue and lessons learned from the project as well as the informing of potential future efforts like this one across the country.
The Statement of Work (SOW) for this project can be found on the web at http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adm_placement/sapcbd/climate.htm.  A Request for Quotes (RFQ) will also be posted to the same website sometime after 28 December 2008.  All interested firms should visit the above mentioned website to review the statement of work for this project to determine if they are capable of performing the statement of work and to download the RFQ once it is available.
Telephone calls will not be accepted or acknowledged.  All questions should be sent via email to honegger.harold@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, is working with First Air Force-Air Forces Northern (1 AF-AFNORTH), Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, and the 611th Air Communications Squadron (611 ACOMS) at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska (on behalf of PACAF and Eleventh Air Force) to issue a sole source modification to General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), Inc., 77 A Street Needham MA 02494-2806. The proposed modification is a continuation and extension of the work performed by GDIT under contract DCA200-01-D-5006, Air Defense Communications Service (ADCS), which was competitively awarded on 6 July 2001. The ADCS contract provides management, maintenance and repair, and logistics support of the existing highly sophisticated and critical communications systems and subsystems utilized in Command and Control for Airspace Defense and Homeland Defense by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) and the Pacific Area Air Defense of Pacific Air Force (PACAF). These communications systems are installed at operations centers and remote facilities across the Continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii and United States Territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands). ADCS performance includes system improvements, upgrades and modifications that require engineering knowledge and experience. The Air Force standard for system availability is 99.999%. Due to the critical nature of the Air Defense mission, the Government cannot take the risk of loss of service. GDIT is uniquely suited to provide the services due to their in-depth knowledge of the communications equipment and unique communications systems they developed to support the communication portion of the air defense mission. Additionally, GDIT also provides troubleshooting supported by the Captive Off-Line Facility (COLF), redesign of unique communication systems, and software support. GDIT has in place Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) sources to support the existing system hardware and software. GDIT provides system management, engineering and maintenance personnel who are uniquely qualified through years of air defense systems engineering, development, and maintenance experience to ensure the necessary continuity and availability of the ADCS system. This modification will: 1) extend the period of performance of the contract for the period of 01 January 2009 to 31 March 2009; and, 2) include and additional 3-month option period. There is no change to the existing contract ceiling of $115,895,931.24 as a result of this proposed extension. The purpose of the proposed modification is to facilitate the completion of the source selection process for the follow-on requirement, ADCS2. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. See Numbered Note 22. All inquiries regarding the sole source modification shall be submitted electronically and directed to Sally Gettleman, Contract Officer, at sally.gettleman@disa.mil, or Adam Q. Hemken, Contract Specialist, adam.hemken@disa.mil.</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS - This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.The Special Operations Peculiar Modification Kit (SOPMOD) Program managed at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) conducts Research and Development (R&D) directed toward ordnance and electronics, processes, systems, subsystems and components in support of our nation's war fighters.  For Ordnance, the SOPMOD programs primary technical areas include Small Arms, Ordnance, and Optical fire control systems.  The Electronics area includes Displays & Peripherals, Night Vision/Electro-Optics and Laser based fire control systems.  The mission of the Special Operations Peculiar Modification M4A1 Accessory Kit is to provide the M4A1 Carbine and SOF Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) with the flexibility and versatility to adapt basic issue weapons to meet SOF mission-specific requirements.  Because Special Operations Forces lack organic heavy weapons such as tanks and artillery and are limited in capacity to carry or resupply ammunition, success and survival often dep! ends on the effective employment of individual weapons.  Items contained within the SOPMOD Kit enhance the weapon's operational effectiveness through increased target recognition/acquisition, speed of engagement, and accuracy from Close Range Engagements (CRE 0-50m) to the maximum effective range of the weapon (600m) during both day and night conditions.  Within these mission areas the SOPMOD Program is responsible for the full spectrum of R&D, acquisition, and SOF war fighter support.  Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; and development of operational systems.The SOPMOD program management office is interested in receiving concept papers for R&D in all of its mission areas.  Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, non-profit organizations, and institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia comprising such concerns.  The SOPMOD Program encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, HUB Zone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions (HBCUs/MIs).  SOPMOD is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they never have been sold before) and proposals should be for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation rather than focus on a specific system or hardware solution.Interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper").  This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with an executive summary (short paragraph) on the effort, a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and a rough cost estimate.  Offerors should submit the white papers electronically.  Offerors who submit acceptable white papers prior to 5:00 p.m. on 6 January 2009 may be given the opportunity to brief their submittals at the Special Operations Forces Shooters Conference immediately following SHOT Show 2009 on 19-20 January 2009 at Orlando, Florida.  Specific times and places for the briefings will be coordinated through the NSWC Crane SOPMOD Program Office.It should be noted that the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Wexford Group International (WGI), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) and possibly other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government.  At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts.  This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of this announcement.  There is no set date for submission.  The following e-mail point of contact is provided for information regarding technical programs/technologies of interest within the warfare areas supported by the SOPMOD Program and for submission of white papers: Mr. J. Liam Donovan (e-mail: james.l.donovan@navy.mil).  NSWC Crane Contracting Office Point of Contact is Mr. Dennis Ball at 812-854-2129; email dennis.ball@navy.mil.

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-01 for Other than Full and Open Competition and FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The Mission & Installation Contracting Command, Directorate of Contracting, 4118 Susquehanna Avenue, aberdeen MD 21005 has a requirement to procure the following item:   0001 Steel Tank, Size: 32.680' X 16.12inches nonominal sidewall height factory coated bolted carbon steel Test Water Storage Tank, specific gravity of 1.00, nominal capacity 101,146 gallons, usable capacity 98,009 gallons based on 0.500 of freeboard, designed in accordance with AWWA D 103-97 Specifications, Seismic Zone 1, 1=1.25, Rw=3.50, S=1.50 per AWWA, 1.00 MPH wind load per AWWA, Flat steel bottom, Opemn top girder.  COATINGS:  Interior mill finish.  Exterior painted one coat of Trico Bond EP thermset corrosion resistant powder epoxy with finish coat of Standard Tan Performance urethane (4.5 mils average, DFT).  Coatings are electrostatically applied over a minimum SSPC-SP 0 near-white blast and thermally cured.  CCT coatings are applied within a controlled environment and blast is achieved using a steel grit and shot mix. HARDWARE:  Galvanized bolts, nuts, washers, and EPDM gasketin.  Plastic encapsulated head bolts for interior vertical seams.  INSTALLATION on Governments prepared grade level and accessible foundation.  DELIVERY:  12 weeks after receipt of approved drawings and detail.  In order to continue testing for the SSM 1/2 Scale Model Program sponsored by the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD), the US Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) requires one 32 diameter by 16 high steel tank built and sold by Columbian TecTank Co. This tank is required to complete a long series of tests already performed at ATC for NSWCCD using the steel bolted water tanks built and sold by Columbian TecTank Co. NSWCCD requires the data for the tests to be repeatable, thus they require this item in order to have consistency in their tests and repeat all established baseline data. Another water tank would violate the consistency of their tests. This water tank allows for assembly of the bottom to be performed in sections, which is required for this test. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other will satisfy the agency requirements.  The Government intents to award a sole source contract to Columbian TecTank, 5400 Kansas Avenue, Kansas city KS 66110-2907.  This firm is the sole manufacturer/distributor of this product.  Efforts to solicit other contractors are being made via this announcement in accordance with FAR 5.2.

All responses received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement not later than 2:00 PM EDT, Friday December 19, 2008. any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.

Statement of Work
As part of its financial statement process, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is required to estimate and record its Accounts Payable (AP) liability.  The BIA calculates the estimate based on a statistical review of payments.  The statistical selection and projection service is provided by an outside contractor.  In providing this service, the Contractor will provide all materials, labor and equipment to provide a sampling plan that yields the smallest sample possible while covering the entire population.  The sampling approach and resulting projection must satisfy the audit requirements conducted by the BIAs external auditors.
BIA will accrue a liability amount for FY 2009 based on a three-year historical analysis of actual invoices processed in the accounting system reflecting an invoice date within the first three months of the respective fiscal year.  These invoices are examined to determine which FY the goods and services were received.  For example, invoices dated from 10/1/07 to 12/31/07 may represent liabilities for FY 2007 or FY 2008 but were not paid until FY 2008 or later.  In previous years, BIA has worked in conjunction with a Contractor to establish an accepted methodology relating to the AP accrual (see attached methodology).  This statement of work defines the work required to build upon the three year trend by sampling the most current fiscal year and combining the results into the methodology.  This work involved shall proceed as follows:
	The Contractor will be supplied with an electronic file of payments made during FY 2008 no later than January 30th 2009.  Within seven calendar days of receiving the electronic file the Contractor must provide BIA with the stratified sample as consistent with the methodology used in the FY 2007 sample.
	BIA will then pull the sampled items and review them to determine which fiscal year the goods and services belong.  Results of the BIA review will be submitted to the Contractor no later than noon on March 20th, 2009. The contractor must then merge this data with the data produced in the FY 2008 accrual process to assimilate a complete three fiscal year analysis, culminating with a final projection that will be used in the FY 2009 accrual.  These projection results are due from the Contractor within seven calendar days (e.g., if BIA provides results on 3/20 then the Contractor must provide the projection number by 4PM on 3/27).
	The Contractor must provide a written report describing the sampling approach and results of analysis within seven calendar days after delivering the projected number/error rate.  For example, written report is due 4PM on 4/3 after delivery of AP projected number on 3/27.  The written report must concisely explain methodology, scope and conclusions to allow for subsequent review by BIA management and its external auditors.  Example of a written report, if desired, must be requested by December 23, 2008, and will be provided via fax or email.
Unless specified otherwise, BIA will send all data files and results of its review to the Contractor electronically via email, FTP, or on CD-rom via overnight mail by 12PM EST of stated deadlines.  All deliverables due from the Contractor must be received by 4PM EST of stated deadlines and must be submitted in soft copies such as Microsoft Excel or Word.
During periods of calculation or following the projection the Contractor shall be available for telephone consultation by BIA staff to include Staff Accountant(s) as well as the Chief of the Financial Reporting and Analysis Division.  These communication sessions may be used to discuss preliminary results, discuss procedural questions, or to provide progress updates.
During the period of the audit (March  November 15), BIA reserves the right to contact the Contractor to address audit inquiries with respect to the accrual process and sampling methodology.  The communication session(s) may involve the external auditors to enable the Contractor to address questions directly.  Subsequently, there may be follow-up questions interspersed throughout the audit process and the Contractor shall be available for telephone consultation.
Not to exceed two (2) face-to-face meetings may be requested and would be held at Reston, VA.  The purpose of these meetings would be to discuss the accrual process and/or results and to answer/debrief any questions BIA and its external auditors might have.  BIA will provide a minimum of seven calendar days notice regarding the meeting date(s) to allow for travel arraignment by the Contractor.  BIA will reimburse the Contractor for his out-of-pocket travel cost associated with this engagement if such travel should be requested.
Except for the out-of-pocket travel costs related to the face-to-face meeting, the Contractor will provide all materials and labor to perform this task at off site.    The period of performance will start upon the final signing of this statement.
II. Supporting Information 
A.	Place of Performance.  Performance is not required to take place at the BIA 
B.	Period of Performance:  The base period of performance shall be for 1 year from the date of award.  There will be 4 one-year option periods. 
C.	Government-Furnished Property:  The contractor is responsible for their own computer and a means to accept large data files.  The BIA will provide the contractor with an explanation of document numbering scheme and transaction types to determine payments, bankcard, travel and undelivered orders. 
D.	Key qualifications:  The contractor should be able to provide professional statistical design, analysis and modeling for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Division of Financial Reporting and Analysis, and Office of Acquisitions and Property.  The contractor should have knowledge of governmental accounting and financial statement reporting.
E.	Travel.  Expenses will be reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation rates.  Any travel will be in compliance with the Joint Travel Regulations.
F.	Any additional requirements within the scope of the contract will be accommodated through the use of contract modifications.

<DESC>Federal Business Opportunities Announcement

The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate with vendors on an open competition basis to procure a CAT 6 Upgrade for the NOSTRA facility in VA.  Interested parties shall attend a walk through on 19 December 2008 at 11:00 a.m. EST if possible, and if not 22 December 2008 at 8:00 a.m. Submit a proposal and technical documentation within 10 business days.  The technical documentation will be compared to the essential minimum salient characteristics and the evaluation factors listed below.  

Salient Characteristics:  

1. NOSTRA would like to have the current CAT 3, 5, & 5e network cable, throughout the 41,000 sq.ft. building replaced with CAT 6 cabling including the upgrade of existing switch cabinets.  The recently installed CAT 6 will remain in place and untouched by the contractor unless otherwise specifically asked by NOSTRA.
2. NOSTRA expects the contractor to take all steps necessary to minimize those inconveniences to all NOSTRA employees.
3. All cabling shall be installed in a manner of which visual sight of the cabling will be minimal.  If keeping the cable from being seen visually is not feasible, then the contractor should make every effort to install the cable in such a manner that it be as visually aesthetic as possible.
4. NOSTRA is seeking the ability to communicate throughout the Local Area Network at a minimum of speed of 1Gbps.
5. The contractor shall include descriptions of any previously completed work similar in size and scope of work, to demonstrate expertise.
6. The contractor shall pull, terminate, test, and certify Yellow CAT 6 cabling rated for at least 550Mhz.
7. Priority will be given to using power poles that are already provided and where necessary contractor will provide any additional power poles, locking channel conduit, and surface raceways.
8. Contractor will remove and properly dispose of existing CAT 3, 5, & 5e cabling and switches to include the patch panel inside current secure area.  This will be done in accordance with state and federal regulations once CAT 6 cabling is installed and employees are no longer connected to and using old cabling.  The objective is to provide for minimum impact on NOSTRA employees by having the CAT 6 cabling installed along side the existing cabling and switched over to the CAT 6 cabling before the old cabling is removed.
9. Installation of CAT 6 patch panel for drops plus patch cables from patch panel to switch.
10. Patch cables will consist of varying lengths from the patch panels to the switches.  The contractor shall use cable management techniques to provide for a neat fit and finish appearance.
11. The new and old cables must be secured, labeled and organized in such a way that their identity could be easily determined by NOSTRA staff to include recently installed CAT6.
12. All drops shall use CAT 6 compliant jacks.
13. Cabling routed through plenum areas must be plenum compliant and jacketed with low-smoke PVC.
14. All additional components should be mounted to fit and provide a clean fit and finish to the whole project.
15. Evaluation Criteria: The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate with vendors on an open competition basis for a CAT 6 upgrade for NOSTRA.  Technical proposals must include sufficiently detailed information to enable evaluation based on four (4) factors listed below in order of decreasing priority:
1.) Equipment Factors; Conformance to Essential Characteristics and Standardization;
2.) Human Factors; a.) Simplicity; b.) Ease of Use;

<p><br />a. BASIS FOR AWARD:</p>
<p>&bull; This will be a best value award conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, 13.5 and Part 15 as applicable. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards by contract line items for a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). The award will encompass the entire Statement of Objective for the BPA. No partial awards will be made. Offerors must propose to perform all task areas in the Statement of Objective, Attachment A. In addition, the offeror must propose to perform all tasks in Regional 1, 2 and 3, Attachment B. In addition to awarding the BPA, awards to all three (3) Regional tasks shall be issued at the same time. <br />&bull; A BPA will be awarded to the offeror(s) deemed responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the Solicitation's requirements and is judged to represent the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>&bull; FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />The above stated FAR Clause is applicable to this evaluation process. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p><br />- Offeror's technical approach which includes an assessment of the offeror's understanding of the requirement, the offeror's approach to understanding the requirement and qualifications of the proposed personnel and the Offeror's ability to meet schedule requirements<br />- The quality of the offeror's recent and relevant past performance <br />- Price</p>
<p><br />The evaluation criteria above are listed in descending order of importance. When combined, the technical approach and past performance are significantly more important than price. As non-priced factors reach equality, price becomes a significant factor.<br />Years: The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all years (Attachment C) to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the year prices are significantly unbalanced.</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>&bull; The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed necessary.<br /><br />&bull; Past Performance: Offeror must ensure three (3) Past Performance References are submitted as described above. Past Performance shall be received by the submission date of proposals. Past Performance references must be emailed as stated above. Past performance assessments, however not all encompassing, will be evaluated in the areas of :</p>
<p>&#61692; Quality of Work<br />&#61692; Personnel<br />&#61692; Business Relations<br />&#61692; Timeliness of Performance<br />&#61692; Customer Satisfaction</p>
<p>b. EVALUATION APPROACH:</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate and execute Regional 1, 2 and 3, Attachment B as BPA Orders and use the offeror's proposal as a means of evaluating the offeror's ability to satisfy the requirement of this Order, in terms of the technical approach in conjunction with past performance, and pricing submission to determine the award of the BPA. The best value will represent the offeror that demonstrates the ability to provide the best proposal to the Order, considering the offerors' understanding of the project and the offeror's approach to satisfy the requirements, and qualifications of the personnel proposed to satisfy the Order, ability to satisfy the schedule and deliverable requirements, past performance as it relates to the Order and price. Price will include the reasonableness of the price and locality adjustment factor(s). The Government may award to other than the highest rated offeror when the price proposed by this offeror for the tasks is determined to be unaffordable.</p>

<RESPDATE>122908
<CONTACT>MaShonda R Smith, Phone 202-418-0933, Fax 202-418-0237, Email mashonda.smith@fcc.gov
<DESC>This synopsis is for the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) Consumer Complaint Processing Services requirement.  This synopsis is prepared in accordance with FAR part(s) 6.302 -1, Only one responsible source.  This synopsis gives notice of the Governments intent to negotiate and issue a sole source purchase order in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The Commission currently manages two (2) separate and distinct information technology infrastructure support purchase orders:  the Consumer Complaint Processing Services purchase order #PUR07000445 and the IT Infrastructure Support Services purchase order #PUR07000406.  This dual purchase order structure has created redundancy and overlap inefficiencies in conducting IT infrastructure support across the Commission.  In order to improve the cost-effectiveness of our IT infrastructure and to support our IT infrastructure strategic objectives, the FCC will consolidate the Consumer Complaint Processing Services into the IT Infrastructure Support Services purchase order #PUR07000406.  The Consumer Complaint Processing Services are necessary and directly related to the FCCs IT Infrastructure Support Services.  This requirement obligates the contractor, Ambit Group, LLC located at 1895 Preston White Drive, Suite 220, Reston, VA  20191-5434, a Service Disabled Veteran and Woman Owned Small Business (SDVWOSB) to add three (3) Business Analyst and one (1) Technical Analyst to purchase order #PUR07000406.  The Government intends to award a sole source purchase order to Ambit Group, LLC.   Ambit Group, LLC has been providing the critical, highly specialized services described above to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) since September 1, 2007.  The existing purchase order is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2008.  There is no transition period necessary upon award to Ambit Group, LLC.  Due to the considerable transition period anticipated upon a new purchase order award, the FCC has determined that only one contractor, Ambit Group, LLC, is capable of meeting the critical need(s) for uninterrupted continuation of the Consumer Complaint Processing Services for a period of performance covering purchase order #PUR07000406.  Accordingly, award to any other source other than Ambit Group, LLC would result in an unacceptable interruption in fulfilling the FCCs mission and requirements and could severely jeopardize the success of continuing to meet the mission and goals of the requirement.  While it may be technically possible for other companies to provide the required services after a considerable transition period, the FCC believes that no contractor other than Ambit Group, LLC is capable of providing services beginning January 1, 2009 until purchase order #PUR07000406 is recompeted.  FCC Consumer Complaint Services must continue to be provided without interruption.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by addressing how it would be able to perform the interim services from January 1, 2009 until the recompetition is issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   However, all capability statements received within 15 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the FCC.  A determination by the FCC not to compete this proposed purchase order action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the FCC.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested vendors must contact Ms. Smith, Senior Contract Specialist, FCC/Contracts & Purchasing Center, @ 202-418-0933 or via email @ mashonda.smith@fcc.gov.

ADDENDUM

A. GENERAL. 

This Performance Work Statement describes the technical services necessary to support the Engineering Services Division (ESD), United States Coast Guard (USCG) Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Aviation Training Center (ATC) Mobile, Alabama, and USCG Headquarters (CGHQ).

B. SCOPE OF WORK.

The Contractor shall provide the services of trained and experienced personnel as listed in Section C Requirements. 

C. REQUIREMENTS

C-1 SCOPE:

A requirement exists for technical support services in Engineering Services Division (ESD), U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center (ALC).  These services include:

1.	(1) Production Control Clerk 			Tech Pubs Branch
2.	(1) General Clerk IV				Tech Pubs Branch 
3.	(1) General Clerk I 				Tech Pubs Branch 
4.	(1) Photo Finishing Worker			IOD
5.	(1) Data Management Administrator		Aging Aircraft Branch 

C-1.1. Background:

C-1.1.1. Production Control Clerk:  The Technical Publications Cell, ESD, ALC, has the responsibility for publishing, updating and distributing Coast Guard aircraft technical documentation.  A requirement exists to maintain publication inventory, facilitate shipping, and to maintain specified records.  

C-1.1.2. General Clerk IV/I:  The Engineering Services Division (ESD), U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), has the responsibility to provide the most current technical publications to all U.S. Coast Guard aviation units. Preparation and systematic review of documents for printing, corrections, distribution and general use by the Coast Guard are needed in order to provide timely and accurate maintenance data to the Coast Guard.

C-1.1.3. Photo Finishing Worker (1): The contractor will be assigned to the Policy & QA Cell, ESD.  The contractors primary function will be to assist the Aviation Photographer in his photographic support of ALC and other activities as required.

C-1.1.4. Data Management Administrator:  The Aging Aircraft Branch located at the Aviation Logistics Center within the Engineering Services Division has embarked on an aggressive program and lacks the necessary resources to document current and future endeavors for submission into existing procedures and publications.  The existing corrosion-mapping program is in its infancy stage and has significant potential growth when properly staffed for success.  With the advent of a dedicated Technical Administrator to work closely with all the Cell Managers and CPAs at the Product Line and sweeping changes can be implemented.   Current staffing does not permit the necessary rapid changes based on findings that can significantly reduce or mitigate corrosion.  Through the submission of reviewed MPC CG-22 changes for the individual airframes coupled with the information collected from all AAB programs revised maintenance practices can be more swiftly implemented.  Technical Administrator serves as assistant to NDI Program Manager for maintenance of training records and certifications of Coast Guard wide personnel participating in Aviation NDI program.		
C-1.2. Government Furnished Property:

C-1.2.1.  ALC will provide workspace, tools, computer hardware and software (including computer-related equipment necessary for specific tasks), furniture, consumables, use of Coast Guard Master Technical Library, and all necessary administrative support for services provided under that statement of work.

C-1.3. Location of Work:

C-1.3.1 The majority of the work specified in this statement of work shall be performed at USCG ALC, Elizabeth City, N.C.  

C-2. APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:

EVALUATION  COMMERCIAL ITEMS

As prescribed in 12.301(c),
FAR  52.212-2  EVALUATIONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS. (JAN 1999) 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 


	Request for Quotations (RFQ) will be evaluated against the requirements listed in 	the Performance Work Statement. IAW FAR 13.004(a), a quotation is not an 	offer and consequently cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding 	contract. All responses received as a result of this solicitation will be evaluated 	and the contract file be documented accordingly. All responses received as a 	result of this solicitation will be evaluated and the contract file be documented 	accordingly.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract 	without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in 	FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the 	offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The evaluation 	factor for award of this requirement will be based on lowest price technically 	acceptable obtained from a responsible offeror.The Government reserves the right 	to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be 	necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors.  

	Technical Conformance 

	The technical evaluation will be on the basis of information furnished by the 	offeror to include examination of the employee certifications, clearances, and 	resumes submitted with the requirements of the Performance Work Statement and 	reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.


	Past Performance

	Offers shall provide at least two (2) references and include recent and relevant 	contracts including contract numbers, points of contract with telephone numbers 	and other relevant information.  For this factor the Government will evaluate 	information obtained from past performance information that the Government 	obtains about the offeror from other sources.  Failure to address this requirement 	can result in failure of this evaluation factor.

	Price

	Proposals shall be inclusive of the supplies and service descriptions CLIN 1  	through 5.


IAW FAR 15.304, Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important in relative importance of all other evaluation factors when compared to price. 

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 
(End of provision)

	(3) 0 Are, 0  are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
	(4) 0  Have, 0 have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
		(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
			(A) The tax liability is finally determined.  The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.  A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.  In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
			(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.  A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.  A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
		(ii) Examples.  (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.  This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.  Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
			(B)  The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing.  In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.  This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.  Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
			(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159.  The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.  The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
			(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.  The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except
that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for
`at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the
properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the
properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is

corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former
partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in
the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not
have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of
which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of
such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted
domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity
as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining
ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign
incorporated entity; or
 (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C.
395(b)(1).

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or
indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership
during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership
requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a
plan.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by
contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a
principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the
Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership,
except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common
control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>Federal Business Opportunities Announcement

The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate with vendors on an open competition basis to procure a CAT 6 Upgrade for the NOSTRA facility in VA.  Interested parties shall attend a walk through on 19 December 2008 at 11:00 a.m. EST Submit a proposal and technical documentation within 10 business days.  The technical documentation will be compared to the essential minimum salient characteristics and the evaluation factors listed below.  

Salient Characteristics:  

1. NOSTRA would like to have the current CAT 3, 5, & 5e network cable, throughout the 41,000 sq.ft. building replaced with CAT 6 cabling including the upgrade of existing switch cabinets.  The recently installed CAT 6 will remain in place and untouched by the contractor unless otherwise specifically asked by NOSTRA.
2. NOSTRA expects the contractor to take all steps necessary to minimize those inconveniences to all NOSTRA employees.
3. All cabling shall be installed in a manner of which visual sight of the cabling will be minimal.  If keeping the cable from being seen visually is not feasible, then the contractor should make every effort to install the cable in such a manner that it be as visually aesthetic as possible.
4. NOSTRA is seeking the ability to communicate throughout the Local Area Network at a minimum of speed of 1Gbps.
5. The contractor shall include descriptions of any previously completed work similar in size and scope of work, to demonstrate expertise.
6. The contractor shall pull, terminate, test, and certify Yellow CAT 6 cabling rated for at least 550Mhz.
7. Priority will be given to using power poles that are already provided and where necessary contractor will provide any additional power poles, locking channel conduit, and surface raceways.
8. Contractor will remove and properly dispose of existing CAT 3, 5, & 5e cabling and switches to include the patch panel inside current secure area.  This will be done in accordance with state and federal regulations once CAT 6 cabling is installed and employees are no longer connected to and using old cabling.  The objective is to provide for minimum impact on NOSTRA employees by having the CAT 6 cabling installed along side the existing cabling and switched over to the CAT 6 cabling before the old cabling is removed.
9. Installation of CAT 6 patch panel for drops plus patch cables from patch panel to switch.
10. Patch cables will consist of varying lengths from the patch panels to the switches.  The contractor shall use cable management techniques to provide for a neat fit and finish appearance.
11. The new and old cables must be secured, labeled and organized in such a way that their identity could be easily determined by NOSTRA staff to include recently installed CAT6.
12. All drops shall use CAT 6 compliant jacks.
13. Cabling routed through plenum areas must be plenum compliant and jacketed with low-smoke PVC.
14. All additional components should be mounted to fit and provide a clean fit and finish to the whole project.
15. Evaluation Criteria: The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate with vendors on an open competition basis for a CAT 6 upgrade for NOSTRA.  Technical proposals must include sufficiently detailed information to enable evaluation based on four (4) factors listed below in order of decreasing priority:
1.) Equipment Factors; Conformance to Essential Characteristics and Standardization;
2.) Human Factors; a.) Simplicity; b.) Ease of Use;
3.) Quality; a.) Warranty; b.) Parts Availability; c.) Parts Cost; d.) Serviceability
4.) Instruction Materials; a.) Operators Manual; b.) Maintenance Manual

4.) Instruction Materials; a.) Operators Manual; b.) Maintenance Manual

Regulatory Requirements:  Emphasis should be made to make sure that the installation complies with all industry standards, and any and all regulations both state and federal.
 
Essential Characteristics
CAT 6 System Installation/Upgrade

1. NOSTRA would like to have the current CAT 3, 5, & 5e network cable, throughout the 41,000 sq.ft. building replaced with CAT 6 cabling including the upgrade of existing switch cabinets.  The recently installed CAT 6 will remain in place and untouched by the contractor unless otherwise specifically asked by NOSTRA.
2. NOSTRA expects the contractor to take all steps necessary to minimize those inconveniences to all NOSTRA employees.
3. All cabling shall be installed in a manner of which visual sight of the cabling will be minimal.  If keeping the cable from being seen visually is not feasible, then the contractor should make every effort to install the cable in such a manner that it be as visually aesthetic as possible.
4. NOSTRA is seeking the ability to communicate throughout the Local Area Network at a minimum of speed of 1Gbps.
5. The contractor shall include descriptions of any previously completed work similar in size and scope of work, to demonstrate expertise.
6. The contractor shall pull, terminate, test, and certify Yellow CAT 6 cabling rated for at least 550Mhz.
7. Priority will be given to using power poles that are already provided and where necessary contractor will provide any additional power poles, locking channel conduit, and surface raceways.
8. Contractor will remove and properly dispose of existing CAT 3, 5, & 5e cabling and switches to include the patch panel inside current secure area.  This will be done in accordance with state and federal regulations once CAT 6 cabling is installed and employees are no longer connected to and using old cabling.  The objective is to provide for minimum impact on NOSTRA employees by having the CAT 6 cabling installed along side the existing cabling and switched over to the CAT 6 cabling before the old cabling is removed.
9. Installation of CAT 6 patch panel for drops plus patch cables from patch panel to switch.
10. Patch cables will consist of varying lengths from the patch panels to the switches.  The contractor shall use cable management techniques to provide for a neat fit and finish appearance.
11. The new and old cables must be secured, labeled and organized in such a way that their identity could be easily determined by NOSTRA staff to include recently installed CAT6.
12. All drops shall use CAT 6 compliant jacks.
13. Cabling routed through plenum areas must be plenum compliant and jacketed with low-smoke PVC.
14. All additional components should be mounted to fit and provide a clean fit and finish to the whole project.
15. Evaluation Criteria: The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate with vendors on an open competition basis for a CAT 6 upgrade for NOSTRA.  Technical proposals must include sufficiently detailed information to enable evaluation based on four (4) factors listed below in order of decreasing priority:
1.) Equipment Factors; Conformance to Essential Characteristics and Standardization;

<DESC><p><strong>PLEASE NOTE THE RESPONSE DUE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED&nbsp;TO 12 PM (NOON) PACIFIC DAYLIGHT TIME,&nbsp;FRIDAY, DECEMBER 26, 2008.</strong></p>
<p>INTRODUCTION
<p>The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle) for the United States Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking information from companies, educational institutions, research and development laboratories (public and private), or other sources about commercially available systems, government available or near-commercial technologies that may be used for Emergency Management Systems (EMS), Incident Management Systems (IMS), Command and Control Systems (C2S), Consequence Management Systems (CMS), and Decision Support Systems (DSS) related to EMS, IMS, or C2S.<br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is part of an overall strategy to identify the next generation of decision support systems for fielding by Department of Defense (DoD) installations both now and in the three to five year time frame. The information obtained by this sources sought will be included in a market study that will be coupled with a hands-on evaluation to identify which system or systems should be considered by the client for fielding.</p>
<p>PNNL is assessing the market to gain information about commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS) and near commercial software products for potential use at installations world-wide supporting installation protection. Information about the software's ability to support local emergency response forces (military and civilian medical, fire, security forces, civil engineering, etc.) ease of use, and compatibly with existing systems will be considered. Reliability, availability and maintainability are also of interest as is compatibility with DoD standards and architectures.</p>
<p>The following capabilities, in a non-prioritized order, are of specific interest to PNNL:<br />- provide situational awareness; <br />- Geographic Information System (GIS); <br />- locate crash, spill, fire, flood, accident, attacks; <br />- accept inputs from first responders; <br />- track and display resources applicable to emergency management; <br />- generate optimal routes; <br />- determine evacuation routes; <br />- provide notification and evacuation status; <br />- track emergency responder vehicle locations; <br />- model and plot potential hazards; <br />- link facility floor plans to layout maps; <br />- provide weather information; <br />- create control points;<br />- utilize chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or explosive (CBRNE) sensor locations, data, and alarms; <br />- provide security alarm locations and status; <br />- track and display assets, casualty locations, collection areas, and restricted areas; <br />- provide 3D visualization; <br />- generate checklists and incident reports; <br />- and support roles and policy management.</p>
<p>This RFI is divided into two parts. Part 1 includes specific requirements that must be met for candidate components to be considered for near term deployment. Part 2 is a much more open-ended request, through which the purpose is to identify promising technology of many kinds that, with additional maturation or other assistance, could be considered for deployment later in the program cycle.</p>
<p>PART 1 - REQUIREMENTS OF SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS FOR NEAR TERM UTILIZATION</p>
<p>This section of the RFI identifies requirements which must be met by candidate components if they are to be considered for near term deployment.</p>
<p>The deployment program includes a Family of Systems (FoS) used to perform a host of integrated functions. FoS components must meet criteria based on PM IPP Operational Test Concept Plan (OTCP) and operational requirements. Any component system of the FoS that connects to any DoD network must be accredited through the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) process, or the DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation (DITSCAP) process as appropriate, and ultimately be capable of receiving an Authority to Operate (ATO). COTS and GOTS responders should indicate which of their offerings are accredited through DIACAP or DITSCAP and which now have an ATO. Systems should be designed and developed with consideration given to the general and specific, mandatory and guidance documents that impact DoD programs of record. Systems will be evaluated for evidence of such consideration in the areas of architecture, data standards and formats, information assurance, and Net-Centric Services Strategy. A current ATO is evidence of such consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Open Architecture Design for the CBRN Installation Protection Program</strong></p>
<p>Open architecture solutions for the DSS architecture are required for an integrated CBRN protection and response system. Legacy sensors may be present and require integration into the DSS architecture (Portal Shield, Joint Biological Point Detection System).</p>
<p><strong>Information Management Integration</strong></p>
<p>The DSS is a central element of installation solutions. The DSS shall facilitate rapid and effective decision making, enhancing operational control and response, conducting downwind hazard prediction and facilitating rapid and effective warning and notification. Systems will be evaluated for compatible with Global Information Grid Enterprise Services (GIG ES) and Net Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) capabilities. COTS and GOTS responders to this RFI should identify which of their candidate offerings are compatible with and utilize GIG ES and NCES capabilities.</p>
<p>The DSS shall include appropriate commercial based emergency response software capabilities to ensure interoperability with state and local responders and shall permit installation specific tailoring to accommodate the specific installation map and procedures or reporting requirements unique to that installation. The DSS must be capable of integrating current and future CBRN analysis and hazard prediction models such as Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN), with commercial emergency response, management tools and systems, and fixed CBRN sensors. COTS and GOTS responders to this RFI should identify which of their candidate offerings provide interoperability with commercial based emergency response software, installation specific tailoring for maps, procedures, and reporting requirements, and support integration of current and future CBRN analysis and hazard prediction models.</p>
<p>PART 2 - INFORMATION SOUGHT FOR FUTURE EVOLUTION OF THE DSS</p>
<p>PNNL is requesting detailed product literature, to assist in determining the capability of software against specific requirements and future needs. Software vendors are invited to participate initially by providing information about their products. Based on the information provided and market research, selected vendors will be given the opportunity to continue in the assessment process by demonstrating capabilities of their software offering or components as needed to perform a more in-depth assessment of functional capabilities. <br />Other evaluation criteria include product maturity, interoperability with other systems and data; maintainability, expandability, standards compliance, certification or evaluation by external bodies, training support, and system costs.</p>
<p>The goal of the assessment is to identify new capabilities and evaluate existing COTS, GOTS and near commercial products against specific functional requirements and future needs. These requirements and scenarios are derived from real-world needs, usability standards, and human factors. A document detailing the specific needs, related standards and human factors will be available upon request.</p>
<p>NOTICES AND INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>Please note that this is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This is NOT a request for proposal and there is no solicitation package available at this time. Participation does not imply any obligation by Battelle, PNNL, DOE or the United States Government or any agency thereof.</p>
<p>Proprietary information will be protected to the greatest extent provided by law. We will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will we compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided. We will also not pay for any demonstration nor compensate any respondent for any costs incurred with development or performance of a demonstration that may be requested.</p>
<p>Interested organizations/companies/institutions are encouraged to respond to this notice by providing product literature and/or other information, no longer than twenty pages, <strong>by 12 PM (Noon) Pacific Daylight Time, Friday, December 26, 2008</strong>.
