<DESC>Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB) Broad Agency Announcement FY06

A.         THIS IS A BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA AWB 06-0001) FOR AIR WARFARE BATTLELAB OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006
(1 October 2005 through 30 September 2006).

B.         INTRODUCTION 

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB) invites concept papers with preliminary cost estimates on innovative Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) and Combat Air Forces (CAF) concepts.     This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraphs 35.016 and 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.     Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984".     Concept papers in response to this announcement shall be submitted to 366 CONS/LGCA2, marked for BAA AWB-06-0001, 366 Gunfighter Ave, Bldg 512 Suite 498, Attn: Mrs. Karen Campbell, Mountain Home AFB ID 83648.     Electronic submission of concept papers may be made to karen.campbell@mountainhome.af.mil by attaching the document to e-mail.     Responses should reference the above BAA number and provide telephone and email contact information.     This announcement is open and effective until 30 SEP 06.     Concept papers in response to this announcement may be submitted at any time during this period.     There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic and offerors should be on the alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.     Additionally, this BAA and all amendments and information related to this announcement will be posted electronically on the INTERNET at: http://www.mountainhome.af.mil/AWB and to the Federal Business Opportunities at http://fbo.gov . 

C.         OBJECTIVE

(1) Technical Description: 

The mission of the Air Warfare Battlelab is to rapidly identify and prove the worth of innovative ideas for enhancing the deployability, sustainability, survivability, and lethality of contingency Air Expeditionary Forces for Global Engagement.     

It is focused in two areas: combat air forces and agile combat support.  Areas of concern include but are not limited to:  aircraft maintenance, ground support equipment, civil engineering projects, medical, intelligence gathering/distribution, bombs on target, munitions, air-to-ground operations, personnel recovery, communications, and supply.   

This BAA requests concept papers to identify material and non-materiel solutions to make our combat expeditionary forces lighter, leaner and more lethal.     

Concepts should directly benefit deployed expeditionary forces, although the entire cradle-to-grave continuum of warfare should be considered.     

The proposed concept will be based on the demonstration of COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE  TECHNOLOGY.

All responses to this BAA will be evaluated for applicability to the aforementioned need.         

Should an offeror submit a concept that is better aligned with the needs of another Battlelab or requiring activity, the Air Warfare Battlelab will send written notice of this fact with reference to the appropriate activity. 

D.         ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Potential offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference number BAA AWB 06-0001 with their submissions. Potential offerors are required to register their company information at www.ccr.gov before any contracts can be awarded to that company.     Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply.     Notice to Foreign Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Air Force point of contact, Mrs. Karen Campbell at (208) 828-3100 or email to: karen.campbell@mountainhome.af.mil upon deciding to respond to this announcement.     Foreign contractors shall be aware that restrictions may apply which could preclude their participation in this program.

E.         CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS 

The cost of preparing concept papers in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost IAW FAR 31.205-18.     Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the concept paper and any evaluations.     The submitter must mark the concept paper with a protective legend IAW FAR 52.215-1(e) and FAR 3.104-4.     Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or proposals are not desired.     Offerors are strongly encouraged to submit concept papers, not to exceed five (5) pages, to the electronic addresses listed in section A of this announcement.     However, if you do not have the capability of transmitting the concept paper electronically, submit three (3) copies, not to exceed 5 pages, of the proposed concept to Mrs. Campbell at the address in Section A of this BAA.     The concept paper shall be formatted as follows: 

Section A: Title, Submitter, Date, E-Mail Account, Phone#, Fax #, Organization/Office Symbol, Address; Period of Performance, Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost of effort. 

Section B: Problem Statement, Need Statement or Operational Impact statement which concisely summarizes how the product of the demonstration will enhance Air Force AEF and/or CAF operations.

Section C: Proposed Solution summarizing innovative concept and use of commercial or non-developmental items (NDI) to accomplish the demonstration.

Section D: Proposed Concept Demonstration concisely describing the demonstration and execution methodology. 

Section E: Support Components required for the demonstration to include hardware, software, data, facilities and training.

Section F: Expected Results, Benefits or Product of the demonstration. 

Section G: Proposed AF and DoD operational users of the concept; and 

Section H: Identify similar contracts to include the point of contact’s current telephone # and address.     For papers marked proprietary, the offeror shall submit a non-proprietary title and summary, not to exceed one (1) additional page.

Multiple concept papers addressing different research areas may be submitted by each offeror; however, each concept paper should address only one concept.     Those concept papers found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a complete technical and price proposal.     AN INVITATION BASED UPON A SUBMITTED CONCEPT PAPER DOES NOT ASSURE THAT THE OFFEROR WILL BE AWARDED A SUBSEQUENT CONTRACT. 

F.         BASIS FOR AWARD

(1) Concept papers will be evaluated as they are received based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other concepts submitted under this announcement.     Concept papers will be evaluated under the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: 

(a) The extent to which the proposed concept makes the Air Force lighter, leaner or more lethal, 

(b) Impact of the proposed concept on one or more of the six Air Force Distinctive Capabilities (Air and Space Superiority, Global Attack, Rapid Global Mobility, Precision Engagement, Information Superiority, Agile Combat Support), 

(c) Technical merit of the proposed concept with an emphasis on novel, creative, and innovative solutions, and 

(d) Proposed cost.     

All four areas, (a) through (d), will be evaluated at the same time during the evaluation process.     No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the concept papers.

(2) Anticipated Period of Performance: Average duration of demonstrations will be up to 15 months from time of award through complete evaluation and demonstration of the operational concept.     However, some initiatives may require more resources depending on complexity of the concept.     Type of contract(s) expected: Firm-Fixed Price (Unless another contract type is determined by the contracting officer to be more appropriate).     Primary appropriation type: Operations and Maintenance

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), on behalf of The National Highway Institute, intends to award multiple, 5-year term, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts under which fixed price Task Orders will be issued. The Task Orders may require the development, revision, updating, and/or presentation nationwide of training courses in the broad areas of Structures, Hydraulics and Geotechnical technologies.  

The National Highway Institute (NHI) is the technical training arm of the Federal Highway Administration, and as such plays a vital role in the FHWA=s overall effort to provide training in new and evolving highway related technologies.  The target audience is very broad, and includes Federal, state and local highway and transportation agencies located within the United States, the Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers, associations, consulting firms, private industry, universities and other national and international entities engaged in highway work of interest to the United States.  In order for NHI to best accomplish its training mission it is necessary to accurately determine the needs of the target audience, and then develop and deliver a variety of training packages that will most effectively and efficiently present the intended message.  Annual issues of the NHI Course Catalog and the NHI web site (http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov) contain a list of current course offerings.

The NHI has been performing this role primarily by delivering traditional, instructor-lead, classroom training on a broad range of topic areas since it was established by congress in 1970.  However, the electronic era is rapidly opening new avenues for cost savings, complying with divergent schedules, and training larger audiences in shorter periods of time.  These avenues need to be explored, and enhancements to the current approaches implemented.

In addition to a thorough knowledge of instructional systems design (ISD) and adult learning principals, subject matter expertise will be required in a variety of areas including, but not limited to: 

Design, construction, inspection, coatings and security of highway structures including bridges, culverts, tunnels and ancillary structures; all aspects of hydrologic and hydraulic engineering; and all aspects of geotechnical engineering related to highway structures.

Training delivery methods may include traditional classroom, distance learning, web-based and/or computer-based self-teaching.  Task Orders may also include other functions relating to training delivery such as needs assessment, marketing, or electronic formatting for Section 508 compliance. It may also include the conduct of any research required for the development of a specific course, and other support services that may be required for the promotion of the training program.

All qualified, responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer. The Government intends to award these contracts on the basis of best value after Full and Open Competition.
The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date. The solicitation and related documents will be posted under the RFP number. Interested parties must download the RFP from that site. NO WRITTEN, TELEPHONIC, FACSIMILE, OR E-MAIL REQUESTS for copies will be honored. 

Please note that FedBizOpps has a feature called “Interested Vendors List.” Those interested in subcontracting, teaming, supporting, consulting and the like should register (the grey button at the bottom of the synopsis titled, Register to Receive Notification), and prime contractors should review the names posted there.

Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FebBizOpps website for any solicitation amendments. Note that interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive e-mail announcements and notifications of postings related to this RFP.  The ESTIMATED release date of the RFP is November 8, 2005. NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

ATTENTION: Minority, Women-owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.

<DESC>The objective of the Mainframe Application Conversion Pilot Project is to investigate the feasibility of using automated methods and services to solve the business problem of converting the Bank’s mainframe-based, legacy, NATURAL/ADABAS applications to an alternative Java/JSP/HTML/Oracle environment.  To that end, the contractor that possesses this type of automated conversion technology will take one of our existing mainframe-based, NATURAL/ADABAS applications and to use their technology to produce a fully functional application using processes that could serve as a model for the complete conversion and implementation of NATURAL/ADABAS legacy applications to a Java/JSP/HTML/Oracle, web-enabled environment.  The delivered application is to capture and preserve the general functionality, business rules, business logic and operational integrity of the original application, while freeing us from the expensive and outdated technologies on which these critical IT assets were originally built.  The delivered application should also be sustainable without requiring the availability of the contractor that performs the conversion.  During this pilot project, the Contractor will be expected to demonstrate the viability, reliability and efficiency of their automated conversion solution.  In addition, the Contractor will be asked to use their experience with conversion of the selected system and information provided to them on our other existing mainframe-based systems to estimate (non-binding) the cost and time that are reasonable for the replacement of the remainder of those systems.

The selected contractor will be asked to:
1.	Compare available application server environments and provide the Bank with recommendations on which HW/SW platform we should use for the converted application.
2.	Perform the conversion of one of our small mainframe-based applications in a relatively short time frame and assist in deploying the converted system in the selected test environment.  Additional data fields and tables will be added to the database for future enhancements.
3.	Make corrections to the application during the testing period and until completion of the quality assurance phase where we have verified that it performs exactly the way the mainframe-based application did.
4.	Provide limited (about 120 hours) of consulting services for enhancements/added limited functionality to the converted applications.
5.	Analyze our other mainframe applications and provide us with a non-binding estimate of both the cost and time it would take to migrate the remainder of our mainframe-based applications into our new environment.

PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT THEIR OFFERS ELECTRONICALLY OR VIA FAX. IF HARD COPY IS TO BE SUBMITTED, YOU ARE ADVISED TO USE A COURIER SERVICE IN LIEU OF THE U.S. MAIL, DUE TO THE TIME LAG ASSOCIATED WITH MAIL SERVICE.

<DESC>The Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT) contractors will design and conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of around-the-clock, supplemental oxygen therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and moderately severe hypoxemia. This trial is needed to provide a scientific basis for decisions regarding the clinical use of long-term oxygen treatment. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve clinical management of COPD, with increased length and quality of life for patients with COPD.  
The LOTT will consist of one DCC and approximately 20 regional clinical centers (RCCs). The RCCs will be awarded under RFP NHLBI-HR-06-07 and the DCC will be awarded under RFP NHLBI-HR-06-08. The LOTT will test the efficacy of supplemental oxygen treatment in subjects with COPD, moderately severe hypoxemia, and other risk factors for premature death such as severe dyspnea, exercise limitation, low body mass, or frequent exacerbations. The trial will be designed to detect a difference in mortality between two groups randomized to receive long-term oxygen treatment or usual care with periodic monitoring of hypoxemic status. The trial will also test for possible differences in quality of life.  Contractors will design and carry out the clinical trial, monitor and report adverse events, analyze the study data, submit results of the study and substudies for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and engage in other dissemination activities. Each RCC will organize and manage a network of cooperating sites (such as hospitals, clinics, pulmonary rehabilitation centers, and physician offices) to assist in subject enrollment, characterization, and follow up. It is expected that a total of approximately 5000 subjects will be enrolled over a 3 - 3½ year period and that subjects will be followed for an additional year after the end of the enrollment period.   The trial will be conducted in three phases.  During Phase I (6 months) investigators will meet to develop the Protocol(s), model informed consent document(s), Manual of Operations, and study forms. The Steering Committee will develop procedures and tools for training of staff, randomization of subjects, data management, and quality assurance/quality control of study activities and data. Staff will assist the DCC in the development of study forms. During Phase II (4 years 6 months) staff will be trained, subjects screening and recruited, interventions, and follow-up will be performed at the RCCs and data collection and monitoring will occur at the DCC.  During Phase III investigators will engage in dissemination activities which include data analysis and reporting.  This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP).  It is anticipated that the RFPs will be available on or about November 8, 2005 at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp and posted on FedBizOpps at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.   This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541710.

<DESC>Aircraft Brake Assembly Test Stand

Hydraulic System
The Skydrol 500B or other similar hydraulic fluid required for operation of the test stand is contained in a 10-gallon stainless steel reservoir. The reservoir includes a fluid sight level gauge. Hydraulic fluid from the reservoir flows to the inlet of an electrically powered pump delivering up to 3 GPM at up to 300 PSIG. A pneumatically driven, static high pressure supply pump provides up to 0.5 GPM at up to 4600 PSIG. The test stand’s high flow, low pressure system is used for bleeding and flushing the brake assemblies and the high pressure, low flow system is used for pressure testing the brake assemblies. 
Included in the hydraulic supply circuits are a 100-Mesh strainer, a 3 micron filter, a pressure supply shutoff valve, flow control ball valves, a bypass valve to control supply pressure to the brakes and a back pressure control valve that can be adjusted to maintain the minimum back pressure that some brake assemblies require. 
The test stand includes a return circuit to facilitate flushing and bleeding of the brake assemblies. The circuit includes a check valve and a sight glass to observe air bubbles (aeration) in the fluid when bleeding brake assemblies. 
Pneumatic System
Customer supplied shop air capable of providing 75-125 PSIG is connected to the test stand. The shop air is filtered to 5-micron within the test stand. An air hose is provided in the test sink area for air tools or an air blow-off nozzle. 
Electrical System
A 115 or 230 VAC (customer-specified), 1 phase, 50/60 Hertz power supply is required to power the hydraulic pump motor. Control and instrument power is generated and distributed within the test stand as required. 
The test stand is equipped with a “power-on” light and a control power switch to control the low pressure supply pump. and the cycling of the brake supply pressure. 
As an option, cycling o test pressures may controlled automatically by the addition of a PLC and pressure transducers to the test stand. Otherwise, cycling is typically performed manually. f 
Safety System
Operator and test stand safety are assured through safe design and safety precautions. Hazardous equipment is guarded and gauges will have safety blow out plugs. Potential hazards are also clearly marked with proper safety and emergency procedures. 
Instrumentation
The basic test stand incorporates analog pressures gauges.

This adjustable design approach removes the need for individual adapters for each wheel that is supported. It also allows the equipment operator to choose the optimum diameter around the outer portion of the wheel halves for any tire size by simply adjusting the four (4) adjustable Spider Segments on each side mounted Pressure Plate to the desired wheel/tire diameter. The four Segments are evenly spaced to provide equal pressure around the entire tire bead diameter. 
The height of the bead breaker's spindle arms may be adjusted to accommodate nearly any height wheel assembly with a single adjustment to the hydraulic elevation system. The elevating hydraulic cylinders at the base of the unit raise and lower the Spider Segment plates to the appropriate wheel height. There are two of them, one on each side of the unit to ensure a level adjustment of the height of the bead breaking Spiders. The control for this function is conveniently placed on the control box at the operator station in the right, front side of the unit. 
Standard Features Include: 
(2) Two Hydraulic Cylinders with 60,000 LB Capacity 
ƒnElectric Powered Pumping Unit 
ƒnFrame Hydraulically Elevates To Wheel Size (No Lifting of Heavy Wheel Assemblies) 
ƒnAdjustable Spider Segments (No Lifting of Heavy Adapter Rings)

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The objective of the Mainframe Application Conversion Pilot Project is to investigate the feasibility of using automated methods and services to solve the business problem of converting the Bank’s mainframe-based, legacy, NATURAL/ADABAS applications to an alternative Java/JSP/HTML/Oracle environment.  To that end, the contractor that possesses this type of automated conversion technology will take one of our existing mainframe-based, NATURAL/ADABAS applications and to use their technology to produce a fully functional application using processes that could serve as a model for the complete conversion and implementation of NATURAL/ADABAS legacy applications to a Java/JSP/HTML/Oracle, web-enabled environment.  The delivered application is to capture and preserve the general functionality, business rules, business logic and operational integrity of the original application, while freeing us from the expensive and outdated technologies on which these critical IT assets were originally built.  The delivered application should also be sustainable without requiring the availability of the contractor that performs the conversion.  During this pilot project, the Contractor will be expected to demonstrate the viability, reliability and efficiency of their automated conversion solution.  In addition, the Contractor will be asked to use their experience with conversion of the selected system and information provided to them on our other existing mainframe-based systems to estimate (non-binding) the cost and time that are reasonable for the replacement of the remainder of those systems.

The selected contractor will be asked to:
1.	Compare available application server environments and provide the Bank with recommendations on which HW/SW platform we should use for the converted application.
2.	Perform the conversion of one of our small mainframe-based applications in a relatively short time frame and assist in deploying the converted system in the selected test environment.  Additional data fields and tables will be added to the database for future enhancements.
3.	Make corrections to the application during the testing period and until completion of the quality assurance phase where we have verified that it performs exactly the way the mainframe-based application did.
4.	Provide limited (about 120 hours) of consulting services for enhancements/added limited functionality to the converted applications.
5.	Analyze our other mainframe applications and provide us with a non-binding estimate of both the cost and time it would take to migrate the remainder of our mainframe-based applications into our new environment.

PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT THEIR OFFERS ELECTRONICALLY OR VIA FAX. IF HARD COPY IS TO BE SUBMITTED, YOU ARE ADVISED TO USE A COURIER SERVICE IN LIEU OF THE U.S. MAIL, DUE TO THE TIME LAG ASSOCIATED WITH MAIL SERVICE.

Additionally, BAE will be integrating 3rd party toxic industrial sensors (TICs) in to the baseline UGS.  Integration of Chemsonde and TIC sensors require previous experience with the BAE proprietary Chemical Warfare Agent (CWA) sensor.  Specifically, the development and implementation of MNUGS with TICS capability requires the integration of TICS sensors with the BAE proprietary CWA sensor.  The integration of MNUGS with TICS capability into the Critical Area Protection System requires modifications to BAE Proprietary mess!  age code previously developed.  Accordingly, only BAE can perform the integration.  Shipping will be to: Naval Support Activity, Panama City, Florida. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled VIBRATION CONTROL SYSTEMS, which was posted on October 12, 2005. The purpose of this modification is to address the following vendor questions: Questions and Answers are as follows: Q)  1. It looks like six isolators are required per 5x16 foot bench.  But at one point there's a mention of "3 low load isolators."  Is 6 per bench the correct number? A)  1. Six isolators are required per bench. Q)  2. The Technical Requirements define relatively narrowly a system that has passive resonant frequencies 15 Hz and above (at least 15 Hz for vertical).  Question:	if an active-passive system achieves the overall requirements including an active suspension frequency (vertical, I assume) of 0.5 Hz and 90% or better isolation above 2 Hz, is it necessary to have the passive system above 15 Hz? A)  2. Yes. Q)  3. If the suspension frequencies were lower than 0.5 Hz, say 0.3-0.4 Hz, would it be possible to accept an amplification at resonance greater than 1.1? A)  3. No. Q)  4. Are the vibration isolation/control systems to be used in a relatively typical laboratory environment?  Specifically, is any unusually large floor or base vibration expected? A)  4. Floor excitation is expected. Q)  5. Does the requirement for magnetic field emitted (0.2 microgauss or less - a very small number) have a measurement distance associated with it?	Is it in fact a driving requirement? A)  5. This is	a low EMI test facility with each system component to have a maximum magnetic field	discharge of .02 micro gauss. Q)  6. Will these systems ever be used in a vacuum environment? A)  6. No. The due date for responses is not] extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<CONTACT>Megan Robey, Contracting Officer , Phone 301-504-3989, Fax 301-504-4276, Email megan.robey@fsis.usda.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is seeking sources capable of providing the agency with a single in-plant test that is capable of detecting sulfas and antibiotics at the tolerance level in porcine and bovine kidney.  The current in-plant test was developed by FSIS and it called the Fast Anti-microbial Screening Test (FAST Test). The FAST test is capable of detecting beta lactams (both penicillins and cephalosporins), aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines, and sulfas.  FAST is not capable, however, of detecting sulfas at the 100 ppb level, which is the tolerance for several sulfa compounds.  Tolerances for drugs in these classes may be found at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=556


The respondent will need to generate or submit data on a range of drugs from each compound class. If data need to be generated, the respondent should plan on completing the data package in four months.  The respondent needs to submit a description of the protocol used to determine the limits of detection, which should reflect tests run in an appropriate matrix (not water or buffer).  After a review of the submitted data, FSIS may request additional data. 

The test must be suitable for in-plant use.  Organic solvents, toxic reagents, and radioactive constituents must not be required.  The test must be simple to apply and not require the use of complicated laboratory equipment (such as; certain types of homogenizing equipment, certain spectrophotometers, etc.). A broad window of observation must be present, more specifically; an ideal window of observation would be from six (6) to eighteen (18) hours.  Any test submitted for consideration needs to be practical for plants having one (1) to three (3) shifts per day. 

The potential suppliers will need to describe the method used to determine the limits of detection, and the limits of detection for each drug tested.  A complete description of the procedure, along with estimated times required per analysis, should also be submitted.   

Limit of detection data on fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin and danofloxacin), chloramphenicol, and florfenicol should also be submitted.  

Last calendar year, FSIS ran approximately 145,000 FAST Tests.  Although, FSIS cannot identify how many tests will be needed in the future this figure should be used as a guide when providing price estimates in response to this sources sought synopsis. 

If you are a source capable of providing such a test please respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis with your company information, along with pricing information.  Respondents are asked to identify their business size in their response to this sources sought synopsis.  The NAICS Code associated with this notice is 325414 and the size standard is 500 employees.  This notice is not a request for proposals and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the information they provide.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, the information will be used in FSIS’s assessment of capable sources.  Responses should be submitted by November 21, 2005.  Faxed responses are not permitted.  Questions concerning this announcement may be submitted via email only, no telephone inquires will be honored.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Aviation & Missile Command, Assistant Product Manager for the Test Equipment Modernization Program (APM-TEMOD) is responsible for the acquisition of the state-of-the-art, commercial/non-developmental general purpose test equipment. The new equipment will be used to standardize the inventory and replace existing obsolete test equipment. A draft purchase description/specification has been developed for a Radio Test Set.  The Radio Test Set is required for field testing of general purpose a nd frequency hopping radios in the 500 kHz to 2 GHz frequency range.  The Radio Test Set will have the following stimulus and measurement capability: signal generator (radio frequency and audio frequency), counter, power, deviation, modulation, distortion,  sinad, multimeter (voltage, current, and resistance), oscilloscope (time domain), and spectrum analysis (frequency domain).  Two questionnaires (Specification Questionnaire and the Manufacturers Survey Questionnaire) have been developed to assist the Gov ernment in defining the final purchase description/specification by providing information about the technical capabilities of available commercial/non-development Radio Test Sets.  In the Specification Questionnaire, the manufacturer is asked to compare th eir candidate product specifications to the Governments Draft Specification.  In the Manufacturers Survey Questionnaire, the manufacturer is asked to respond to questions regarding reliability, maintainability, support, and other logistics topics.  No de cision has been made at this time as to the type of procurement, i.e. full and open competition versus small business set-aside.  Interested contractors may request a draft purchase description/specification and questionnaire by contacting Mr. Wayne L. Wol f, (256) 876-2918 or e-mail: wayne.wolf@redstone.army.mil, fax: (256) 313-2940.  Request for a draft purchase description/specification and questionnaires should be made no later than 4 Nov 05.  The Government will extend an invitation to each and every ma nufacturer that wants to attend a Joint Working Group (JWG) meeting between industry and Government.  Each manufacturer attending the JWG will be required to complete the Specification Questionnaire and Manufacturers Survey Questionnaire.  Completed Speci fication Questionnaire and Manufacturers Survey Questionnaire will be required to be returned to the Government no later than one week prior to the start of the JWG meeting.  The JWG meeting is tentatively scheduled for the week of 28 Nov 05 to 1 Dec 05.  Each attending manufacturer will meet with Government personnel for approximately 3 to 4 hours.

Description: The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Warfighting Support, Information Operations (ODUSD (IWS)/IO) and the Air Force Information Warfare Center (AFIWC) are pleased to announce the 12th Phoenix Challenge Conference.  Phoenix Challenge 2006 Conference - Baltimore will be held January 31 to February 2, 2006 at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHUAPL), Laurel, Maryland.  Phoenix Challenge Conferences provide open-forum opportunities to discuss IO modernization and transformation programs, requirements, challenges and solutions.  This conference will be classified in its entirety, except for the social and round table sessions in the afternoon, February 1st.

The theme of the conference is Testing, Training, and Exercising IO for the Warfighter focusing on Combatant Command and Service IO Test, Training, and Exercise challenges and successes.  It will include a systematic discussion on IO environments and ranges; new IO capabilities, advanced technologies; and intelligence needed in the test/training environments.  The agenda will include a comprehensive series of IO topics with perspectives from senior-level leaders, warfighters, testers, trainers, industry and academia.  At the conference you will gain a clearer understanding of Combatant Command challenges and lessons-learned in IO training, exercising and operations in the field; learn what IO test and training environments, locations and capabilities exist; gain knowledge in unique challenges and requirements, to include those identified at other IO conferences; understand the intelligence needed to support IO test or exercise; and share experiences with other members of the IO community.

Individuals and organizations are encouraged to propose and prepare briefings and papers for potential inclusion in the conference agenda and proceedings.  The proceedings will be made available to the Phoenix Challenge IO community.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.

Solicitation number HC1047-05-R-4035 is being issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-04.  The North American Classification is 541710 and the Size Standard is 107,812 employees.  The requirement is solicited on an open market basis for potential set-aside to a small business.

The following FAR and DFAR clauses apply:

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items.
FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items
FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items

This procurement is estimated to be $132,000.00, including labor, travel, and materials.  The period of performance is one year.  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Joint Spectrum Center (JSC), is seeking sources that are capable of designing and evaluating protocols for wireless ad-hoc networks that enable efficient spectrum utilization while providing adequate Quality of Service (QoS) required for mission critical applications.

Recent advances reported in the technical literature outline a general framework for cross-layer optimization in wireless networks, which considers joint optimization of signal power levels, instantaneous data rates, routing, antenna weighting, link scheduling, and other parameters that can be used to increase wireless system capacity and reduce unintended interference..  Of particular interest is the development of advanced ad-hoc wireless protocols that intelligently manage the trade-offs between efficient spectrum utilization and QoS.  Sources must be familiar with such recent advances and be able to concretely demonstrate how a cross-layer optimization framework can be applied to the joint design of protocols for routing, scheduling, data rate, power control, and frequency spectrum allocation, within a framework of an accurate network model which captures network-wide interference.

The proposal should focus on the Spectrum-network Management convergence that enables efficient spectrum utilization while providing adequate QoS required for mission critical applications in light of the transformation to network-centric operations.  The proposal should address one or more (but is not limited to) the following areas: (1) interaction between routing, scheduling, and frequency assignment to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of Department of Defense spectrum use, (2) capability to cope with network dynamics when unexpected external interference or node mobility causes changes in connectivity, and (3) method for determining of candidate routes, scheduling and frequency assignment algorithm.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   overall scientific or technical merits, innovativeness of approach/techniques, plan of execution and principle investigator, and realism of the proposed cost.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  Proposals are due by 10:00 AM EST on 25Jul05 and must be submitted by email to Franklin Wheeler, Jr. at franklin.wheelerf@jsc.mil.  Inquiries regarding the solicitation will only be accepted via email.

1.  The revised Statement of Work for this requirement is as follows:

Interpreting Services

Statement of Work for Interpreting Services
Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)


1.  BACKGROUND

It is the policy of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), a federal agency, to provide equal employment opportunities for its employees, former employees, as well as applicants for employment with DFAS.  The DFAS agency wide Interpreter Services contract is from October 2005 through September 2010 (five years) for all DFAS sites where there are employees requiring the accommodation.  Current sites are:

Arlington, VA		Cleveland, OH		Columbus, OH
Charleston, SC		Denver, CO		Indianapolis, IN
Kansas City, MO		Norfolk, VA		Oakland, CA
Pensacola, FL		San Diego, CA		Dayton, OH
Limestone, ME		Omaha, NE		San Bernardino, CA
Lexington, KY		Lawton, OK		Rome, NY
Seaside, CA		St. Louis, MO		Rock Island, IL
Orlando, FL		San Antonio, TX		Patuxent River, NJ

All of the above locations except Cleveland, OH; Columbus, OH; Indianapolis, IN; Limestone, ME; and Rome, NY are in a BRAC situation so the needs of those that are being considered for BRAC are subject to change.

II.  PURPOSE

DFAS¡¦ policies and practices are in full compliance with the laws and regulations governing equal employment opportunity.  Interpreting services are required on an as needed basis.  Interpreting services will be provided for Deaf/Hard of Hearing employees located agency wide throughout DFAS.  This contract is intended to provide interpreting services to DFAS locations when required.

III.  DESCRIPTION AND SCOPE OF WORK

Requirements under the micro-purchase threshold (currently $2,500.00) shall be contracted by Government credit card (IMPAC card) holders using the terms and conditions (including prices) established in the contract to which this Statement of Work is incorporated.

Upon notification of an interpreting requirement that will exceed the $2,500.00 IMPAC card limit, the EEO POC will contact the Contract Services Directorate (CSD) POC within time to meet the requirements and provide the following information:


„h Identify type of interpreters required (American Sign Language and/or Oral).
„h Dates of the event to include daily start and end times.
„h POC at department that requested interpreter (name, telephone number, location).
„h Forward copy of approved DD Form 1262.
„h Name(s) of Deaf/Hard of Hearing employee(s).
„h Type of interpreting event(s).
„h Length of time for the event(s).
„h Location of the interpreting event(s).

The Contract Services Directorate (CSD) will then contact the contracted interpreting vendor within one business day.  Upon receipt of the telephone request from the CSD POC, the interpreting vendor will respond within two business days concerning availability/acceptance of the assignment.  Within 24 hours, the CSD contracting officer will then contact the EEO POC to advise that a task order has been executed. 

The EEO POC shall provide the following information to the vendor immediately upon notice of approval of the task order:

„h Directions to the site and instructions regarding restricted entry, if any.
„h Name and telephone number of the on-site POC.
„h Parking arrangements at the site.
„h Any other site-specific information.

The Site POC or requestor is responsible for ensuring that interpreters are sign-in upon arrival, escorted to the event(s) where the service is needed, and ensuring the interpreter(s) is escorted to the check-out location, as necessary.

The individual requesting the interpreting service must request interpreter(s) services as follows:

„h Seven business days in advance of any single event.
„h Fourteen days in advance for a large or long (more than 24 interpreting hours) work/training session.
„h Emergency requests will be handled based upon the availability of interpreting service(s).

The EEO POC is responsible for payment of the following charges:

„h Additional charges if the Business Unit fails to request an interpreter(s) in sufficient time for processing request.
„h Cancellation fees if the EEO POC does not timely cancel an interpreting request.

The interpreting agency is responsible for ensuring interpreters have complete and accurate job information prior to day of assignment.

Interpreter(s) must arrive approximately 30 minutes before scheduled assignment to clear security, where required.  The contract will not include a provision for reimbursement of an interpreter¡¦s travel time.  Billed time begins with security check in and concludes with the conclusion of the event.  For multi day events, the second and subsequent days will be billed for the actual hours of the event.  Time taken for meals shall not be billed.  Other breaks are billable.

Interpreter(s) must contact the identified on-site POC upon arrival for assistance with accessing the facility.

Interpreter(s) must notify the on-site POC if an assignment is canceled or completed early.  If this occurs, the on-site POC reserves the right to reassign the interpreter(s) to another assignment at the site.

Interpreter assignment will end when the contracted time expires or when the on-site POC releases the interpreter(s).

IV.  INTERPRETER VENDOR RESPONSIBILITIES

The interpreter(s) shall provide the following resources at no additional cost to the Government:

„h All equipment and related materials (if required), and
„h All office supplies, if required.

The interpreter(s) shall bear responsibility for the cost of:

„h Administrative support services (if used),
„h Travel and subsistence costs incurred in the performance of the interpreting, in accordance with the following for special interpreting situations.

V.  TRAVEL

While the contractor has discretion in assigning personnel, unless prior approval has been obtained from the COR, the principle of minimizing costs to the Government is controlling.  No travel or per diem will be reimbursed for local travel.  Government travel information can be accessed at the following websites: http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/home.jsp and http://www.govexec.com/travel.

VI.  QUALIFICATION

The Americans with Disabilities Act requires the provision of qualified interpreters in a variety of settings.  To satisfy this requirement, the interpreter must have the proven ability to effectively communicate.  One way to demonstrate an interpreter¡¦s proven ability is by initially obtaining and then maintaining professional interpreter certification.  Certification is obtained by taking and passing an assessment of skills.  The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) offers the NAD-RID National Interpreters Certification and various RID certifications.  To be considered nationally certified, an interpreter must complete and pass one of RID¡¦s written and performance tests and participate in a maintenance program to maintain their certification.  Proven ability may, on a case by case basis, also be demonstrated by a record of professional level interpreting service in a variety of settings over the period of at least one-year.  Non-certified interpreters may be evaluated by the agency¡¦s Interpreter Coordinator to determine level of ability and proficiency.  Proficiency may also be evaluated based on the customer comments received from the dear and hard of hearing employee.

VII.  BILLING POLICY AND POC

The EEO POC will act as the technical POC for the Government.  He/She will initiate all requests and monitor all vendor performance.  The EEO POC¡¦s authority is limited to technical reviews and does not authorize him/her to make contractual decisions.  The authority to resolve monetary issues and contractual interpretation is the responsibility of the contracting officer.

The EEO POC for this contract is Lloyd Stout, (317) 510-7349.
The alternate EEO POC is Mary Legree-Ford, (317) 510-2165.

Invoices shall be submitted to the EEO POC in accordance with the rate/prices established in this contract.  The EEO POC is responsible for certification of invoices and forwarding invoices for payment.  Payment will be made in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act.

VIII.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

The period of performance shall be one base year plus four one-year option periods.  In the event that an option year is exercised, the contractor will be responsible for updating all materials in conjunction with DFAS Subject Matter Experts (SME), working through the COR.

IX.  GOVERNMENT FACILITY ENTRANCE

All contractor personnel or any representative of the contractor entering any government facility or government leased facility shall abide by all security regulations and be subject to security checks.  Access to a DFAS site must be coordinated with the local point of contact to ensure that any site-specific requirements are met.

Security and Privacy Act Requirements: All work-performed relative to the tasking identified in the SOW are unclassified or carry a Privacy Act Classification.  System security shall be in accordance with DoD Directive 5200.28, Security Requirements for AIS.

Security Investigation Requirements: No classified work will be required.  However, the contractor will be working with sensitive information which is covered by the Privacy Act and which is category ADP/AIS II.  Contractor must ensure sensitive (privacy act) information is properly safeguarded at the work site and not removed from the work site.  Also, the contractor will be required to comply with the security requirements associated with access to the DFAS enterprise network.  This requires individuals who perform duties at the ADP/AIS II category to have a favorable determination of requisite investigation IAW the specifications of the DoD Personnel Security Program as provided for in the DoD 5200.2-R.  If declared, the contractor may be requested to undergo a higher level of investigation.  The Government will not incur the investigation expenses caused by contractor employee turnover or replacement within a year¡¦s time.  The National Agency Check (NAC) includes the following:

„h Standard Form 85P - Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions
„h FD 258 - Finger Print Card

All contractor personnel requiring access to the DFAS systems will complete a National Agency Check (NAC).  The SF 85P will be completed using the Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire (EPSQ).  EPSQs are available for downloading on the Defense Security Service (DSS) Web Site at www.dss.mil\epsq.  Completed EPSQs, to include a copy on a disk and a signed hard copy, will be provided to the Contract Officer¡¦s Representative (COR) or Government Point of Contact (GPOC) elsewhere named in this award.  All 85Ps must be accompanied with a copy of the contractor¡¦s birth certificate for citizenship verification.  Foreign Nationals must submit appropriate documentation from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Employment of non-US citizens requires a fully completed and favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to beginning DFAS work. The COR/GPOC will notify the contractor when contractor employees have been approved for access to the facility.  The NACs should be completed before the contractor employee begins work. However, on an exception basis and if an emergency situation exists, a US citizen contractor employee may begin once the NAC has been reviewed, initiated, and there is no derogatory information and the COR/GPOC obtains contractor badges.  Those US citizen contractors needed to begin work prior to receipt of a favorable NAC must have a waiver of pre-appointment investigative requirements approved by the proponent Business Line Executive, Client Executive, or Corporate Director.    All contractor employees must receive a favorable NAC.  Unfavorable NAC findings will require individual determinations by the cognizant DFAS security office prior to allowing contractor employee access to the facility.
