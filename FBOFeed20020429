The General Services Administration (GSA) announces its intention to renovate the existing Foley Federal Building and United States Courthouse for occupancy by October 2004.   The facility to be renovated is a reinforced concrete building built in early 1960s.   It consists of a four-story superstructure, a basement, and a penthouse housing service equipment.   The building provides surface parking for the tenants in the rear yard; it does not provide any interior parking.   The gross area of the building, including the basement level, is approximately 205,000 GSF.  The building will be completely vacated for construction.   US Bankruptcy Court, Marshal Service, Probation, Trustee, HUD, and SSA will occupy the building upon completion of the project.   USBC will operate five courtrooms in the building.   Renovation will primarily include asbestos and lead-based-paint abatement, blast prevention structural reinforcement, space realignment and finishing, courtroom renovation and preservation, entrance and lobby first impression work, handicap- accessing compliance, environmental-friendly recycling and disposal, and energy-conservation.   The selected General Contractor is expected to deliver a thorough and high-quality product to the Government under the terms of the Construction Contract.   
Tetra Design, Inc. of Los Angeles (the Design Architect) is currently preparing the Construction Documents for the project.   The CD will be finalized by April 29, 2002.   Prior to bidding for this project, the Offeror must inspect the construction site, review the CD for accuracy, check all descriptions and cross-references, and list and report observed inaccuracies to GSA.   The proposed price must include the effect of all inaccuracies and the needed remedial work.   The successful Offeror upon award of the construction contract will become the General Contractor.   
The estimated total construction cost of the project is in the range of $19-$21 million.   Construction award to the General Contractor is scheduled for August 1, 2002.   Construction completion date is tentatively set for August 1, 2004.
The General Contractor for construction services will be acquired in accordance with the Competitive Acquisition under the Part 15 procedures.     
Step One (1) is a presolicitation notice to identify potential offerors technically qualified to perform the renovation project.   Potential Offerors are invited to attend a presubmittal conference to be held at the Foley Federal Building & Courthouse, Las Vegas, NV on May 15, 2002 at 1:00 PM.  Attendees must submit a letter of intent in response to this notice by May 10, 2002, either by FAX (415) 522-3316 or sending e-mail to elisa.sanchez@gsa.gov.   Each potential offeror will submit a concise statement of its corporate background, resources and capabilities, past performance on similar projects, technical and managerial qualifications of the firm, bonding capacity, financial capability and professional levels of individuals proposed for the project.   Specific names are not required during Step One.  The offerors must submit information that allows the Government to advise offerors about their potential to be viable competitors and participate in Step Two (2).   Each Offeror will be evaluated for the quality and thoroughness of its qualification in response to this notice.  All responses will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated in this notice.  The Contracting Officer shall advise the respondents considered not viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion.  All respondents considered viable competitors will be advised that they may participate in the resultant acquisitions. 
Step Two (2) will use the Request for Proposals (RFP) to communicate Government requirements to prospective contractors and to solicit proposals.  During Step Two (2), the viable competitors will be required to submit a fully developed Technical and Price Proposals.  The RFP will thoroughly describe the Government's requirements.  The RFP will be issued to the prospective offerors by June 10, 2002.  The RFP will thoroughly describe the Governments requirements and the basis for the selection of the General Contractor.   The Government does not provide any stipend for the preparation of proposals to the Offerors.  The Offeror for this project can be a joint venture, partnership, corporation, association or any other legal entity with collective contractual responsibility to successfully perform the project.  If the offeror is an entity comprised of more than one firm, the identity and credentials of the firms will be evaluated separately and as a whole.  
Selecting an Offeror is not restricted to any specific geographic area.  However, at least fifty percent of the construction work must be performed within the State of Nevada.  The General Contractor must have a functional office in southern Nevada.
In response to the Presolicitation Notice, the potential offerors must submit the following by May 31, 2002 at 2:00 PM:
1.	Submit a letter of intent for the advertised project.
2.	Submit summary level information for three to five projects previously performed by the Offeror resembling the advertised project.
3.	Submit description and a picture for each previous project.
4.	Submit information on building configuration, size, usage, and final cost for each previous project.
5.	Submit names, addresses and telephone numbers of the owner representatives for each previous project.
6.	Submit explanations for delays and liquidated damages for each previous project.
7.	Submit a construction organization chart explaining generic positions proposed for the advertised project.
8.	Identify minimum level of education and experience proposed for each generic position.
9.	Certify that specific individuals proposed later, would meet or exceed the minimum generic standards set in the presolicitation notice.                                  
10.	Submit a two-page maximum management plan for the advertised project;
11.	Provide proof of Offeror?s financial stability for the advertised project;
12.	Provide proof of Offeror?s bonding capacity for the advertised project;
13.	Provide release forms authorizing GSA to obtain performance related information for the previously completed projects, from the owners of the projects;
Each potential offeror will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria: 
I.	Past Performance: This parameter evaluates level of similarity between the advertised project and projects performed in the past by the Offeror.   Each project will be evaluated for quality, budget and schedule compliance, owner satisfaction, and contractor response to warranty repairs.   The input for evaluation will be based on the Offeror?s response to the presolicitation notice and information obtained from the owner representatives who dealt with the Offeror on the project.   The owner representatives will be those identified by the Offeror in response to this notice.  Any comparable project indicated by the Offeror, must be at least 75% complete in order for it to be considered for this evaluation.
II.	Proposed Corporate Organization: This parameter evaluates the corporate side of the Offeror?s organization.  It will examine and rate the firms overall experience, track record, credentials, management philosophy and approach to projects, and managerial level qualification.   Other parameters considered would be the corporate ability to complete projects on time and within budget, current corporate workload, and projected workload coinciding with the timing of the advertised project.
III.	Proposed Construction Teams: The construction team proposed by the Offeror will be generic, meaning it would signify generic positions with minimum envisaged level of experience, education, length of service, geographic availability, and assignment within the Offeror?s organization chart for the project.   Specific names are not required until StepTwo, to give the Offeror enough time to be short-listed and then plan and organize a certain group of individuals to the project team.      
Offerors having qualifications to meet the requirements specified herein are invited to respond and submit the specified forms and documents required by the Presolicitation Notice.  All submittals must identify with this announcement and solicitation number.

The RFP package will only be available to the prospective offerors.  This solicitation and procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory anticipates awarding one Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract for architectural and engineering services.  The award is expected to be made within four months.  It is estimated that the maximum total fees of orders to be placed under either contract will not exceed $500,000.  The minimum value the Government will be required to order will be $25,000.  No single order will have a fee in excess of $300,000.  The contractor shall provide multi-disciplined design work with an emphasis on the mechanical and electrical engineering disciplines.  Design skills must be shown for the following building types: office buildings, industrial warehouses, and general laboratory space.  Typical architectural and engineering support may include the following types of efforts: (a) renovation and replacement of HVAC systems, re-design of water systems (internal to the building), installation and extension of sprinkler systems, installation of restrooms, and installation and retrofitting of elevators in existing buildings;  (b) modification of electrical systems and upgrading existing building power distribution systems;  (c) studies relating to code research, space planning, cost analysis, structural analysis and architectural evaluation;  (d) architectural and structural support services, which may include additions and/or significant renovation of existing spaces or buildings;  (e) demolition of buildings including removal of hazardous materials and assessment of environment concerns.  Asbestos and lead are know to be present, therefore the A&E firm shall identify and provide a design which will accommodate the disposal of these materials in the construction plans and specifications in accordance with applicable rules and regulations.  The first order to be placed under the prospective contract will be for a design to replace the current HVAC system in approximately 16,000 square feet of Building 71 located at the NRL.  The design will provide new chillers, hot water system, air handling units and ductwork.  The work will be phased to minimize the disruption to the occupants of the space (these occupants will not be moved for the replacement of the air conditioning system).  Access to all mechanical equipment will be provided.  Remediation of hazards will be required.  Firms responding to this announcement must do so in accordance with the requirements set forth in Note 24 and the evaluation criteria listed at FAR 36.602-1 and DFARS 236.602-1.  More Specifically, the evaluation criteria are as follows, listed in descending order of importance: (1) Provide specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, with significant emphasis on Architectural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical disciplines, and Elevators.  This proof of specialized experience and technical competence must include, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.  The A&E firm must indicate past experience by citing examples of the work required.  Responding A/E firms must address the potential project.  (2) Provide professional qualifications of personnel and proposed subcontractors for the project.  Examples must be provided for similar projects performed by the proposed team and the duties performed by each of the team members.  If the proposed team has not worked together before, the firm must provide experience of the individuals with their proven ability to work in a diverse team environment.  (3) Provide evidence of the firm's, as well as, the entire team's capacity to accomplish the work within the required time limits (usually nine weeks for the average projects plus Government review time).  It is important to demonstrate the firms ability to manage a number of projects at one time, such as would be required in an IDIQ type contract environment.  (4) Give past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  Demonstrating this should include things such as letters of commendation/appreciation, a list of contracts, preferably IDIQ type contracts with multiple orders, the points of contact and phone numbers for references.  (5) Location in the general geographic area of the project, provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; be sure to include subcontractors, if proposed.  (6) Provide the volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (for the last twelve months).  Those firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement, and wish to be considered, must respond no later than 4 p.m. on the response date.  The potential contract addressed herein will be awarded under full and open competition.  It is anticipated that the IDIQ type contract to be awarded as a result of this synopsis will have a 24 month period of performance from the date the contract is awarded.  This is not a request for proposal.  All interested parties must send copies of SF-252s and SF-254s to Contracting Officer, ATTN: Code 3230.MM.

<DESC>This is a synopsis to advertise a requirement for the Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards AFB CA. The requirement is for a two-channel baseband signal processing unit that will provide post&#64979;detection diversity branch selection (no-hit select and hold) as an alternative to diversity branch combining in receiving stations used for point-to-point air-to-ground data telemetry. This diversity branch selector (DBS) shall receive a reconstructed serial data stream (with coherent bit rate strobe clock) and, periodic serial digital signal quality estimates from each of two similar receiver sets. The role of the DBS is to continuously analyze the transmission quality signals from both receivers, periodically make decisions on relative and absolute diversity branch health and systematically consolidate the pair of reconstructed data streams into one data stream that represents a best attempt to bypass bit decision errors that may have occurred in one channel while the other was error free or producing a lower bit error rate. The DBS must automatically identify and compensate for differential transmission delays through the airline and receiving sets. In addition the DBS must accomplish its function at data rates up to 20 Mb/s (minimum) and automatically adapt to the data rate in use. The Government anticipates the award of a five-year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract. This will be a full and open competition. The Solicitation number is F04611-02-R-0024. The anticipated date of release for the solicitation is 15 May 2002. The Contracting Officer for this acquisition is Ms. Senah Williams, (661) 277-7708, or email:

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Meanline Modifications for Compatibility with Engine Analysis Code.  This work is to modify the meanline design and analysis codes Meanline Flowpath (MLFP) and Meanline Off-Design (MLOD) for use in the engine system analysis.  The contractor shall restructure the codes as batch versions; develop a subroutine to generate aerodynamic design inputs based on design assumptions; define interface details, input arguments, and output; develop design and analysis capability for partial admission turbines; remove the cooling routines; and provide support for the installation and implementation of the modules. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Riverbend Design Services pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: (a) In order for the engine system analysis to be compatible with the component design and analysis, the turbine meanline methodologies used for system and component design and analysis must be identical.  MLFP and MLOD are currently used for turbine design and analysis with great success at MSFC and will be modified for use in the engine system analysis.  (b) Riverbend Design Services (RDS) has worked with MSFC on the turbine aerodynamic design system for three years.  RDS is the developer of MLFP and MLOD.  A switch in contractors would adversely impact the continuity of the effort and raise serious questions as to the compatibility between required enhancements and modifications and the currently available system. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on May 14, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) plans to award a sole source  contract to Lockheed Martin Management and Data Systems (LMM&DS), P.O. Box 8048, Philadelphia, PA 19101 for technical services to provide software enhancement activities for the Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS). LMM&DS is the incumbent for engineering and development of the TTWCS.  This contract action will require the incumbent to work in close association with Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWC-DD) to support adaptive enhancements related to the continued evolution of TTWCS capabilities, perfective enhancements to improve software performance, suitability, reliability and maintainability, and corrective changes to fix defects.
      Initial TTWCS system level requirements included compliance with the Joint Technical Architecture, hardware-software independence, and for the TTWCS, to be expandable and extensible LMM&DS has independently developed core proprietary data that is necessary and essential for the enhancement activities of the TTWCS Operating Environment (OE).  The TTWCS Operating Environment supports intra software communications for Common Services and hardware diagnostics and by the use of Architecture Based Design (ABD) tools optimizes system design characteristics.  Detailed knowledge of ABD artifacts and design of the Operating Environment are therefore prerequisites to enable rapid response to correct emergent problems identified by the ships' forces and to support the addition of new system level requirements consistent with the evolutionary growth of software intensive weapon systems.  Additional requirements for this effort include certification within the past 24 months of a Level 3 or higher for software capability maturity using either the Software Engineering Institute Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for software development, or the CMM Integrated for Systems Engineering and Software development.  Accordingly, as the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the TTWCS, Lockheed Martin is the only firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and understanding of the TTWCS design and system architecture.   Therefore, award to any one other than the incumbent would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.
                The estimated period of performance for this prospective contractual action is 1 year, with 4 one-year options.  Note 22 applies.

PROPOSAL DUE DATE Proposals are due on or before 4:30 p.m. Mountain Daylight Time, 17 May 2002. B. METHOD OF SUBMITTING PROPOSALS Proposals may be submitted electronically through the DOE E-Center or may be submitted in hard copy to the Contracting Officer at the address shown in Item 9, below.  Published insurance materials that are not available in electronic format may be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer regardless of the method chosen to submit the proposal.  Proposals submitted electronically must be in a format that can be read by Microsoft Office Products. C.  CONTENT OF PROPOSALS Proposals should be no more than twenty-five (25) pages in length including prices.  Proposals must (1) describe offered health care benefits, limitations and exclusions, (2) substantiate the offeror's ability to provide the required administrative services by describing the firm's capabilities and resources, (2) provide at least three past performance references, and (4) provide premium and plan administration prices for each of the five years of the contract. The proposal may be accompanied by pre-printed brochures describing the offered insurance plan(s).  There is no page limitation on these brochures.  It is requested that offerors notify the Contracting Officer telephonically to verify submission of their proposal. 8. EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS AND CONTRACT AWARD A.  EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS Proposals will be evaluated to determine (1) which offered insurance plan provides the maximum number and level of benefits to the participants as a whole, (2) whether and how well the offeror can provide the required administrative services, (3) the extent to which the offeror has an acceptable past performance record, and (4) which offer provides the lowest premiums to the government.  Participant payment contributions will be evaluated as part of participant benefits, with low deductible and low co-payments being more advantageous.  The insurance, administrative services, and past performance will be evaluated in descending order of importance and when combined will be more important than the over-all premium price.  However, the premium price will be given increased weight in making the award decision as the other factors of competing proposals become more nearly equal. B. CONTRACT AWARD The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 9.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The RAIDS are required to ensure continued operational capability of the U.S. Navy's Tomahawk Mission Planning Systems. It is intended to award a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a 36-month ordering period. Deliveries will be required within 30 days of the issuance of each delivery order. Ciprico Inc. is the only known manufacturer of the ruggedized RAIDs that are compatible with the existing hardware and software configurations. Even if a suitable substitute for the Ciprico RAIDs were identified, the necessity to standardize all of the existing Tomahawk Mission Planning Systems to the same configuration would mean excessive logistics expenditures that could not possibly be recouped by competing the existing requirement. The Government will not pay for any information received. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334112. The authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1). The solicitation will be available electronically at www.neco.navy.mil or by written request by letter or telefax (215-697-9738) to FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia Code 02P521. See Note 22.

CONTENT OF PROPOSALS Proposals should be no more than ten (10) pages in length including prices. Proposals must (1) describe offered health care benefits, limitations and exclusions, (2) substantiate the offeror's ability to provide the required administrative services by describing the firm's capabilities and resources, (2) provide at least three past performance references, and (4) provide premium and plan administration prices for each of the five years of the contract.

It is requested that offerors notify the Contracting Officer telephonically to verify submission of their proposal. 8. EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS AND CONTRACT AWARD A.  EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS Proposals will be evaluated to determine (1) which offered insurance plan provides the maximum number and level of benefits to the participants as a whole, (2) whether and how well the offeror can provide the required administrative services, (3) the extent to which the offeror has an acceptable past performance record, and (4) which offer provides the lowest premiums to the government.  Participant payment contributions will be evaluated as part of participant benefits, with low deductible and low co-payments being more advantageous.  The insurance, administrative services, and past performance will be evaluated in descending order of importance and when combined will be more important than the over-all premium price.  However, the premium price will be given increased weight in making the award decision as the other factors of competing proposals become more nearly equal. B. CONTRACT AWARD The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 9.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE COMBINED Synopsis/RFO FOR RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR NUCLEAR ELECTRIC PROPULSION VEHICLE SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their offer. This notice serves as the official amendment to the subject solicitation and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate the Statement of Work as follow: Introduction: The nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) vehicle being studied by the Marshall Space Flight Center has some risks associated with it that are unique to the operation of a nuclear reactor in space, and some that are typical of all spacecraft. The proposed effort will address both these areas. In the context of the effort to be procured, risk is defined as the probability of occurrence of a particular event multiplied by the consequences of that event. In order to address the mechanisms that can be utilized to reduce risk and mitigate consequences, it is necessary to perform Failure Modes and Effects Analyses (FMEA). Tasks: 	1. The contractor shall review existing MSFC hazard tables and develop new ones as needed, especially for unique nuclear hazards.  2. The contractor shall perform preliminary Failure Modes and Effects Analyses (FMEA) of the NEP vehicle systems and subsystems. In order to reduce risk or consequence, the identification of mitigating factors is required.  These factors may be procedures, events or mechanisms, and should be identified in sufficient detail for a preliminary FMEA.   	3. The contractor shall, as the NEP vehicle design becomes mature enough, identify the preliminary designs, analyses, or operational procedures that will mitigate risk and/or consequence of risk for the conduct of a final FMEA. Period of Performance: 	The period of performance is for twelve months. Reporting: 	Weekly status reports will be submitted to the MSFC Program Manager.   In addition, monthly progress reports shall be delivered, which will consist of a mix of narrative and presentation charts. They will summarize the efforts over the reporting period.  In addition, the contractor, through support of the vehicle concept definition team, will report its progress as required by the team. A final narrative report shall be submitted at the completion of the 12-month effort. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to May 6, 2002. Offers shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFO posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS)  and published in FedBizOpps on April 29, 2002.  Documents related to this solicitation will be available over the Internet.  These documents are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR SLOTTED WAVEGUIDE TECHNOLOGY (SWAT)!!

The Radar Systems Program Office for The United States Marine Corps (USMC), Marine Corps System Command (MCSC), Battle Space Management and Air Defense Systems (BMADS) Product Group Directorate is soliciting proposals for the development of slotted waveguide technology toward producing a radar system that utilizes D-Band (1215-1400 MHz) in the detection of multiple targets accurately in range, azimuth, and elevation from a single coherent dwell (mono-pulse).  Sources responding to this request shall provide specific information leading to the research and development of a Slotted Waveguide Technology (mono-pulse phased array) Advanced Development Model (SWaT ADM) that provides the single hit accuracies in azimuth and elevation as identified in the 3-D Long Range Radar (LRR) Operational Requirements Document.  The Slotted Waveguide technology covered by this BAA is not limited to any specific radar system but may include the AN/TPS-59(V)3.  
The development and testing of prototype systems/subsystems to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing a slotted waveguide, mono-pulse phased array approach to meet the Marine Corps? performance requirements shall be a two-phased effort.  Phase I shall consist of build and test activities in order to provide a higher confidence level for Phase II activities.  Phase II is planned as a sole source follow-on effort to the Phase I contractor, that capitalizes on the results of Phase I and shall result in the development and demonstration of a full-scale development model.  Phase II activities shall commence upon successful completion of Phase I activities and the demonstration that the SWaT (mono-pulse phased array approach) meets the Marine Corps? performance requirements.  This BAA covers the activities of Phase I which shall result in a less than full scale (See Note) SWaT ADM that demonstrates RF technology, which employs a slotted waveguide mono-pulse technology that results in single hit accuracy in azimuth, range and elevation in a single dwell commensurate with the threats of the current AN/TPS-59(V)3 radar engages.   
Note:  The less than full scale ADM shall be fully physically dimensioned to demonstrate it meets Marine Corps mobility requirements.  The prototype shall incorporate those subsystems/components required to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology.

The mission of the slotted waveguide mono-pulse phased array system technology is to provide risk reduction in the development of a SWaT ADM as a suitable replacement for current Marine Corps long-range, solid state, three-dimensional (range, bearing and target altitude), ground based surveillance radar which operates in the D band (1215-1400 MHZ) frequency range. The primary components of a current system include a modular, mechanically rotated, phased array antenna, an electronics shelter, a power distribution box and a decoy system. The AN/TPS-59(V)3 operates in three modes: Air Breathing Targets, Theater Ballistic Missile, and Combined.

The three-dimensional (3-D) long-range radar is to be employed by the Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC) with the Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM) in its role as the Anti-air Warfare (AAW) agency of the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS) of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  The 3-D long-range radar is the MAGTF?s primary means of detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting on all aircraft and missiles within the MAGTF?s area of responsibility.  The radar must provide the MACCS with a real-time display of all air activity and must be rugged enough to support a wide range of tactical operations in all types of weather and terrain conditions.

The 3-D long-range radar must provide anti-air Warfare units of the aviation combat element with sufficient advanced warning and target information to allow for threat evaluation and responsive action, including air raid warningof targeted forces and neutralization of the threat.  The radar must provide air controllers with a precise, true air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  The logistical footprint of the radar system must be reduced as technology permits.  Downsizing is the key to improved transportability and reduced setup time.  In the case of TMD operations, the radar must have the capability, in the interim, to disseminate target information to the ADCP and, in the near agencies (Marine Corps and Joint Services) and Surface to Air Missile (SAM) firing batteries (Marine Corps and Joint Services) by the way of a common digital data link.  The mature system must provide target information to the Marine Corps SAM system.  The radar must contribute to the MAGTF?s ability to integrate air defense assets, both with the Marine Corps and across a joint interface.  In support of its TMD role, the sensor must improve target processing capabilities and improve survivability.

Offerors are encouraged to use teaming to leverage existing production programs.  Offerors must understand and have experience with the USMC operational environment including the detection and tracking of complex theater ballistic missiles.  The Offeror must have secure facilities for working with classified information and fabricating classified hardware and software up to the secret level. The Three Dimensional Long Range Radar Operational Requirements Document (Number CCC 11.6) and MIL-R-29466D (dated 15 April, 2000) system specification for the United States Marine Corps Radar Set, AN/TPS-59(V)3 shall be available for viewing at Northrop Grumman Information Technologies, 2848 Jefferson Davis Highway, Suite 102, Stafford, Virginia 22554 between the hours of 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM during the effective period of this announcement.  NO REPRODUCTIONS OF ANY DOCUMENTS SHALL BE MADE AVAILABLE.  Security clearances can be forwarded to Ms. Sharon Carr, Security Officer, voice (540) 657-5165, fax (540) 657-4439, email scarr@logicon.com.  

The Government reserves the right to select one, more than one, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement via a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  The value of the expected firm-fixed price contract award is approximately $5,700,000, to include any GFP and Government Facilities.  No award can be made without a proposal to perform a specific research effort within an estimated cost and time framework. The offeror selected to demonstrate its Slotted waveguide mono-pulse technology may or may not eventually be selected to be the developer or production contractor for the slotted waveguide mono-pulse technology systems.

<DESC>Title:  Independent Systems Engineering and Acquisition Support for Air Force Institute for Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health Risk Analysis  (AFIERA)

The Air Force intends to negotiate under the authority of FAR6.302-3 an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity task order contract with Mitretek Systems, Inc., McLean, VA,  a nonprofit, conflict-of-interest free organization.  A justification for other than full and open competition has been proposed for this procurement. The contractor shall provide independent system engineering and acquisition support (ISE&AS) services to AFIERA by assisting  AFIERA in carrying out its mission to enhance AF mission effectiveness, protect health, improve readiness and reduce costs.  The contractor shall provide the ISE&AS services by providing strategic  planning; contractor and industry oversight; scientific, technical, and engineering evaluations and technology transfer; program integration, and acquisition support.  Additionally the contractor shall support areas such as assessing and managing biological, chemical, radiological and operational risks; support readiness and operational analysis; assisting the biological, chemical, and radiological assessment teams and the theater epidemiology team; conducting health risk assessments, developing health standards criteria; supporting deployment surveillance activities; assisting with AFIERA ATSDR public health assessment process activities, health studies, health education, and toxicological profiles; supporting environmental health engineering  activities; assuring the quality of the work of other contactors; and conducting scientific, technical, and engineering studies.  This procurement will be subject to stringent organizational conflict-of-interest provisions and respondents must demonstrate an absence of such conflicts .  That is, the respondent is not engaged in other activities or relationships, which would make the respondent unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or would otherwise impair the respondent?s objectivity in performing the contract work , or  would give the respondent  an unfair competitive advantage.  In order to assure this freedom from potential conflict-of-interest, the contractor must, at a minimum, be a nonprofit organization that does not formally compete for business in the government marketplace. The resultant contract performance period will be a 3-year base period with two one-year options.  This office believes that Mitretek fulfills all of AFIERA?s requirement for this procurement.   If any responsible source other than Mitretek Systems, Inc. can fulfill all of the above requirements, written notification and supporting documentation may be submitted in writing to:  311 HSW/PKOM, Attn:  Ms. Cheryl Brown, 2513 Kennedy Circle, Room 117, Brooks AFB, TX  78235-5116.  To be considered a viable source, documentation must clearly demonstrate:  (1) freedom from actual or potential conflict-of-interest to include being a nonprofit organization that does not formally compete for business in the government marketplace, (2) extensive knowledge of and experience in the following areas:  (a) strategic planning, (b) industry and contractor oversight and quality assurance, (c) scientific, technical and engineering evaluations and technology transfer, (d) program integration, and (e) acquisition support; (3) extensive experience in the independent analysis and evaluation of solicitations and proposals, (4) capability to provide independent, conflict free review and assessment of contractor products/services, (5) past history detailing any contracts that your company is currently performing or have completed that would be considered the same or similar to the type of services described above (include the contract number, type of contract, dollar value, performance location, contract length, government point of contact and current phone number), (6) positive indication that your firm does not compete or bid for work contemplated under this announcement.   If no affirmative written documentation is received within 15 calendar days of this synopsis, 311 HSW will proceed with negotiations to issue a contract to Mitretek Systems, Inc.  A solicitation is not available.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is seeking sources to provide data support and programming for the Division of Epidemiology, Statistics, and Prevention Research (DESPR).  DESPR conducts epidemiological, behavioral, and biostatistical research of disorders of reproduction including infertility, high-risk pregnancies, fetal and neonatal loss, infant and childhood injury, infant mortality and birth defects, and developmental disorders of childhood, including mental retardation and other deviations of normal human growth and development.  The scope of the research program also includes studies of clinical nutrition and infant feeding practices; contraceptive practice and safety; clinical trials of new diagnostic techniques or therapy dealing with the recognition of fetal and neonatal disorders and management, including diagnosis and fetal monitoring.  Also included is identifying determinants of health behavior and developing and testing educational, behavioral, and environmental strategies to improve or protect maternal, child, and adolescent health.  The Division currently is composed of Epidemiologists and Statisticians and Social Scientists.  There is collaboration on many of the research projects, and the majority of the staff are involved in multiple research efforts.  This staff requires statistical programming, database management and file handling, ad hoc programming and data entry  to complete their research projects in a timely fashion.  Examples of the current work load include but are not limited to:  NICHD-Irish neural tube defects study, Declining sperm count: autopsy study, and Determinants of fecundity, fertility and early pregnancy loss.

<CONTACT>Billy Lemley, (256) 955-4985
<DESC>NA This special announcement for Systems Analysis, Integration, and Technical Assistance (SAITAC) services has three purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the business community in the Head Quarters Department of the Army (HQDA) G8, Force Devel opment Directorate competition at the prime contractor level, (2) to roughly gauge the capability of those interested small business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level, and (3) to obtain the expressions of interest from all b usinesses in further discussions.  The associated evaluations discussed in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firms or teams ability to perform; that evaluation will be part of the formal source selection process. The government is anticipating that one of the multiple awards resulting from this requirement will be set-aside for Small Business.  Small businesses may now team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award of a set-aside contract, providing th at each team member meets the NAICS code small business definition.  Prior to the rule change, a contracting officer could set aside an acquisition when there was an expectation of two or more competitive offers from small business prime contractors who wo uld perform at least 50% of the work.  The new rules allow a set-aside when there is an expectation of two or more competitive offers from small business teams when at least 50% of the services will be performed by the collective efforts of all small busin ess members of the team.  Further, the new SBA 8(a) affiliation rules allow joint ventures or teams when each team member is small according to the applicable NAICS Code and the 8(a) concern performs a significant amount of the work with its own employee s.  Such teams and/or joint ventures require the prior approval of the SBA.  Small Businesses should note the FAR 19  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code and size standard for the SAITAC is 54171/1000 employees.   The contractors will be expected to provide non-personal services for systems engineering and technical assistance in support of the Mission and Function Statements for the U.S. Army G8 Force Development Directorate in Washington, DC and other associated l ocations.  This support is both broad ranging and ever changing.  The SAITAC scope of work (SOW) has four functional areas:  Technology and Systems Integration and Synchronization, Studies and Analyses, Systems Testing and Training Support, and Project Man agement and Programmatic Support.  This acquisition will result in multiple awards with identical SOWs and numbers of person-hours.  The contracts will consist of fixed-price labor categories and cost reimbursable travel and materials line items.   The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other  proposing teams).  Further, we do not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award.  The resultant contracts will contain a contract specific Non-Disclosure Agreement as well as an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful offeror from participating in any other U.S. Army G8 Force Development contracts.  All contractor personnel will be required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Governmen ts interests, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contractors actual SAITAC performance.  Any business firms, including small and/or 8(a) firms, intending to propose as a prime contractor (especially those planning to use the new affiliation and teaming rules issued by the SBA) are invited to submit a capability package to the Government (limit ed to 8 pages).  Note:  The capability package should address the skills and capabilities necessary to perform this requirement not the general attributes of the company.   Interested firms should submit their package to the Government within 10 days after the date of this announcement to: USASMDC, SMDC-CM-CS , ATTN:  Billy Lemley, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL  35807-3801 or e-mail: billy.lemley@smdc.army.mil.  The package should be entitled SAITAC Capability Package.   The capability package should focus on: (1) the breadth and depth of technical and management expertise to successfully execute the SAITAC roles, (2) the capability to quickly ramp up qualified and trained personnel at the onset of the contract, (3) the ca pability to administer and manage an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, task order contract (expected as a minimum to be $25M per year for the total program) with numerous subcontractors, (4) assurance that the small business firm or small business t eam, if applicable, will perform 50% of the work, (5) capability to perform realistic cost and schedule projections for complex technical and integration efforts, (6) a contract management structure that allows for an integrated organization accountable fo r total performance responsibility, and (7) an understanding of Army, DoD, and Government Agencies with whom HQDA G8, Force Development Directorate interfaces. This acquisition is not open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.

<DESC>INTENT TO NEGOTIATE FOR A 10 YEAR LEASE OF APPROXIMATELY 34,000 RENTABLE SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE AND RELATED SPACE INCLUDING 200 OUTSIDE PARKING SPACES.

The General Services Administration announces that it intends to negotiate a sole source procurement for a 10 year lease that includes approximately 34,000 rentable square feet of office and related space including 200 surface parking spaces.  GSA plans to negotiate one lease agreement with the lessor of the Valley Office Building, located at 1801 Lind Avenue, West Building, Renton, Washington for both "Temporary Space" and "Permanent Space" on a prime lease.  Temporary space includes the north 7,000 square feet of the 1st floor of the West Building effective May 1, 2002 and would be vacated upon moving into the Permanent Space, estimated to be November 1, 2002.  The permanent space includes the entire 2nd floor and a portion of the 1st floor of the North Building effective November 1, 2002.  The Permanent Space would total approximately 34,000 rentable square feet and would be for a 10-year term.  The primary tenant agency has determined that the space requirement needs to be within a 4-minute walk, or no more than 800 feet from their current location at 1601 Lind Avenue SW, Renton, Washington 98055-4099 in order to accommodate their mission related mandate.

<SUBJECT>J -- MAINTENANCE OF PHYSICAL ELECTRNICS'' ESCA 5702 SYSTEM
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE - The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  (NIOSH) laboratory facility in Morgantown, WV purchased an ESCA 5702 System in 1995.  The government desires to provide continued maintenance for this instrument and intends to negotiate on a sole-source  basis with the equipment manufacturer, Physical Electronics, Eden Prairie, MN.  Physical Electronics will provide continued maintenance including annual preventative maintenance and up to six on-site emergency visits by a qualified Service Engineer, with parts, excluding consumables, replaced at Physical Electonics' expense.  The contract also includes all optic repairs at Physical Electronics' expenses and optic rebuilds at one-half the current labor rates.  The agreement includes free use of loaner or exchange programs, no cost technical telephone support, a guaranteed five day response time and factory repair services.  We are not aware of any other vendor that could provide the necessary support because the source codes and the dimensional drawings and documentation of PHI parts necessary for servicing the 5702 are proprietary.  If there are interested parties who believe they can provide the required services, they may fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 7 days from the date of this announcement. The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any sources exist, therefore, no RFP is available. Any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned stated data, but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will not be honored.   Information shall be submitted to: Brenda L. Goodwin, Reference: #HELD02E0036, DHHS, PHS, CDC,  NIOSH, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505  (Phone: 304/285-5882). This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000. This notice is  issued for informational purposes only.
