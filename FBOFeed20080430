<DESC><p>Air Force Research Laboratory, Propulsion Directorate (AFRL/PKPA) solicits input for the Integrated Vehicle Energy Technology Demonstration (INVENT) Program. It is anticipated that INVENT will be performed by two platform teams working in competition in Phase 1. It is also anticipated that each team would be led by an airframer and supported by multiple utility subsystem, vehicle system and engine suppliers together in an Integrated Product and Process Development (IPPD) setting. This effort will design, develop and ground test an integrated suite of energy, power, and thermal advanced technologies based on the INVENT consensus architecture. This effort will consist of critical subsystems and vehicle system technology integrations and demonstrations that ameliorate the risks identified by the INVENT consensus architecture studies. Component technology development work will be done outside of this effort. The three critical INVENT subsystem demonstrations identified are defined as 1. Adaptive Power &amp; Thermal Management System, 2. Robust Electrical Power System, and 3. High Performance Electric Actuation System. Integrated designs shall be developed using high fidelity modeling and simulation techniques at an air system level to validate the approach achieves the expected benefits identified by the INVENT consensus architecture study. Installed benefits as well as performance oriented capabilities enhancements will be evaluated throughout the course of the program to show a solid transition path to the contractor's chosen platform. Each contractor team shall pick a single platform as the basis for their effort from the INVENT near term portfolio (subsonic LRS, UAV, or Tactical). Risk based planning will encompass ground testing through engine integration and flight test. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.</p>

<DESC>This notice is prosted as part of the draft solicitation process for the KC-135 ATS Acquisition Team to acquire additional BOWST systems.  
	This will be a follow-on supply (not services) acquisition. Initial development and delivery of the first two BOWST systems is being accomplished by the 12th Trainer Development Engineering team at Randolph AFB, Texas (AETC).  
	The Air Force has identified funding for one additional unit in the Fiscal Year 2008 cycle (BOWST unit #3) to be installed at the McConnell AFB KC-135 ATS site.  Options for up to eight additional units (i.e., BOWST units 4 through 11) may be described in the final prospective RFP, but funding for additional units may or may not materialize by FY2010.  Units 4-11 will be installed at other KC-135 ATS CONUS and OCONUS sites to be named later.

Operator interface, aero package modeling, control loading and aural implementations must be carried out so as to embody accurate representations of the real world.  The BOWST 1 and 2 design criteria packages (data) will be made available during the RFP process, including all aero and control loading, and aural models and software.   The Air Force cannot guarantee that the data can be relied upon as to accuracy, completeness or suitability as the sole standard for satisfying the functional and performance requirements of this prospective acquisition.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) intends to issue a solicitation in support of efforts to determine and summarize the types of possible stored energy sources for currently available and emerging communication, tracking, and atmospheric monitoring systems (AMS), along with a list of recommendations, procedures, and guidelines on which stored energy sources need to be de-energized and which ones do not, based on the type and location of the mine emergency. There is a need to review reports on recent mine disasters, mine emergencies, and other abnormal circumstances (e.g., 1990 - now) with particular focus on stored energy hazards and how such hazards could be minimized under such conditions. Review and compare any standards associated with stored energy hazards in underground and surface mines. Develop a list of the manufacturers and distributors of currently available communication and/or tracking equipment. For each manufacturer&rsquo;s product examine and summarize the types and roles of possible stored energy sources and identify and evaluate potential safety risks associated with the following &ndash; batteries, cables, capacitors, backup power sources, line power, etc. The Institute anticipates that the period of performance for this effort will be one (1) year. Request for Proposal No. 2008-N-10422 will be issued restricted to small businesses only. The solicitation will be available on or about May 8, 2008, and proposals due by June 24, 2008.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Current military
operations are focusing efforts on urban and asymmetric warfare, as well as
distributed operations, but </span>small unit leaders lack the capability to
issue commands and share mission-relevant information in an urban environment non-line-of-sight.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Various factors that can impact mission
effectiveness and tempo of operations are:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">leaders
     communicate by shouting and hand signals,</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">teams operate

<li class="MsoNormal">intra-squad
     radios are hard to hear, and</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">leaders
     must stop to use handheld displays. </li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">Military operations in the urban terrain (extensive areas
with hostile forces, non-combatant populations, and complex infrastructure)
require special capabilities and agility to conduct close-combat operations
under highly dynamic, adverse conditions.<span>&nbsp; </span>In short, tactical leaders need the ability to adapt on the move,
coordinate small unit actions and execute commands across a wider area of
engagement.<span>&nbsp; </span>Significant tactical
advantages could be realized through the small unit leader&rsquo;s ability to intuitively
generate/route commands and timely actionable combat information to the
appropriate team or individual warfighter in a readily understood format that
avoids information overload.<strong> </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thus, the goal of the ULTRA-Vis program is to<strong> </strong>enable the small unit commander to
disseminate commands and <em>actionable
combat information</em> over a wider area to support distributed, non-linear,
operations.<span>&nbsp; </span>To accomplish this goal, the
ULTRA-Vis program will be focused on:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">developing
     information processing techniques to recognize/interpret a small unit
     leader&rsquo;s gesture/ voice commands, </li>
<li class="MsoNormal">develop
     techniques to create/disseminate/display geo-registered icons and
     actionable combat information for Fire Team Leaders/Dismount Warfighters
     in real time over an existing soldier radio network, and </li>
<li class="MsoNormal">developing/integrating
     the necessary critical enabling technologies, such as 1) a low profile,
     see-through display, and 2) demonstrating multi-modal iconic C2 in a NLOS,
     urban environment with prototype systems. </li>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for repair services of nine radio components with various estimated annual quantities.  Motorola, acquired by General Dynamics Decision Systems (GDDS), was the original manufacturer of these radio components.  This radio equipment is required for use in air to ground communication systems.  An indefinite delivery/requirements type contract for one year with options to renew for four additional 1-year periods is contemplated.
GDDS is the only known responsible source of supply for repair services, since they have proprietary rights to the original design and technical data.  The FAA does not have the technical data needed to provide to any other vendor.  
Any concern desiring to become a source for FAA repair requirements is requested to provide a complete documentation package to the contracting officer, FAA, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, NAS Acquisition Contracting Team, AMQ-210, P.O. Box 25082, 6500 S. MacArthur Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK, 73125-4929.  The documentation must clearly demonstrate that the concern has ownership or legal access to required original equipment manufacturer documentation, test bed facility, and copies of the test procedures, specifications and equipment listings applicable to the item as well as access to replacement parts necessary to effect the repairs.  
Any information received as a result of this market survey will not be for use outside the Government but solely for the purpose of determining whether an additional source may be approved for the repair of the radio components.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.  This market survey shall not be construed as a request for proposal or an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Responders to this market survey may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Portland, Oregon, has a requirement to purchase native grass seed to revegetate burned lands, reduce erosion on burned areas, and to compete with/prevent the establishment of invasive grasses and other noxious and invasive plant species on approximately 26,206 acres of burned lands. These acres are at risk of permanent degradation due to fire severity. It is necessary to acquire seed that has the best chance of germinating to achieve rehabilitation goals.  Plant material requirements are as follows:"	Native seed will be required to be source identified. "	The source for native plant material should be Hanford/Pasco or Columbia Basin Ecoregion derived, and grown in the Columbia Basin. Seeds must have their origin in this area, unless otherwise cleared through the USFWS."	Seed will be certified "weed free", indicating there are no noxious weeds in the seed."	Seed should be based on Pure Live Seed (PLS) per pound, based upon purity and germination testing."	All grass species provided through this contract will be from the harvest year of 2007 & 2008 and shrub species from the harvest year of 2007-2008 or 2008-2009.  All seed will be required to have been tested within 120 days of sale for purity, germination and noxious weed content. Seed certification tag without testing documentation will not be accepted.   Inert matter will not exceed 10%"	Quoted prices are to include shipping and handling costs (FOB Hanford Reach National Monument/Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge, Richland, WA), mixing, and seed test costs."	Substitute species may be accepted IF approved by USFWS prior to bid submission. Some species or cultivars may be modified to meet pounds of seed desired with approval by the staff of the Monument.  However, bidders should at least be generally confident that they can meet the desired quantities of each species (within +/- 1000 pounds) before making any substitutions.Packaged seed (50 lb sacks) will be delivered on or before October 27, 2008.  Pricing shall be FOB destination to the Hanford Reach National Monument/Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge, Richland, WA.  Delivery of seed will be to the point of aerial application for all bulk sacks.  Final delivery of bulk seed will be negotiated between the USFWS and selected vendor. Delivery of seed is required no later than December 1, 2008.  FOB point is the Hanford Reach National Monument/Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge, Richland, WA, Benton County.  Actual delivery dates for bulk seed will be based upon local weather conditions and anticipated start dates of aerial application operations.  Delivery locations will be at or near government facilities on the Monument.Successful bidder will be required to provide proof of test results for seed lots included in this order that will document lot purity, germination, percent weed content, percent of inert matter and certification that seed is free from noxious weeds.  Failure to provide certification will result in refusal of delivery and payment. Evaluation and acceptance will be determined by the Technical Coordinator(s) and/or Refuge Manager(s).  Handling and unloading services will be provided by selected vendor in coordination with the USFWS.  Anticipate the award of one firm-fixed price contract from this requirement.  This will be a "best value" procurement with award based on technical approach, past performance/organization, personnel qualifications/ experience and price.  Evaluations factors as a whole are more important than price; however, between proposals that are evaluated as equal, price to the Government will be a major selection factor.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Portland, Oregon, has a requirement to purchase native grass seed to revegetate burned lands, reduce erosion on burned areas, and to compete with/prevent the establishment of invasive grasses and other noxious and invasive plant species on approximately 16,417 acres of burned lands. These acres are at risk of permanent degradation due to fire severity. It is necessary to acquire seed that has the best chance of germinating to achieve rehabilitation goals.  Plant material requirements are as follows:"	Native seed will be required to be "source identified". "	The source for native plant material should be Hanford/Pasco Basin or Columbia Basin Ecoregion derived, and grown in the Columbia Basin. Seeds must have their origin in this area, unless otherwise cleared through the USFWS."	Seed will be certified "weed free", indicating there are no noxious weeds in the seed."	Seed should be based on pure live seed (PLS) per pound, based upon purity and germination testing."	All grass species provided through this contract will be from the harvest year of 2007 & 2008 and shrub species from the harvest year of 2007-2008 or 2008-2009.  All seed will be required to have been tested within 120 days of sale for purity, germination and noxious weed content. Seed certification tag without testing documentation will not be accepted.   Inert matter will not exceed 10%"	Quoted prices are to include shipping and handling costs (FOB Hanford Reach National Monument/Saddle Mountain NWR, Richland, WA), mixing, and seed test costs."	Substitute species may be accepted IF approved by USFWS prior to bid submission. Some species or cultivars may be modified to meet pounds of seed desired with approval by the staff of the Monument.  However, bidders should at least be generally confident that they can meet the desired quantities of each species (within +/- 1000 pounds) before making any substitutions.Packaged seed (50 lb sacks) will be delivered on or before October 27, 2008.  Pricing shall be FOB destination to the Hanford Reach National Monument/Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge, Richland, WA.  Delivery of seed will be to the point of aerial application for all bulk sacks.  Final delivery of bulk seed will be negotiated between the USFWS and selected vendor. Delivery of seed is required no later than December 1, 2008.  FOB point is the Hanford Reach National Monument/Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge, Richland, WA, Benton County.  Actual delivery dates for bulk seed will be based upon local weather conditions and anticipated start dates of aerial application operations.  Delivery locations will be at or near government facilities on the Monument.Successful bidder will be required to provide proof of test results for seed lots included in this order that will document lot purity, germination, percent weed content, percent of inert matter and certification that seed is free from noxious weeds.  Failure to provide certification will result in refusal of delivery and payment. Evaluation and acceptance will be determined by the Technical Coordinator(s) and/or Refuge Manager(s).  Handling and unloading services will be provided by selected vendor in coordination with the USFWS.  Anticipate the award of one firm-fixed price contract from this requirement.  This will be a "best value" procurement with award based on technical approach, past performance/organization, personnel qualifications/ experience and price.  Evaluations factors as a whole are more important than price; however, between proposals that are evaluated as equal, price to the Government will be a major selection factor. Solicitation number: 101818R501 may be viewed thru a link to the National Business Center Interior Electronic Acquisition System-Electronic Commerce at "http://www.fedbizopps.gov" or "http://www.nbc.gov".

<DESC>This is a PRESOLICITATION NOTICE to announce the anticipated release of the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) solicitation for Enterprise System Life Cycle Management Support (ELMS) on, or about, May 15th, 2008. 

The objective of the contract for Enterprise System Life Cycle Management Support (ELMS) services procurement provides for the performance of information technology (IT) support, IT service support and IT support management services for planning, design, development, testing, implementation, operations and maintenance for FDAs automated systems and business application software that integrate hardware, software, data and communication technologies.    

The purpose of the ELMS contract is to acquire planning, design, development, testing, implementation, operations coordination and maintenance for the Food and Drug Administrations automated systems and business application software.  These systems and software packages integrate hardware, software, data and communication services.  

The FDA recognizes that no single contractor may be capable of providing the full range of goods and services called for under this contract. Therefore, FDA encourages where appropriate, the teaming of contractors and vendors with specific related expertise under a single ELMS contractor.  Pursuant to FAR Parts 15 & 16.5, FDA anticipates the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts to support ELMS.  The solicitation contemplates a 10 year ordering period.  

The Contracting Officer has determined that a portion of the acquisition shall be set-aside for small business in accordance with FAR 19.502-3. FDA intends to implement a partial small business set aside by pursuing a two-tiered approach. Under a two-tiered approach, the first tier would consist of approximately three awards to large businesses, with the second tier consisting of awards to approximately six small businesses. With each new request for task order proposal, first consideration would be to specifically set aside the requirement for small business, given the ability of small businesses to perform the work, which would greatly depend on the scope, size and complexity of the task and the specialized capabilities of the pool of small business awardees. Small businesses would have full opportunity to propose on all tasks, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.

The solicitation will be made available on www.fbo.gov. 

Questions or comments must be submitted IN WRITING to Janet Herman at janet.herman@fda.hhs.gov and Sherry Solodkova at sherry.solodkova@fda.hhs.gov. Phone calls will NOT be accepted.

Thank you for your interest in the ELMS.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Pathology (LP), plans to procure on a sole source basis; immunohistochemical and in situ-hybridization staining reagents and supplies from Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.; 3865 North Business Center Drive; Tucson, AZ 85705. 
The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.5.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

The Laboratory of Pathology has a need to provide immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization reagents requested by both the diagnostic services and research laboratories within the LP.  These stains/reagents have become an essential part of cancer diagnosis and have an equally important role in the diagnosis of many infectious diseases.
The reagents shall be used for diagnostic immunohistochemistry laboratory clinical use, as well as for supporting clinical and basic research in the LP and other NIH laboratories.  These reagents shall be used on several automated immunostaining/in situ-hybridization systems (i.e. Ventana ES, NexES, Benchmark and Discovery systems) that the laboratory has purchased from Ventana Medical Systems under previous contracts. 

Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. is the only source known to NCI that can provide the reagents and supplies that are required to operate the Ventana automated immunostainers/in situ-hybridization Ventana ES, NexES, Benchmark and Discovery systems. The reagents are proprietary to Ventana Medical.  The current clinical standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been developed over many years using Ventana equipment and reagents.  Changing variables/systems at this time will be detrimental to both patient care and to the current research being performed in the laboratory.  Without the reagents, the existing automated systems cannot be used. 

Period of Performance shall be for a base year of twelve (12) months from date of award with four (4) one (1) year option periods.  In addition, this is a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract.  Only one (1) award will be made as a result of this notice.

This is not a request for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above supplies, it may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above specifications described herein. Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 11:00 AM ET on May 12, 2008. If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax - (301) 402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.
In order to receive and award, contractors must have current registration/certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) http://orca.bpn.gov.  Please reference NCI-80069-NG on all correspondence.

<CONTACT>Sharon L Cummings, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 435-0352, Fax (301) 480-3345, Email cummings@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC><p>It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Suburban Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland to extend the existing research collaboration between NHLBI and Suburban Hospital for acute cardiac patients.  The purpose of this program is to continue a collaborative research program between the Hospital and NIH to study the use of MRI in the clinical evaluation of acute cardiac patients.  Since 1999, NHLBI has been collaborating with Suburban Hospital to develop MRI techniques and apply these methods to patients with acute presentations of ischemic heart disease.  The Hospital will be able to refer &gt; 150 hospitalized patients per year for cardiovascular MRI studies.  It is believed that Suburban Hospital is the sole source for this program under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the following reasons:  Since the requirement aims to continue use of an existing MRI scanner, facility and office space at Suburban Hospital, the large capital costs of building a new facility at a different location and purchasing a new MRI scanner can be avoided.  In addition, the existing program has developed significant referral networks that would have to be replaced in a new hospital.  Also, since one goal of this program is to evaluate acutely ill patients, the proximity of the Hospital to NIH is critical to permit clinical and engineering staff to respond to acute patient issues in a timely fashion from the NIH site.  The on-call NIH professional staff at the NIH Clinical Center will also provide the specialized clinical coverage for off-hour studies.  The Hospital will be able to provide 24 hour MRI technology support for the facility.    Based on the clinical requirements of the acute cardiac patient, the hospital shall be located within 5 minutes driving time or 10 minutes by foot from the NIH Bethesda, Maryland campus.  This is to assure that no acute patient will need to wait for proper physician coverage or technical support for a MRI procedure as well as assure a good working relationship between the Hospital and NIH staff.  Thus, Suburban Hospital is a unique environment for the primary reason of the continuation of an existing program.  The period of performance will be for one twelve (12) month period, with options to renew for three additional twelve (12) month periods.  Any competing hospital that believes it is capable of providing the above facility is invited to submit sufficient documentation to demonstrate that capability to the Contract Specialist.  See Numbered Note 22.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to Med-Eng Systems Incorporated, 2400 Saint-Laurent Boulevard, Ottawa, ON K1G 6C4 for the fabrication of four prototype hot water diving suits to support Swimmer Delivery Vehicle (SDV) divers. The Navy is conducting an R&D, T&E effort to provide the SDV divers with substantially better cold protection.  The Navy is investigating providing these divers with suits that contain tubes that circulate warm water that will provide a high level of warmth and mission enhancement, each diver will have his own independently controlled system.  Since the SDV is a small portable underwater vehicle, the hot water systems must be fully self controlled, portable, small, reliable and of low weight.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Med-Eng Systems has been providing Liquid Circulating Garments (LCG) to various Military Organizations (e.g., US Navy), Government Agencies (e.g., NASA), and Academic Research Institutions (e.g., University at Buffalo) for the past 15 years. They continue to be the leader in customized LCG tubesuits for use in human thermoregulation research and temperature control systems (both heating and cooling).   similar to the one presented in this Statement Of Work (SOW).  Prior research and testing efforts showing feasibility of hydrogen catalytic heater have been successfully conducted with Med-Eng garments which were specially designed for high through-put flow rates.  Once acquired, these prototype systems, quantity four (4), will undergo NEDU testing for suitability, safety, performance, and ease of operation.  If these suits are found suitable, additional field testing may be performed by the Government.  In summary these hot-water dive systems manufactured by Med-Eng Systems are the only systems that will meet the U.S. Navy needs.  Award will be based on the written quotation. A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated. Anticipated award date will be on or about 16 May 2008. FSC code is 4220, NAICS Code 339999 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees.

<DESC>The Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED), Washington, DC, requires a resilience promotion program to support and build resiliency within the Military family and provide better access and continuity of psychological health care for families across the armed services.  The Defense Health Board Task Force on Mental Health has identified military families and children as a high risk group due to the prevalence of multiple wartime separations, combat-related post traumatic stress or other health conditions, and combat-related physical injury or loss.  
This requirement will is divided into two phases and will provide evaluation and development of best practices for resilience promotion to the families of Marines assigned to the Wounded Warrior Regiment (including the service members).  This program also intends to improve access to care, quality of care, and transition of care among DOD, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and local health care providers, as well as evaluation and development of best practices for surveillance. 
Phase One of the contract will serve as a resiliency promotion pilot program developed through actual provision of services by the contractor to 60 families identified by the Government in order to insure an effective and problem-free launching of this program to Wounded Warriors and their families worldwide.  This program will include assessment and provision of services to a minimum of 20 wounded warriors and their families who reside in the San Diego area and can meet together with a family educator.  Approximately 20 wounded warriors and their families who live in the same household but not in the San Diego area, and who will receive workshops via videoconferencing; and approximately 20 wounded warriors who are geographically separated from the their families, and where videoconferencing workshops will join these families together to help improve family functioning.  The contract will result in the initial evaluation and development of best practices for resilience promotion to the covered Service members and their families.  
Phase Two of the contract will serve as a resiliency promotion program based on the pilot program described in Phase One.  It will be developed through actual provision of services by the contractor to any family identified by the Government as eligible due to their involvement with the Wounded Warrior Regiment.  It is estimated that Phase Two will reach up to 5,000 wounded warriors and their families worldwide.  Phase Two of the contract will result in the continued evaluation and refinement and further development of best practices for resilience promotion to the covered Service members and their families.  
The total duration of all required services shall not exceed twelve (12) months.
This is a sole source action to be awarded as a new contract to Research Triangle Institute International (RTI International).  RTI is the only firm who can supply the required services for the acquisition.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).  
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.

<a href="mailto:KIMBLE.JOY@EPA.GOV">BRENDA J. KIMBLE</a>
<DESC>The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement to provide ambient air sampling and analysis support for air toxics and ozone precursor programs.  Air toxics ambient monitoring support is provided under the Urban Air Toxics Monitoring Program (UATMP) and is available to state, local, and tribal agencies to include, but not limited to, National Air Toxics Trends Station (NATTS) and Community-Scale Air Toxics Ambient Monitoring (CSATAM) program participants.
The ozone precursor monitoring support is available to Photochemical Atmospheric Measurement Station (PAMS) and Non-Methane Organic Compound (NMOC) program participants.  This support includes VOC and carbonyl analysis, automated and manual gas chromatography operation, quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) program development, standards preparation and certification, data reduction and validation, and on site technical assistance.

This will include, but not limited to, system optimization, standard operating procedures (SOP) development, and quality assurance/quality control activities.  Additionally, there is a requirement to provide centralized logisitical support for participating agencies in areas of site selection and sampler set up, canister tracking and cleaning, standard materials development and supply, and sample and standards confirmation analysis.  The following information regarding the number of sites is relevant for the performance period (consisting of 5 years):  
The UATMP was initiated in 1988 as an analytical/technical support program focused on ascertaining ambient air levels of organic toxic species.  The UATMP initially involved about 20 state and local agencies and supported the collection and analysis of a 24-hour canister sample every 12 days for a 12 month period.  The program has since expanded to provide for the measurement of additional Clean Air Act Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) such as carbonyls, PM10 metals, and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), and the standard sample collection frequency has increased to 1 in 6 days.  Among the driving forces for these program changes is the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA).  As required under the GPRA, the EPA has developed a Strategic Plan that includes a goal for the Clean Air. 
Under this goal, there is an objective to improve air quality and reduce air toxic emissions to levels 75 percent below 1993 levels by 2010 in order to reduce the risk to Americans of cancer and other serious adverse health affects caused by airborne toxics.  While there originally was no national network or systematic program for air toxics ambient monitoring, such a program now exists and is comprised of two separate and distinct components for which UATMP support is available and often used; these programs are described below.
The National Air Toxics Trends Station (NATTS) Network was established during 2003 and 2004 and is intended for long term operation for the principle purpose of discerning national trends.  The original NATTS Network consisted of 23 sites, 16 urban and 7 rural.  Two urban sites were added in 2007 and three more were added in 2008 bringing the total number of NATTS to 28.  Over 100 HAPs are measured on a 1 in 6 day sampling schedule and include VOCs, carbonyls, PM10 metals, hexavalent chromium and PAHs.  
The Community-Scale Air Toxics Ambient Monitoring (CSATAM) Program was initiated in 2004 and is intended to support state, local, and tribal agencies in conducting discreet, investigative projects of approximately two-year durations.  Projects are selected from periodic (1 to 2 year cycle) grant competitions; the intended objectives include identifying and profiling air toxics sources, developing and assessing emerging measurement methods, characterizing the degree and extent of local air toxics problems, and tracking progress of air toxics reduction activities.
The contractor shall be responsible for providing support for the programs described above.  Note that the NMOC program is applicable to those moderate and marginal non-attainment areas for ozone which do not require PAMS.  The NMOC program is limited to the summer ozone season while the UATMP and PAMS programs are year-round.
A base contract of five years (no option periods) is anticipated with pricing schedules for each of the five years.  A cost-plus-fixed-fee requirements type contract is anticipated.  
NAICS code 541380 applies, with a size standard of $11M in average annual receipts.  This requirement is a follow-on to contract number 68D03049 with Eastern Research Group which will expire 09/30/08.  The solicitation is expected to be issued on/about 05/30/08 as a full and open competition.  Proposal will be due approximately thirty days after issuance of the solicitation.  The solicitation and amendments will be available  at http://epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  
Firms are encouraged to access the solicitation and amendments at this web site.   It will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site for the solicitation and any amendments.  Hard copies or disketts will not be made available.  Telephone and FAX requests will not be honored.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency if received timely.

<CONTACT>Jennifer D Kroan, Contract Negotiator/Attorney, Phone 202/633-7275, Fax 202/633-7305, Email kroanj@si.edu
<DESC>The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is seeking a contractor to provide professional audio information technology services for a pilot audio tour project for the Smithsonian American Art Museums (SAAM) Luce Foundation Center for American Art. The purpose of the pilot is to test one or two technology solutions for the Luce Centers audio information needs, evaluate the service with the public, and gather data and experience for designing a more permanent audio information solution for the Luce Center and other areas of the Museum, including its exhibitions and permanent collection spaces. The Museum is interested in receiving proposals that utilize visitors own devices, such as cell phones, as well as mobile devices that would be distributed by Museum staff from the Luce Centers information desk.

The Luce Foundation Center for American Art is a visible storage facility within SAAM that displays around 3,300 objects from the Museums collection on 3 levels. The Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallerytwo museums that tell America's stories through art, history and biographyshare a National Historic Landmark building, now known as the Donald W. Reynolds Center, in downtown Washington D.C.  The objects in the Luce Foundation Center include 18th-21st century paintings and sculpture, folk art, and contemporary craft that are displayed in 57 floor-to-ceiling glass cases. In addition, miniature paintings, medals, and craft jewelry are displayed in pneumatic drawers. Interpretation is provided in the form of 10 touch-screen computer kiosks located around the Luce Center, and a staffed information desk provides assistance for visitors seven days a week.

The audio information service will provide visitors with access to pre-recorded commentaries on objects on all three floors of the Luce Center. For the purposes of this pilot, 100 objects will be commented, probably representing one object in each case-side (there are 57 cases in the Luce Center, each with an a side and a b side).  Audio tour content for about 100 objects and overview messages for about 10 display case-sides will be provided by SAAM for the purposes of this pilot. In addition, SAAM will provide welcome and instructional audio messages as required to explain to visitors how to use the audio service. Each audio message will be available as a unique digital file in WAV or MP3 format. 

At a minimum, the contractor shall be required to provide the following services:

A.	Audio playback system
Audio information should be available to visitors on mobile devices that allow the visitor to listen to the information while looking at objects in the display cases. The mobile device may be the visitors own, and/or provided at the Luce Centers information desk. If the proposed device is a cellphone, the vendors content management and playback solution should be able to work with a principal telephone number specified by the Museum.

B.	Interface to audio content 
Visitors should be able to identify objects about which they wish to hear audio commentary by manually entering or selecting a unique identifier for each object through a keypad or other interface on the mobile audio playback device. For the purposes of this pilot, temporary markers can be inserted in the display cases to identify the objects that have audio content.

C.	Content management system
The audio information solution should allow the Museums staff to update content available to visitors regularly, at least weekly, for preference daily. These updates may include adding new content, changing existing content, or removing audio files from the system. The content management system should support both pre-recorded content, and content recorded ad hoc as required.

D.	Usage reporting
The Museum requires a usage reporting system, providing some or all of the following nformation:

1.	Which commentaries have been listened to, in which order, by visitor and by call 
                     or visit;
2.	Frequency with which messages are accessed overall, by all visitors;
3.	In the case of a cellphone tour, how many calls have been placed by each  
                     visitor, and their duration;
4.	Visitors place of origin (residence or origin of their phone number in the case of 
                     a cellphone tour); 
5.	Whether visitors listen to the entire message or stop before the end;
6.	Whether visitors use the messaging services (see below);
7.	Dates and times of peak and low usages, as well as average usage by day, 
                     week, month, and throughout the overall period of the pilot.

This is a best value procurement.  All firms responding to this solicitation will be required to submit a business and technical proposal for purposes of evaluation.  Proposals will be evaluated using the following weighted factors, as described in greater detail in the forthcoming Solicitation: 1) Technical Capabilities; 2) Past Experience; 3) Past Performance; and 4) Contract Price.   All evaluation factors other than contract price, when combined, will be granted more weight than contract price.  

The Solicitation documents will be available upon written request, on or about the week of May 15, 2008, from the Smithsonian Institution, Office of Contracting, P.O. Box 37012, CC 350, MRC 1200, Washington, DC 20013-7012, Attn: Jennifer L. Kroan.  Prospective Offerors must provide a written request for solicitation documents on company letterhead with complete mailing address, telephone and facsimile numbers, email address and name of the appropriate company representative.  Written requests for solicitation documents may be delivered to the attention of Jennifer L. Kroan to the above address; sent by facsimile transmission to 202-633-7308; or sent by email to: kroanj@si.edu.  Prospective Offerors are encouraged to submit their written requests as early as possible, and preferably no later than May 9, 2008.  The due date for submission of proposals will be provided in the solicitation documents. 

The Smithsonian Institution expressly reserves the right in its sole discretion to not proceed with the solicitation or any subsequent negotiations or contract.  This pre-solicitation notice shall not commit the Smithsonian to pay any preparation costs nor to provide reimbursements for any costs associated with a response to the same.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This is a negotiated procurement and is open to all business concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238330 with a small business size standard of $13.0 million.  The Solicitation will be available on or about May 15, 2008.  Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.  Once you have registered with CCR, you will be required to register with FEDBIZOpps.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.  Mail, facsimile, telephonic, or electronic mail request will not be honored.

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau intends to conduct market research with companies/ organizations to gather pricing information for programming a Computer Assisted Personalized Interview (CAPI) Blaise instrument for the National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation (FHWAR) used in three waves of data collection.     

The following Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a Request for Quotations (RFQ) by the U.S. Census Bureau.  The Bureau is not accepting offers at this time nor will the information provided be evaluated or considered as an offer.  This Market Research information does not commit the Bureau to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Census Bureau is not responsible for any administrative cost incurred by a contractor in response to this request.  

All information provided will be kept confidential and will be utilized for market research purposes directly related to the Statement of Work provided below.  

National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation Scope of Services for Researching Vendor Cost

Purpose:

To research the cost for outside contractors to program a Computer Assisted Personalized Interview (CAPI) Blaise instrument for the National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation (FHWAR) used in three waves of data collection.  The CASES code from the last survey is provided as an attachment to this announcement to help prepare a cost estimate.

Background:

The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1956 and the Federal Aid in Sport, Fish, and Wildlife Restoration Acts authorize data collection for this survey.  The U.S. Census Bureau performs the work under Title 13, United States Code, Section 8 and works closely with the sponsor, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) of the Department of Interior.  The FWS has sponsored surveys of fishing and hunting at 5-year intervals since 1955.  The Census Bureau has conducted all of the surveys with the exception of the 1975 survey.

The purpose of this survey is to provide current data on fishing, hunting, and wildlife-related activities of a nonconsumptive nature, such as feeding, observing, and photographing wildlife.  Federal and state agencies use the data to help manage the countrys fish and wildlife resources.

Instrument:

The FHWAR Blaise instrument consists of several sections of questions within one instrument that are asked during three survey waves over the course of one year. The three waves and instrument sections are detailed below in the attached table.

Wave 1

The first wave consists of a screener interview conducted at the household level April through May.  The screener questions determine if anyone in the household has fished, hunted, or observed wildlife during the reference period, or determines the likelihood that any household member will engage in these activities at some time during the rest of the year.  

If a household member aged 16+ has engaged in the above-mentioned activities during the reference period, then that person screens into the middle instrument containing a detailed section of questions that is conducted right after the screener interview.  The detailed section of the interview consists of Sportsperson questions and Wildlife-Associated Recreation questions.  It is possible that a sample person will screen into both sets of questions depending on how the screener questions were answered.

Wave 2

If the screener interview determines that a household member will likely engage in fishing, hunting, or observing wildlife at any time throughout the rest of the year, then this sample person will screen into Wave 2 which will take place in September through October.  Wave 2 does not contain screener questions, only the middle detailed questions.  It contains the same detailed interview questions as mentioned in Wave 1.  Like Wave 1, it is possible that a sample member will receive both sets of questions (Sportsperson/Wildlife-Associated Recreation). 
  
Wave 3

Wave 3 conducted in January  February consists of two detailed sets of questions (Sportsperson/Wildlife-Associated Recreation) similar to those questions asked in the detailed middle section of Waves 1 and 2 but it also includes additional questions.  All sample persons eligible to be interviewed in Wave 1 and/or Wave 2 are selected to be interviewed in Wave 3.

Please see the attached document for a table which summarizes the instrument and its waves.



Pricing Estimate:

The Demographic Surveys Division of the U.S. Census Bureau requests pricing estimates for the following activities:

1.	Programming the FHWAR instrument in CAPI Blaise as described above.
2.	Working with the Census Bureau to ensure that the working instrument meshes   with Census Bureau control systems.
3.	Working with the Census Bureau to develop, test and revise the working instrument, systems test instrument, verifications test instrument, and training instrument.
4.	Delivering a systems test, verifications test, training, and production instrument.
5.	Supporting the field staff during interviewing period.

Please submit pricing spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel and any narrative in MS Word to denise.p.pepe@census.gov by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 16, 2008.

<DESC>Section 1: Introduction

The Budget Formulation and Execution Line of Business (BFELoB) is chartered under the Budget Officers Advisory Council (BOAC) and managed by the Department of Education.  This is an interagency effort to improve the quality of budgeting in the Federal Departments and Agencies.  The BFELoB has initiated a number of activities to improve collaboration between members of the Federal budgeting community, improve the skills of budget professionals, document common business processes, improve the flow of budget data between Federal entities, and identify and improve the automated budgeting tools available to the Federal Departments and Agencies.

The BFELoB has created a working group consisting of knowledgeable staff from a number of Federal Departments and Agencies to develop a comparison of off the shelf budgeting software tools both in use by Federal Departments and Agencies and available in the private sector. 

This comparison is not part of any procurement activity.  It is intended solely to help Departments and Agencies judge their own needs and make plans for fulfilling those needs.  The comparison would be available only to the Federal budgeting community.  

The off the shelf software tools of interest to the BFELoB are those that provide widespread support to the complicated processes involved in Federal budget formulation and execution, to include activities such as strategic planning, payroll modeling, budget performance and integration, budget document production, and reporting.  The BFELoB is not including in its review software developed for a specific Department application (that could not be used in another Agency setting) or of general budgeting use that does not meet the specific needs of Federal budgeting organizations (spreadsheet applications, for example). 

The BFELoB had earlier surveyed Federal Departments and Agencies and is aware of what is in place within those organizations.  As described below, the work group is participating in demonstrations of those systems as part of this review.  The final data gathering step in our process is to gain an understanding of systems meeting our criteria that are available in the private sector, so that those systems can also be included in our review.

Section 2: Approach

The BFELoB work group, which consists of acting professional Federal budget and IT officers, was established last year.  Steps taken to date and planned in the near future are as follows:

2.1	Develop Generalized Functional Requirements 

To focus the review process, both on the part of the reviewers and organizations with budgeting tools being reviewed, the work group developed a generalized set of functional requirements containing elements needed by most Federal budgeting organizations.  This set of requirements was initially based on the functional requirements used by several Federal Agencies in earlier procurement activities.  This generalized set of functional requirements is available at:

https://max.omb.gov/maxportal/webData/lob/datahost/Revised_Decision_Matrix_Requirements_v2.0.xls

2.2	Develop Budgeting Scenarios

To guide people demonstrating the budgeting tools and to help the work group review the products, the work group has developed a set of scenarios depicting common business processes that are part of the Federal budget formulation and execution process.  These scenarios are being used by the working group during the demonstrations described below.  The functionality called for in the scenarios will for the basis of the comparisons. The scenarios are available at:

https://max.omb.gov/maxportal/webData/lob/datahost/Formulation_and_Execution_Scenarios_v._2.doc

2.3	View Demonstrations

The work group has begun viewing demonstrations of budgeting software in use in Federal Departments and Agencies.  During these demonstrations, work group members are determining whether the particular information system meets the functional needs contained in the scenarios. 

The next step for the work group is to view demonstrations of vendor products not yet in use in a Federal Department or Agency.  As stated above, the work group is interested in reviewing software products that meet the specific needs of Federal budgeting organizations, not just generalized budgeting tools.

2.4	Create Comparison Document

When the work group has witnessed all of the demonstrations, it will produce a matrix document listing each software product, and whether it addresses the required functionalities in each of the scenarios.  It is assumed that no software product will contain all of the functionalities contained in the scenarios. 

The comparison document will be made available to Federal budget officials for review.

Section 3: Requested Action

Vendors that have budgeting tools designed to meet some or all of the needs of Federal budgeting operations as spelled out in the functional requirements document and the related scenarios, but not yet in use in a Federal Department or Agency, are encouraged to volunteer to demonstrate their software to the working group. Vendors are also welcome to optionally indicate which of the specific functional requirements in the Decision Matrix Requirements their product addresses.  They may do so by sending an email within two weeks of the date of this RFI to: Budgetlob@ed.gov .  The email should describe the software proposed for demonstration including (but not limited to) such elements as:
	A broad description of the functionality included in the product,
	A brief description of the technical aspects of the product (platform, underlying software, scalability, etc.), and
	A description of the products availability.
The email should also include the vendors contact information including name, phone number and email address.  The working group will contact vendors from whom we would like to receive a demonstration.

To reiterate, this comparison is not part of any procurement activity.  It is intended solely to assist Federal Government Departments and Agencies in assessing their current budget process capabilities and making plans to fulfill their needs.  Further, the inclusion of certain vendors in the comparison document should not be construed as an official endorsement by the U.S. Department of Education of any products or services offered.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
FUTURE CONTRACTS
CIO-SPNEW
1. Background
	
The federal government is committed to changing its business processes to achieve a world class standard of excellence.  This is being accomplished by adopting best business practices and the latest technology to create a more efficient, citizen-centered federal government. 
	
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been designated as an executive agent for purposes of providing Information Technology (IT) to the government.  Under this authority, NIH established three Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) to support the full range of IT needs across the federal government, with a particular emphasis on agencies like NIH and its parent, HHS that are involved in health care and clinical and biological research. 
	
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to open a dialogue with industry and potential federal government customer agencies as NIH formulates its sourcing strategy and request for proposals for the next generation contract (or contracts) to support government IT efforts, with a focus on health and research IT.  This next general contract (or contracts) will be a successor to the current Chief Information Officer  Solutions and Partners 2 Innovations (CIO-SP2i) and the Image World 2 New Dimensions (IW2nd) GWACs, which will be expiring in December 2010.  The third GWAC, the Electronic Commodities Store (ECS) III contract, is not expiring until 2012 and will continue to stay in effect.

The governments goal in this effort is to award the new contract (or contracts) to replace the CIO-SP2i contract and the IW2nd contract as far in advance as practical to facilitate effective contract transition.  Although there is no guarantee of future work under the successor contract (except for the minimum guarantee normally included in Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts), approximately $2.95billion has been ordered through these two GWACs over the life of the contracts from all sources.  Approximately 56% of that total was for HHS customers, including NIH.    

2. Scope

Using the current contracts as a baseline, the government may award one or more Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) in several functional areas.  Contractors will be given an opportunity to qualify in one or more of these areas.  Services are contracted for as needed via competitive task orders with the resultant GWAC holders. The government is also interested in ways to maximize opportunities for small and disadvantaged business concerns.  

The government currently envisions ten functional areas in the new contract (or contracts).   Over the ten year lifetime of the anticipated contract, technology will evolve, and as such, the government is looking to industry for innovative solutions in helping to develop a scope of work that meets current and future needs of the NIH, HHS, and the government-wide IT community, with a focus on health care IT, aligned with the Federal Enterprise Architecture.  The ten task areas described as follows are intended to be applied broadly to technology services and incorporate these technology advances. 

Specific details of task assignments, deliverables, documentation, training, applicable government/department/industry standards, etc., will be provided within individual task orders.  Individual task orders may include components from one or more task areas. 

Task Area 1  Chief Information Officer (CIO) Support.  The objective of this task area is to provide support to CIOs in implementing relevant laws, regulations, and policies, such as Paperwork Reduction Act, the Computer Security Act, Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) #63, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), and the Clinger-Cohen Act. Typical tasks may include services such as Total Cost of Ownership Studies, market research, agency enterprise architecture and information technology (IT) architecture support, A-76 studies, workforce management studies, IT Investment Board Process support, and SEI/CMMI analyses and implementation support.

Task Area 2  Outsourcing.  The objective of this task is to provide the IT infrastructure and IT services required to assume management and operations of government IT resources and IT business functions. 

Task Area 3  IT Operations and Maintenance.  The purpose of this task area is to support the operation and maintenance of IT systems in a manner that is kept viable with current vendor releases or government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) applications software upgrades. Operations and maintenance on IT systems normally covers all software and hardware associated with mainframe CPU's, PC-client/server, network-backbone-front end processors and all networks.

Task Area 4  Integration Services.  The purpose of this task area is to provide all activities necessary to develop and deploy an information system.  These efforts can include the integration of technical components, organizational components and documentation.  Systems integration may make use of program management, technical laboratories, prototypes, pilot systems, and tools and methodologies germane to business analysis and business process reengineering.  Especially in the healthcare and research domain, medical imaging systems, electronic health records, patient management systems, clinical management systems, and laboratory management systems are often provided via integration of commercial components with existing infrastructure. 

Task Area 5  Critical Infrastructure Protection and Information Assurance.  The purpose of this task area is to obtain the services that provide for the protection of critical infrastructure and assurance of agency information in ways that ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability, restoration, authentication, non-repudiation, protection, detection, monitoring, and event react capabilities. This task area may include security certification and accreditation, disaster recovery, emergency preparedness, information assurance, information systems security, facility protection planning, risk management, critical infrastructure asset identification, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) support, records management, electronic messaging, and intelligent data collection and analysis.

Task Area 6  Digital Government.  The purpose of this task area is to provide government services through digital, electronic means.

3.  Approach 

This RFI focuses on the technology and best business practices that would be required to implement a new contract (or contracts) to replace the current CIO-SP2i and IW2nd GWACs.  Vendors and potential government customers are requested to follow the format of the Directed Topics for Responses, Section 5.

NITAAC will evaluate and analyze all responses to this RFI.  The information received may be: 
 used in developing a business case for the project
 considered in the preparation of a subsequent Request for Proposal 

4. Responses
Prospective vendors and government agencies are invited to resond to the RFI by sending email to RFI-NITAAC@mail.nih.gov no later than 9AM EST, May 15, 2008.   Responses should include the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with us.  

Responses from vendors should be in Microsoft Office product format (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.) and, where possible, include the following:

1. A brief description of the firm including the corporate Web site, the firms business size, and NAICs code (see http://www.sba.gov/size/indextableofsize.html

2. A declaration of any potential conflicts of interest the firm may have in performing the work.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 9.504, the Government is seeking to identify and evaluate potential organizational conflicts of interest as early in the acquisition process as possible. The Government will evaluate such information and will, if deemed necessary, impose an appropriate mitigation strategy, which could include restricting the competition on a case by case basis.  

3. A statement of qualifications for the firm including a brief description of the firms quality control processes for deliverables. 

4. A summary of the extent of involvement of small and disadvantaged company sub-contractors in past contracts.

5. A response to the sections and paragraphs according to the paragraph numbers listed in section 5, Directed Topics for Responses.  NIH would appreciate respondents referencing the paragraph numbers in Section 5 for each part of their response.  Respondents are invited to answer some or all of the sections. The government appreciates focused responses for each topic. Respondents to this RFI may be requested to provide additional information or details based on their initial submittals. 

This RFI is for planning purposes only and there is no intention to acquire any products or services, or award any contract, based on this RFI. Information contained in this RFI is the result of experience with the current GWACs and is therefore potentially subject to modification and is in no way binding on the government. An appropriate RFP process may follow in the June 2008 timeframe, contingent upon final approval for the project.  

The government does not intend to pay for the information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the government will arise because of submission of responses to this RFI and the governments use of such information.  

The government prefers that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI.  However, responses to this RFI that indicate that the information therein is proprietary, or represents confidential business information, will be received and held in confidence. Proprietary information submitted, as part of responses to the RFI, should be clearly identified as COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE and it will be treated in-confidence. 

Prospective vendors and government agencies may also submit questions regarding the project.  Questions should be addressed to the same email address: RFI-NITAAC@mail.nih.gov.  Answers to questions received on or before May 7, 2008 will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS.  The government may consider questions received after that date, but there is no obligation for the government to post any further answers.

5. Directed Topics for Responses 

The government requests vendors respond to the RFI in the order specified in the sections below.  

5.1Sourcing

5.1.1 Currently, NIH is obtaining these services under two separate GWACs, the CIO-SP2i and IW2nd. Considering how imaging is being integrated throughout other IT systems, NIH is planning on combining these two contracts into one.  Please describe any advantages or disadvantages and whether imaging should be a separate functional area in the contract or integrated with the other functional areas.
5.1.2 What strategies should be employed in the RFP to assist in a Best Value award determination?  What best practices have been employed in other similar types of contracts?
5.1.3 To maximize opportunities for small (SB) and small disadvantaged business (SDB), NIH is considering the possibility of having a separate bidding category for task orders that are set aside for SB and SDB.  Do you think this is a necessary feature to improve opportunities for small businesses? Are there other ways NIH can improve opportunities for SDBs?
5.1.4 How should NIH best incorporate small business into the sourcing strategy that will provide maximum opportunities for the various small business categories, such as woman-owned, service disabled veteran owned, small disadvantaged, HubZone, etc.?
5.1.5 Should incentives be built in for small disadvantaged business, and if so, what should these be?
5.1.6 What strategies should be employed to take a successful performance based approach?  
5.1.7 What off-shoring issues should be considered to ensure that national interests and sensitive information is protected, quality and reliability is high, and that the IT solutions are aligned with NIH and federal government practices and standards?
5.1.8 CIO-SP2i included an explicit task area for ERP. Is this task area still important to identify as a separate focus area?
5.1.9 In the interest of attracting capable contractors who specialize in areas of interest to NIH, contractors may be qualified on a subset of the 10 task areas. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of partial qualification? Should this strategy be applied to all contractors or just SDBs as it was on CIO-SP2i?
5.1.10 Should there be any limitations on administrative fees that are remitted to NIH to reimburse NIH for the cost of administering the contract and task orders?
5.1.11 Considering that a 10-year contract is being envisioned, and considering the quickly changing technology anticipated during that period, what provisions, if any, should be made to allow additional contractors to participate during the course of the contract?  Are you familiar with any other procurement where this was done successfully?
5.1.12 What provisions should be included, if any, to allow contractors to qualify for additional functional areas during the course of the contract?
5.1.13 Should the contract include restrictions on the use of subcontractors, e.g., having vendors list their subcontractors in the contract and restricting subcontractors to work with only one prime contractor at a time?

5.2  IT Policy Compliance
5.2.1 Support to the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) will be maintained through a mapping of contract functional areas to the FEA, rather than a direct citation of the FEA elements as the scope. The assumption is that this will provide a more familiar and understandable depiction of the scope and make it easier for vendors to qualify for individual task areas. Is this assumption valid?

5.3 Scope

5.3.1 Are there other functions, capabilities, and features beyond those currently contained in the CIO-SP2i and IW2nd GWACs that should be added to the new contract scope either because they are related services or that they represent directions that industry or potential government customers predict will become more germane to this domain area in the future?

5.4 Architecture 

5.4.1 Are there issues to be considered when mapping to the Federal Enterprise Architecture?

5.5 Security
5.5.1 Are there recommendations to consider regarding architectural and technical information on the security provisions that would be suitable for this contract (s). 
5.5.2 What risks exist and what mitigation steps can be taken? 
5.5.3 How is privacy information secured and protected in your data base?
5.5.4 How and where is authentication done?
5.5.5 How is the information secured during transmission?
5.5.6 What challenges, if any, are there for your company to comply with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) requirements?
5.5.7 What challenges, if any, are there for your company to comply with and utilize standards and guidelines promulgated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in its entity-wide information security program? 
5.5.8 What challenges, if any, are there for your company to comply with the applicable standards, implementation specifications, and requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) security rule, found at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SecurityStandard/Downloads/securityfinalrule.pdf covering electronically protected health information?  

5.6 Best Business Practices
5.6.1 Are there best business practices you could recommend that are pertinent to this project?
5.6.2 Are there best business practices you could recommend that are specific to the IT industry?
5.6.3 Are there best business practices you could recommend that would better automate task order processing?  
5.6.4 Are there any other suggestions or ideas for NIH to consider in this requirement?

<RESPDATE>122004
<CONTACT>Darrick A Early, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-260-0293, Email darrick.early@hhs.gov
<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The Federal Response Plan of the Department of Homeland Security designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response to man-made or natural disasters. In 2002, HHS established the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP). This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies threatening the civilian population. The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for response to a public health emergency. *** DESCRIPTION *** This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. The Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), also referred to as radiation sickness, is an acute illness caused by irradiation of the entire or a significant portion of the body by a high dose of penetrating radiation in a relatively short time period (minutes).  This exposure results in the depletion of hematopoetic stem cells and progenitors, resulting in severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  Severe neutropenia can significantly increase an individuals susceptibility to lethal infections, while thrombocytopenia increases the risk of hemorrhage.  Currently there are no approved therapeutics to mitigate ARS.   The Government has an interest in identifying sources of therapeutics likely to be effective in preventing or reducing the development of neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia when administered at times after acute exposure to radiation.  The Government is particularly interested in identifying therapeutics that are effective when given several hours to days after exposure.    Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DHHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy to meet the Nations bioterrorism defense needs. Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit a capability statement to the DHHS. Submitted information should include: a) a description of the product including relevant chemical, physical chemical or immunological characteristics; b) a description of the mechanism of action of the product; c) a description of the proposed formulation, dosage and route of administration; d) a statement of the proposed indications for use; e) a statement of the proposed production process and the current state of validation or GMP compliance; f) an estimate of production capacity and timelines, and estimated cost; g) a product development plan for GMP production, animal and human studies; and h) the overall stage of product development including the current status of preclinical and clinical safety and efficacy studies. All information submitted to DHHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. Information must be submitted by December 20, 2004. Responses should be limited to 25 pages and are preferred in electronic format and can be e-mailed to the attention of the technical contact person: Marissa A. Miller, DVM, MPH, ORDC, Phone 202/690-6013, email Marissa.Miller@hhs.gov. Please ensure that at least TWO (2) COPIES of all responses are submitted: one to the technical contact person, Marissa A. Miller, and one to the primary contracting point of contact, D. Andre Early.
Under provisions laid out in the Project BioShield Act of 2004, future competition may be limited to sources responding to this request for information (Sec. 319F-2(c)(7)(C)(vii) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 274d-6b).

It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. DHHS/OPHEP/ORDC has a requirement for the acquisition and maintenance of novel therapeutic products for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to treat U.S. civilians exposed to weapons of mass destruction, including nerve agents.  Nerve agents include organophosphorous insecticides, soman, sarin, tabun, VX and Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs).  HU-BCHE has been demonstrated to be effective as a prophylactic against nerve agent induced mortality and morbidity.  HU-BChE is isolated and purified from the Cohn Fraction IV-4 of human plasma. The Government has an interest in identifying sources of GMP HU-BChE and developing capabilities for the licensure of an appropriately formulated preparation of HU-BChE for either intravenous or intramuscular injection.  While proof-of-principle animal studies have been completed, additional animal challenge studies are likely needed to support the eventual licensure of the product.  In responding to this RFI, indicate the proposed process for extraction and purification; potential formulations for intramuscular injection; and production capacity annually (estimate).
The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources of HU-BChE, manufactured under a commercial scale GMP process, tested for efficacy in animal models of nerve agent exposure and for safety in human volunteers.  Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DHHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy to meet the Nations bioterrorism defense needs. Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit a capability statement to the DHHS. All information submitted to DHHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. 

Information must be submitted by January 14, 2005. Responses should be limited to 25 pages and are preferred in electronic format and can be e-mailed to the attention of Darrick A.

<DESC>The current Chicago Metropolitan Area Acquisition (MAA) Contract with AT&T Corp., (GS00T99AHD0001) expires at midnight on May 19, 2008.  This notice is to advise that the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, for continued performance for a 7-month period beginning May 20, 2008, and ending December 19, 2008, with AT&T Corp.  The contract fulfills the need for successful transition to the new CALSC Contract (GS05T07BMD009) with an estimated dollar value of $547,000.00.  This contract is authorized under FAR 6-302-1, only one responsible source, and no other services will satisfy the agency requirements.  The incumbent contractor is in place, operational and able to provide the services during this interim period with full system implementation without interruption and degradation.  The current contracts expire May 20, 2008 and the agency cannot perform its mission during this interim period nor can it tolerate the disruption to its customer agencies.  The interim period encompasses the time needed to finalize the current transition from the Chicago MAA Contract to the new CALSC Contract (GS05T07BMD009).  The contract is necessary to allow sufficient time to implement transition from the existing Chicago MAA Contract.  This is not a formal solicitation.  The government does not require individual acknowledgement by potential respondents.

If so, is this a comprehensive contract where all hours and shifts of the facility must be covered by the contractors, or is this a service contract where the hours and shifts are partially filled by contractors as they are available?  If you operate as a business or a coporate propriety and is registered in Central Contract Registration (CCR) as such under NAICS code 621111, then you can respond to the RFP.  The Government has insufficient coverage provided by GS (General Service)employees and military personnel.  Contractors fill in the gaps on the schedule.  Therefore this is a service contract.<BR>3.  Your SF 1449 indicates this is a set aside for SDVO small business. The Army Single Face view says the set aside is small disadvantage business.  Can you confirm that this is a SDVO set aside?  This is a set aside for a Service Disabled Vet Owned Small business.  The RFP in the ASFI has that indication on the first page as well as clause 52.212-5.<BR>4.  Bidders List.  Bidder's list is not available<BR>5.  Person (incumbent) or entity currently performing the contract/project.  Top Docs Inc.<BR>6.  Main differences between old statement of work and current one or the old contract number, title, award date of when this project was last performed/managed.  Old PWS under para 1.2.5.2.4 (Professional Qualifications)- All physicians who have completed a residency in Emergency Medicine are considered qualified in ACLS/ATLS/PALS and do not require those certificates.  ATLS certification is also encouraged.  POP for W91YTZ-07-P-0495 was 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008.<BR>7.  Old contract amount and or price.  W91YTZ-07-P-0495 $2,205,705.60.<BR>8.  Other questions and answers from other contractors/persons.  Will be posted in  Fedbizopps on 30 April 2008.<BR>9.  Can we send in our quotation either by Email or fax?  Please send proposals by email as noted in 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors Addendum.<BR>10. Has the quantity of hours changed since the previous award?  Yes<BR>11. Have there been any other questions from interested bidders?  Yes Are you going to post the questions/answers online? Yes<BR>12.  In section 1.5 the Government states that, The quality control plan shall incorporate current quality assurance programs in place at the MTF, in their own QC, to ensure that the medical services are provided at a level of quality that meets MTF standards.  I did not see the Government's QAP in the solicitation.  In order to incoporate the Government's plan into our own, could you please direct me to where it is located in the solicitation, or, if it isn't in the solicitation, to add it.  Also, I did not see whether our QCP is due with the proposal or at some later date.  The Government's QAP will not be incorporated into the solicitation and the Offeror's QAP is not due with proposal.<BR>13.  Could you please explain why this acquisition changed from a personal service contract to non-personal services?  The changed was based on lack of Governmental supervisory coverage of contract employees after 12:00 a.m.  <BR>14.  What is the current volume and level of acuity?  36,000/year, 10 admissions a day, level 3 trauma center care, and 100 pt /day.<BR>15.  What is the current staffing matrix to include physicians, PA/NP, RN's etc? New contract needs residence trained and board certified only<BR>16.  What will be the hours of the shifts for the contracted physicians?  Normally 1P-11P, 3P-1A, and 9P-7A (overnight).<BR>17.  What percentage of nights will the contracted physicians perform?  100%<BR>18.  What percentage of holidays will the contracted physicians perform?  90%.<BR>19.  How many hours/shifts per month will the contracted physicians perform?  64-80 shifts a month.<BR>20.  Will physicians be allowed to work more than 40 hours, not to exceed 48 hours per week?  That will be left to contractor discretion.  The ED schedule is made to offer empty shifts for the contractor to fill, but we will not require one doc to be scheduled for more than 40 hours.  The contractor may schedule them any way they desire as long as they do not exceed 80 hours per pay period (1 pay period = 2 weeks) <BR>21.  Will Board Certified EM physicians be acceptable without a residency in Emergency Medicine as long as their boards are current (grandfathered)?  Would the Government consider 50% of the hours covered by an FP/IM with recent ER experience?  Only residency trained in Emergency Medicine is acceptable.  Board certification is expected, but may be waived to allow the employment of new residency graduates from Emergency Medicine programs who have not yet completed the boards but are eligible to complete them within 3 years of graduation.<BR>22.  If the physician is Board Certified in Emergency Medicine, is this still required, as they are trained in trauma?  No ATLS is not required due to residency training in EM.<BR>23.  Amendment 2, review 1.2.4.2 and 1.2.4.3 states the schedule of shifts needed will be provided the 25th day of the month, approximately 6 weeks prior to the month to be worked.  Does this mean that the contractor must have the completed schedule to the COR prior to the 15th day of each month.  Yes.<BR>24.  Amendment 3 changed the licensing requirements from a 50 state license/DEA to VA state license/DEA.  Will the Government reconsider a 50 state license?  This will NOT be reconsidered. <BR>25.  What is the anticipated patient load for the emergency room per year?  Of the total number how many patients will each physician expect to provide health care?  36,000 patients a year.  Each doc should be moving at least 2.2 patients per hour of level 3 care.<BR><BR>

Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show

(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; 
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; 
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;

(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and 
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. 
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers.

(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. 
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and 
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or 
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governments control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. 
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. 
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

ITEM PURCHASE DESCRIPTIONS

NSN:  6230-00-500-0523 (dtd 04/05/07)

LANTERN, ELECTRIC: Electric hand lantern, dry cell operated, single concentrated light beam. Shall be in accordance with the following characteristics:

Design.  The lantern shall be a complete unit including battery case, light bulb, switch, handle, and reflector assembly. A positive means shall be provided for holding the ANSI/NEDA 908 6-volt lantern battery in the battery case.

Switch.  The switch shall have an ON and OFF position. The switch shall be capable of electrical operation after 25,000 cycles at a rate of 15 &#61617; 1 cycles per minute from OFF to ON and back to OFF. The switch shall be of a push-button design, wherein the switch is clicked between ON and OFF positions. Slide switches shall not be permitted.

Impact resistance.  The lantern, stabilized at a temperature of 0 &#61617; 2&#61616;F (-17.8 &#61617; 1.1&#61616;C), shall be able to withstand an impact of 1 ft-lb (1.36 J) using a 1 lb (0.454 kg) steel ball without sustaining any damage. The impact is applied to the base (side opposite the handle), the end opposite the reflector and the lens ring side.

Durability drop.  The lantern (battery included), stabilized at a temperature of 75 &#61617; 2&#61616;F (23.9 &#61617; 1.1&#61616;C), shall be able to withstand the following testing without sustaining any damage: lantern is dropped from a minimum height of 3 feet (0.915 m) into a box of loose dry sand with a minimum depth of 1 ft (0.305 m). The lantern is dropped three times on the base and three times on the end opposite the reflector.

Concentrated beam.  The concentrated beam shall have a maximum diameter of 10 inches (0.254 m) at a distance of 60 inches (1.52 m) from the lantern lens.

Beam candlepower.  The minimum beam candlepower (candelas) of the concentrated beam shall be 5,000 at 5.2 volts under the following conditions:

The test distance is 10 feet (3.05 m) between the lantern and the photoreceptor. The photoreceptor is calibrated using the standard lamp with a color temperature of 2856 K. The photoreceptor has a minimum diameter of 1 inch and is equipped with light filter to yield a response curve matching that of the International Commission of Illumination Standard observer. The calculation is as follows:

I = E x D2, where I = Luminous intensity of the light beam in candelas.
E = Illuminance reading of photometer calculated in foot-candles.
D = Distance between the lantern lens and photometer.

Measurement system.  The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded as the standard. The metric values stated in parentheses are for informational purposes only. Testing equipment may be specified in metric units without mention of equivalent inch-pound units.

Metric products.  Products manufactured to metric dimensions will be considered on an equal basis with those manufactured using inch-pound units, providing they fall within the tolerances specified and all other requirements of this document are met. If a product is manufactured to metric dimensions and those dimensions exceed the tolerances specified in the inch-pound units, a request should be made to the contracting officer to determine if the product is acceptable.

Workmanship.  The lantern shall be free from any defects, imperfections, or material that would adversely affect performance, serviceability, or appearance, or cause any undesirable effects during use.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>The 247th EN DET mission is changed from 7-21 June to 01-21 June 08.  Ensure quotes submitted are for the three week period of performance, versus the two weeks, previously annotated on the original combined synopsis/soliciation.  Request the drill rig be in place, in Yuma, not later than Friday 30 May 08.  The unit will inspect and mobilize all equipment to the site starting Sunday 01 Jun 08.  Response date for replies extended - See above. Questions and replies as of 30 April 08 are as follows:<BR><BR>QUESTION #1<BR>1a. My question concerns generally how the program operates? We generally operate our rigs with 3, 3 person crews with one toolpusher, operating 24 hours per day. <BR><BR>The 247th Engineer Detachment from Connecticut will be responsible for conducting the mission west of Yuma, Arizona on the Barry M. Goldwater Range. The unit commander in combination with the US Border Patrol will recommend the duty day hours based on the mission evaluation. <BR> <BR>1b. It appears you just want the one driller.<BR><BR>Traditionally, the drill rig provider includes 1 operator as part of the bid.  We will look to the operator for specific guidance on usage of their rig, although the National Guard will be the predominant operators.  In the past, the operator has been part of the team and supports the overall mission as needed.<BR><BR>QUESTION #2<BR>2a. It appears that your agency will provide people to operate the rig under the supervision of an Arizona Licensed driller? <BR><BR>Correct.  The AZ License Well Drill inspector will be provided via contract with the US Army Corps of Engineers.  The inspector will decide when they visit the site based on mission progression.<BR><BR>2b.I would be curious:<BR>   2b1.how much experience the laborers have in operating drilling equipment, <BR><BR>The 247th EN DET is a very experienced well drilling unit.  Well drilling is what this unit does in the Army.  This unit conducted a successful mission last year in AZ.<BR><BR>   2b2.Who would be responsible for insurance if one of your laborers were hurt operating our equipment, and so on.<BR><BR>All members of the 247th EN DET are on military active duty during their time in AZ as part of this mission.  Personnel matters will be taken care of through military channels.<BR><BR>QUESTION #3<BR>3a.If the laborers are inexperienced and return the equipment in worse condition that it was in initially, are there damages able to be recovered? <BR><BR>The AZ National Guard has a well defined and executed process for inspecting military and commercial equipment throughout the mission.  The equipment will be thoroughly inspected upon arrival and at the end of the mission.  All items will be noted using the US Army documentation process, including sworn statements and associated justification materials.  Damages to heavy equipment used on the border mission are forwarded to the AZ National Guard contracts office for review and final decisions on action to be taken.<BR><BR>3b.Is the driller responsible for teaching the laborers,as well as maintaining the equipment? <BR><BR>We will request specific guidance on any items the vendor wishes to provide regarding the specific piece of equipment being provided.  Because the location of the mission is remote and predominately sand, we recommend that the drill rig provider include all fluids, greases and such to ensure the rig is not damaged by the harsh operating environment.  The National Guard will provide fuel to rig during the mission.<BR><BR>QUESTION #4<BR>4. Any (additional) information would be valuable in evaluating the project.<BR><BR>None<BR><BR><BR>QUESTION #5 <BR>Do we provide diesel fuel for the operation?<BR><BR>No, the Arizona National Guard will provide the diesel fuel for the drill rig during the fueling process for all heavy equipment on-site.<BR><BR><BR>QUESTION #6<BR>Do we supply the materials for construction?<BR><BR>No, the Bill of Materials for construction of the well will be provided by the US Army Corps of Engineers.<BR><BR>Potential contractors are to submit all questions in writing.  Forward questions to the USPFO - AZ Contracting Office at emily.guchereau@us.army.mil.<BR>

Requests for sample certificates can be made to Lynnae Roscoe at 202-395-7670 or by email to lroscoe@oa.eop.gov.  Please make your request by Thursday, May 1, 2008 and include name, address, and phone number.

(b) What is the flow of the orders?  Will the orders be arriving in batches?  If so, approximately how many per batch, and with what deadlines?  ANSWER: Yes, the orders will be given on a bi-weekly basis and the completed certificates should be delivered to us on a weekly basis with final completion within 5 months from date of award.  The number of certificates completed weekly will depend upon the calligraphers proposed work output (min-max per week) over the next 5 months.  As a general guideline, to complete 900 certificates over a 20 week period, that would be an average of 45 certificates per week or 9 per work day. 

(c) Will the lettering be done exclusively in black ink? Can you send a sample of a completed award so that I can see what you are looking to emulate?  ANSWER:  Yes, all lettering shall be in black ink. The lettering style for the hand calligraphy should match the pre-printed calligraphy on the certificates as best as possible.  However, the size of the hand calligraphy will be slightly larger than the print on the certificate.  We cannot provide a completed sample, but see response to (a) above where a pre-printed certificate with calligraphy will be provided.  We will provide a sample of the type of information required on the certificate.

2.  The following is amended: 

(a) Quantity of certificates is approximately 900;
(b) Vendor will be responsible for costs of pickup and delivery of Certificates from and to Government site at 17th and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC  20503.
(c) Date to request sample certificates is Thursday, May 1, 2008.  Requests may be sent to Lynnae Roscoe at lroscoe@oa.eop.gov or by phone to 202-395-7670; 
(d) Date for receipt of quotes is extended to 2 pm, Friday, May 9, 2008. Quotes must be delivered via Federal Express or UPS to the Office of Administration, Procurement and Contract Management Office, c/o GSD/RDS, Anacostia Naval Annex, 250 Murray Lane, SW, Bldg. 410, Door 123, Washington, DC 20509, Attn: Lynnae Roscoe (no faxes will be accepted).

Questions concerning this solicitation may be addressed to Lynnae Roscoe at 202-395-7670 or to Moyra Cassidy at 202-395-7667.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to attach answers to questions and to attach an originally overlooked attachment titled, "Clinical Guidelines, 14 Feb 08".
1.     The SOW makes reference to RECYCLE RATE rate on page 2, Institutional Requirements , item 1. 2), then again in Appendix E, the SOW refers to ATTRITION RATE.  Are these terms being used interchangeably?  Under the current contract a RECYCLE is a student who fails a section of the course and is then recycled into the next available course.  Where as a WASHOUT is a student who has failed twice and is removed from the program.  Under the current contract and for CoAEMSP standards, it is only the WASHOUT student who is counted in the attrition rate, will this be the same in the new contract?

2.     Reference ATTRITION RATE, is this counting only students who failed due to academics, or does it included students removed from the program for any reason (disciplinary or personal issues, and academic)?

3.     In Appendix E, I am assume the 15% in item 4 is an error.

4.     In the actual Solicitation, page 12, towards the bottom, under INVOICING/PAYMENT.  None of the options apply, since billing has been done per class.  I understand this is a new contract, how does the USAF wish the invoicing to be done, per class, or annually or monthly as stated in the Solicitation?

5.     It is our assumption in constricting our pricing breakdown, there has been no changes what so ever in the POIs currently being used, and those POIs will the ones used in the new contract.  Am I correct?  If not, can you forward any POIs which have been changed, in particular the POIs pertaining to Labs and clinical. 


6.     Reference the SOW, page 4...
8) coordinate, set-up, and assume all fees associated with anatomy lab experiences for Kirtland AFB based classes with the exception of transportation which will be coordinated and supplied by the USAF.  

Will all classes, including those off site, required to have an anatomy lab?


1.  The terms RECYLCE RATE and ATTRITION RATE are interchangeable.  The definition is--when a student fails to meet academic requirements and is removed from the class.  This will be one of the Performance Objectives for the contract.  The term WASHOUT is a term that refers to a student who is completely removed from the program for either academic or administrative reasons.  The contractor will not be held responsible for administrative WASHOUTS or administrative RECYCLES.  

2.  Attrition rates for the purpose of measuring the Performance Objectives will only count students who are academic RECYCLES or WASHOUTS as opposed to students who are RECYCLES or WASHOUTS by the USAF for non-academic reasons.

3.  In Appendix E, the Performance Threshold, Item 4, for EMT-Paramedic does have a type error. This will be changed to read--Class attrition rates greater than 12% will result in contractor being fined 10% of annual invoices.

4.  Invoicing will be completed for each individual EMT-Basic and EMT-Paramedic class utilizing factors in Appendix A.  Invoicing will be completed utilizing the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) web enabled application.

5.  All Plans of Instruction for each training program have been updated to reflect vendor text updates and program structural changes.  The Statement of Work includes a copy of each courses Syllabus and schedule.  These documents indicate exactly how each block of instruction is to include hours dedicated to each lecture or skill lab and also indicate how many instructors are required. When reviewing the schedule for EMT-Basic please reference the box labeled MIR requirement and it identifies the instructor to student ratio.  When reviewing the schedule for EMT-Paramedic please reference the box labeled Instructors assigned and it also identifies the instructor to student ratio.  Most skill labs have a 4:1 instructor to student ratio.  NREMT skill testing and Clinical rotations have higher ratios.

<DESC><p>Regarding Section 52.212-3, k-2-iii, (page 35 of the solicitation document): The clause requires certification that a contract service employee "will spend only a small portion of his or her time servicing the government contract" which is in conflict with the requirement to hire a full-time manager, coordinator, and administrator. How should this be reconciled in the response to the solicitation regarding these positions as well as any other full-time positions needed to fulfill the scope of work?</p>
<p><br />2 answers: 1st is that at the end of page 34 of 52.212-3, k....it reads that the Contracting Officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph k(1) or k(2) applies. Since neither of those are checked you don't have to complete those areas. The 2nd answer is that since these services are professional in nature, you are exempt from the Service Contract Act of 1964 and wage determination anyways IAW Far Part 22.11. Note: FAR 52.212-3 and everything on pages 26 thru 39 of the solicitation are just questionnaires titled Representations &amp; Certifications and are not Contract Terms or Conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>This purpose of this modification is to add an additional topic area as follows.  No other changes have been made.

The purpose of this modification is to seek white papers for applying Information Technology to improve Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance Division (ISRD) intelligence (INTEL) functions by application of advanced algorithms and software tools for:  automated aggregation of multiple foundational INTEL sources (OSINT, HUMINT, SIGINT, IMINT) and data fusion of INTEL data for the space domain. White Papers are being sought that provide automated indications and warning (I&W) and predictive modeling of adversarial counterspace threats to US space assets (both on-orbit and terrestrial); and automated all-source space INTEL analyst decision support capabilities to help INTEL analysts provide timely and highly accurate space threat assessments. The objective of this modification is to overcome current limited Space Situation Awareness capabilities to detect, identify, anticipate, and assess adversarial counterspace threats to US space assets by rapidly developing software tools and automated techniques to provide timely, accurate, relevant, aggregate, anticipatory threat assessments and confidence levels; this novel capability will enable INTEL analysts to easily and rapidly understand adversarial counterspace intentions and actions in time for effective defensive counterspace actions to be achieved.

The recommended date for white papers for this topic area is by 30 May 2008.  DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.  All white papers must be addressed to ATTN:  Randall McIntyre, Reference BAA 05-06-IFKA, AFRL/IFSA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505.  Respondents are required to provide their Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number with their submittal and reference BAA 05-06-IFKA.  Electronic submissions to:  Randall.McIntyre@rl.af.mil will also be accepted.  

CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION:  Offerors are required to submit 3 copies of a 2 to 3 page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A:  Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B:  Task Objective; and Section C:  Technical Summary.  Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b).  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC.  

No other changes have been made.

<DESC><p><br />The Defense Support Program Office intends to issue a follow-on contract to the current DSP Post Production Services Contracts (PPSCs) to provide factory and operations site(s) support and sustainment to the on-orbit DSP satellite constellation. The DSP mission uses highly technical non-imaging infrared and other sensors to detect ballistic missile launches, space launches, endoatmospheric and exoatmospheric nuclear detonations, and reports them to US and allied forces and assets deployed worldwide through the Integrated Tactical Warning and Assessment (ITWAA) configuration control processes. The follow on contract will provide the following support: (1) Technical support to operational missile warning on-orbit constellation satellites, trending analysis, performance and data archive, as well as the training of new personnel; (2) Spaced based non-imaging infrared mission performance assessment for real-time mission support and infrared event data analysis; (3) Operational satellite and payload anomaly support to include root cause determination and implementation of corrective actions; (4) Contractor facility supporting on-orbit operations; (5) Program support including management of contractor team and contract/business operations segment to track financial issues and deliverables; (6) Capability to develop software tools and implement command plans; and (7) Support at various government sites. In addition, the government will continue efforts currently on the PPSCs as follows: (1) rapid prototyping of data processing enhancements that maximize the utility of DSP data and maintain mission capability of aging assets; and (2) mission processor initiatives.</p>
<p>The sole source RFP for the new contract, called the DSP On-Orbit Support and Sustainment Contract (DOSSC), will be released in May 2008 with contract award in September 2008 (see Numbered Note 22). The contract type will be cost-plus-award-fee and cost-plus-fixed-fee. The period of performance will be for one base year and four one year options (FY09 - FY13). The intended contractor is Northrop Grumman Space Technology, One Space Park, Redondo Beach, CA 90278. The DSP Program Office has contracted with NGST over the last 30 years for these services and the contractor possesses all of the required data necessary to provide sustainment and support of the DSP constellation described above. NGST has the capability to fulfill this contract without the DSP Program Office having to expend significant funds on another contractor to reach the equivalent capability. Contractors interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact NGST directly. The NAICS code is 541712 (size standard: 1,000 employees).</p>

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
(1) Contract financing payment and invoice payment have the meanings given in section 32.001 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
(2) Electronic form means any automated system that transmits information electronically from the initiating system to all affected systems.

(3) Payment request means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts: Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input. Information regarding WAWF is available on the Internet at https://wawf.eb.mil/.
(c) The Contractor may submit a payment request and receiving report using other than WAWF only when--

(2) DoD is unable to receive a payment request or provide acceptance in electronic form;
(3) The Contracting Officer administering the contract for payment has determined, in writing, that electronic submission would be unduly burdensome to the Contractor. In such cases, the Contractor shall include a copy of the Contracting Officer's determination with each request for payment; or
(4) DoD makes payment for commercial transportation services provided under a Government rate tender or a contract for transportation services using a DoD-approved electronic third party payment system or other exempted vendor payment/invoicing system (e.g., PowerTrack, Transportation Financial Management System, and Cargo and Billing System).
(d) The Contractor shall submit any non-electronic payment requests using the method or methods specified in Section G of the contract.
(e) In addition to the requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall meet the requirements of the appropriate payment clauses in this contract when submitting payments requests.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to remove the consideration of existing institutions for this solicitation.  See the following description:

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has a requirement for the management and operation of a correctional facility to house a population of approximately 4,000 low security, adult male inmates, that are primarily criminal aliens.   This requirement will be fulfilled through awards resulting from this solicitation and RFP-PCC-0012.  Either solicitation may result in awards up to 3000 beds; however, the combined resulting awards from both solicitations will not exceed an estimated award of 4000 beds.  The inmates shall be housed in a secure correctional institution or institutions located anywhere in the continental United States.  The BOP will fulfill this requirement through multiple awards and anticipates that each facility or complex of facilities will house a minimum of 900 beds to a maximum of 2,500 beds. 

Proposed institutions shall meet BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. Offerors are prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates at the institution(s). 

The proposed facility(ies) must be a newly constructed institution or an existing institution with expansion to accommodate approximately 900-2,500 beds on a daily basis. 

The contractor must be ready to receive Notice to Proceed (NTP) based on the following:

1.  Existing facilities with expansion, existing beds, 120 calendar days after contract award.

2.  Existing facilities with expansion, additional beds, 300 calendar days after contract award.

3.  New construction, 425 calendar days after contract award. 

NTP may occur earlier at the request of the contractor but only if the BOP determines the contractor is capable of accepting inmates.    

The BOP intends to award a firm fixed-price type contract with award-fee incentives.  The contract awards will have a potential term of 10 years, consisting of one four-year base period and three two-year option periods.  Contract performance will be governed by a performance-based statement of work based on American Correctional Association/Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions.  

Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government. The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued.  Information will be required from offerors regarding both existing and anticipated environmental impacts and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is located.  Environmental documentation and other related information will be required with the submission of your proposal in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).  A NEPA analysis will be performed for each proposed contract action.  An Environmental Impact Statement may be required prior to contract award.    

This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to both large and small businesses.  Faith Based and Community Organizations can submit offers equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the BOP.  

The solicitation will be available on or after 4/29/2008, with an anticipated closing date for receipt of proposals on 6/30/2008.  The solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administrations Federal Business Opportunity website http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  All contractors doing business with the federal government shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  The website for CCR is www.ccr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System code for this solicitation is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  Interested parties requiring further information should email Amanda Pennel, Contracting Officer, at apennel@bop.gov or Cathy Scott, Senior Contract Specialist, at cstewart1@bop.gov.

The main gate at the NTS is approximately 65 north of Las Vegas, Nevada. The work location for this project is approximately 10 miles north of the NTS main gate within the boundaries of the NTS. This renovation consists of Roadbed Modification (NDOT, Section 305) and applying a new three-inch thick asphalt overlay. Mercury Highway is a 26-foot wide road. The renovated road will include two twelve-foot wide travel lanes and two one-foot wide paved shoulders.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Request for Information (RFI) ORDC-05-01 for Therapeutics to Treat Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Associated with the Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-ORDC-05-01
<RESPDATE>122004

<CONTACT>Darrick A Early, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-260-0293, Email darrick.early@hhs.gov
<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The Federal Response Plan of the Department of Homeland Security designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response to man-made or natural disasters. In 2002, HHS established the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP). This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies threatening the civilian population. The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for response to a public health emergency. *** DESCRIPTION *** This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. The Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), also referred to as radiation sickness, is an acute illness caused by irradiation of the entire or a significant portion of the body by a high dose of penetrating radiation in a relatively short time period (minutes).  This exposure results in the depletion of hematopoetic stem cells and progenitors, resulting in severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  Severe neutropenia can significantly increase an individuals susceptibility to lethal infections, while thrombocytopenia increases the risk of hemorrhage.  Currently there are no approved therapeutics to mitigate ARS.   The Government has an interest in identifying sources of therapeutics likely to be effective in preventing or reducing the development of neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia when administered at times after acute exposure to radiation.  The Government is particularly interested in identifying therapeutics that are effective when given several hours to days after exposure.    Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DHHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy to meet the Nations bioterrorism defense needs. Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit a capability statement to the DHHS. Submitted information should include: a) a description of the product including relevant chemical, physical chemical or immunological characteristics; b) a description of the mechanism of action of the product; c) a description of the proposed formulation, dosage and route of administration; d) a statement of the proposed indications for use; e) a statement of the proposed production process and the current state of validation or GMP compliance; f) an estimate of production capacity and timelines, and estimated cost; g) a product development plan for GMP production, animal and human studies; and h) the overall stage of product development including the current status of preclinical and clinical safety and efficacy studies. All information submitted to DHHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. Information must be submitted by December 20, 2004. Responses should be limited to 25 pages and are preferred in electronic format and can be e-mailed to the attention of the technical contact person: Marissa A. Miller, DVM, MPH, ORDC, Phone 202/690-6013, email Marissa.Miller@hhs.gov. Please ensure that at least TWO (2) COPIES of all responses are submitted: one to the technical contact person, Marissa A. Miller, and one to the primary contracting point of contact, D. Andre Early.
Under provisions laid out in the Project BioShield Act of 2004, future competition may be limited to sources responding to this request for information (Sec. 319F-2(c)(7)(C)(vii) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 274d-6b).

It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. DHHS/OPHEP/ORDC has a requirement for the acquisition and maintenance of novel therapeutic products for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to treat U.S. civilians exposed to weapons of mass destruction, including nerve agents. Nerve agents include organophosphorous insecticides, soman, sarin, tabun, VX and Non-Traditional Agents (NTA's). HU-BCHE has been demonstrated to be effective as a prophylactic against nerve agent induced mortality and morbidity. HU-BChE is isolated and purified from the Cohn Fraction IV-4 of human plasma. The Government has an interest in identifying sources of GMP HU-BChE and developing capabilities for the licensure of an appropriately formulated preparation of HU-BChE for either intravenous or intramuscular injection.  While proof-of-principle animal studies have been completed, additional animal challenge studies are likely needed to support the eventual licensure of the product. In responding to this RFI, indicate the proposed process for extraction and purification; potential formulations for intramuscular injection; and production capacity annually (estimate).
The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources of HU-BChE, manufactured under a commercial scale GMP process, tested for efficacy in animal models of nerve agent exposure and for safety in human volunteers. Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DHHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy to meet the Nation's bioterrorism defense needs. Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit a capability statement to the DHHS. All information submitted to DHHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. 

Information must be submitted by January 14, 2005. Responses should be limited to 25 pages and are preferred in electronic format and can be e-mailed to the attention of Darrick A.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN AMENDED.  PLEASE REVIEW UPLOADED MODS 3 AND 4 FOR CURRENT DETAILS.  THE PROPOSAL DUE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO JUNE 5, 2008.  

The U.S. General Services Administration is seeking a qualified, small business contractor to provide Design-Build Services for development of a new 9,930 SF office building on the Bureau of Reclamation Campus in Yakima, Washington.
Design will be limited to Engineering Services (mechanical and structural), as the Architectural Design is being provided by GSA.  The estimated magnitude of construction is between $1.0 and $5.0 million.  Occupancy is currently planned for June 2009.

The NAICS category applicable to the predominant portion of the work is 236220 (Office Building Construction).  The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $31.0 million.  This procurement is set aside for small business participation only. 

This will be a negotiated procurement handled in accordance with FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures.  Technical proposals will be required to address Past Experience, Past Performance, Management/Technical Approach and Key Personnel Qualifications, and will be reviewed against evaluation factors outlined in the Request for Proposals (RFP).  Price proposals will be reviewed for reasonableness and their demonstration of understanding of project requirements.

For the purpose of determining award, the combined technical evaluation factors are considered roughly equal in importance to price and price-related factors.  Though this is a negotiated procurement, the Government reserves the right to propose award based on initial offers.  Award will be made to the offeror representing the Best Value to the Government.  The Best Value concept allows for award to other than the lowest priced or highest technically rated offer.  Such an award decision may be arrived at following a technical/price trade-off analysis by the evaluation board.

The RFP document for this solicitation GS-10P-08-LT-C-0040 is expected to be released by April 4, 2008.  The RFP will be uploaded directly to FedBizOpps to achieve the widest possible distribution and facilitate access.  No paper or electronic copies will be distributed by the Contracting Office.

The Technical Package, that includes the specifications, drawings and other technical requirements, is being distributed separately via CD set due to the sensitive but unclassified (SBU) nature of the contents.  Offerors interested in receiving a set must review, complete and submit the SBU Document Security Form attached to this announcement along with a copy of their business license to the attention of the Contracting Officer, Maria Williams, via hard copy at the following address: GSA, PBS, Property Development Division 10PCP, 400 15th Street SW, Auburn, WA  98006.  Or, the original, signed document and a copy of the firm?s business license may be scanned and submitted via email to maria.williams@gsa.gov.  Be sure to include the company name and address to which the CD set of specs and drawings should be sent, as well as the name, phone number and email address (mandatory) for the main point of contact.

If this request is your first expression of interest in this project, please indicate if you are interested in this project as a prime contractor, as a member of joint venture or partnership, or as a subcontractor.

Please return to this FBO announcement frequently during the procurement, as GSA plans to utilize FBO to post updates and amendments to the solicitation.

<DESC>PROJECT INFORMATION:  Design and Construct a new F-22A 7-Bay Aircraft Shelter.  The layout of the facility shall be 3 or 4 contiguous hangar bays separated by a support hub or core area. The core area will consist of a fire suppression room, electrical room, mechanical room, and mens and womens restrooms. Place of Performance:  Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.  The estimated design and construction cost for this project is between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000. CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This solicitation will be a design-build, full and open competitive procurement. The procurement will be conducted using source selection procedures and the award will be based on the best value to the Government considering price and non-price factors, cited in this announcement and the solicitation.  Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed priced. NAICS Code:  236220 with a size standard of $31,000,000.  Anticipated NTP:  30 September 2008 with a 540 calendar day period of performance.  Offerors are advised that a contract resulting from this solicitation is contingent upon Congressional approval.  Should Congress not authorize this project or appropriate the funds, the solicitation will be canceled.  If the project is canceled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror. If a large business is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirements for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  The FY07 subcontracting goals for this contract are a minimum of 70.0% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses, 6.2% of that to small disadvantaged businesses, 7.0% to woman-owned small businesses, 9.8% to HUB zone small businesses, 3.0% to Verteran-Owned small businesses, and 0.9% to service disabled veteran-owned small business.

All contractors are advised that they must be registered in CCR.  Joint ventures must also be registered in CCR as a joint venture.  We advise contractors begin this process when they prepare their proposal in order to ensure this registration is in place should they be selected for the award.
