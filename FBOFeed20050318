<CONTACT>Elisa Brown, 202-385-8397
<DESC>MARKET SURVEYâ€”REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) PROGRAM:  AIR TRAFFIC ORGANIZATION-TRAINING SUPPORT FOR AIR TRAFFIC (TSAT) BACKGROUND:    The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is planning to award a contract to provide managerial, supervisory, instructional, and administrative personnel required for continuous Air Traffic training and training related services in 54 facilities nationwide.  The training related services are needed to achieve and maintain the required number of Certified Professional Controllers (CPC's).  The FAA anticipates awarding a Performance Based Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, employing a fixed pricing arrangement per labor hour.  The contract will have one base year with 4 option years.  REQUEST:   The FAA is requesting industry's recommendations regarding what performance based factors should be used for this requirement.  To assist you with your response, the Statement of Work (SOW) of the current training contract is attached. The FAA does not anticipate major changes to the SOW when the competitive Screening Information Request (SIR) is released.  The FAA anticipates release of the SIR in the third quarter of the current government fiscal year.  The FAA will take industry recommendations under advisement.  Any industry input in response to this RFI would not be treated as proprietary information.  If any recommendations are accepted by the FAA, the TSAT requirement will not be issued or awarded on a single source basis. The FAA may not respond either in writing or verbally to any comment or suggestion/recommendation received.  The final SOW/solicitation may provide evidence of FAA consideration of the comments or recommendations received. The FAA is also considering restricting this requirement to be a Small Business Set-Aside.  In order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition amongst eligible small businesses or socially and economically disadvantaged business that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program (8(a) certified) or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement without restrictions.   In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested SB or 8(a) vendors: 1.  Capability Statement - This document should identify past performance references, dollar amount, type of effort conducted and your experience. 2.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) 3.  If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business, the percentage of work that must be completed by the prime is 51%.   4.  Completion of the attached Business Declaration form.  If applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date.  Additionally, in order to be eligible to compete, the SB or 8(a) Offeror must have as a minimum qualification requirement, the ability to cover payroll and other operating and administrative expenses to accommodate Government "in arrears" payments for work performed for a period up to sixty (60) days, ninety (90) days for large businesses.  For historical informational purposes, the monthly cost incurred could range from $2,000,000.00 to $2,500,000.00, which will cover the aforementioned expenses.  Small business or 8(a) will be able to invoice the FAA twice a month and large businesses once a month.   The Government reserves the right to include additional minimum qualification requirements in the resultant SIR. Interested parties should submit their responses to this RFI, not later than April 5, 2005, 2:00 pm eastern time, either electronically or via hard copy to the following address:  Federal Aviation Administration, Headquarters, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC  20591, Rm. 408, ATTN:  Ms Elisa Brown, Contracting Officer, ATO-A/ASU-340 or elisa.brown@faa.gov.

This announcement is a Request For Information (RFI), it is not a Screening Information Request  (SIR) or a Request For Quotes (RFQ).  This RFI does not represent a commitment by the FAA to issue a SIR or RFQ.   All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this RFI announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with RFI submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense.

Description:

Call for bids for the attribution of licenses to establish and operate 
public telecommunication networks in Morocco.  To open the Moroccan market 
to full competition, the licenses will offer:

1.  Regulatory commitments:
- Interconnection based on long-run incremental costs:  2006
- Pre-selection:  12 months after the award of the licenses
- Partial unbundling of local loop:  18 months after the award of the 
licenses
- Unbundling of local loop:  36 months after the award of the licenses.

2) A technologically-open approach:  Bidders can opt for any wireline or 
radio technology.
3) Until January 2003, no more than 3 players (including the incumbent 
fixed-line operator) per segment.  Segments are:
- Segment 1 or local loop, includes Batch (1a) and Batch (1b)
- Segment 2 includes National transmission
- Segment 3 includes International gateway.
4) Custom-made approach:  Interested candidates can apply only for the 
license they need:  (a) Local loop for fixed services (per area); (b) 
local mobility services (per area); (c) national transmission and (d) 
international gateway and transit. 

5.  Batches available for bids:

Batch 1a:  Local loop (wireline/wireless):  Winners will build and operate 
local loop (wireline/wireless) networks to offer fixed services.  One 
batch per area will be granted, in 3 available areas, with available 
frequencies of 3.5 GHz; 3.7 GHz, 10 GHz, 26 GHz and 28 GHz; and fixed 
numbering.

Batch 1b:  Local loop with limited mobility:  Winners will build and 
operate wireline/wireless local loop networks to offer fixed services and 
mobile services in pre-defined limited local areas, using the frequencies 
of 800MHz, 3.5 GHz, 10 GHz, 26 GHz and 28 GHz.  The areas of mobility will 
cover up to 35 km. One batch per area will be granted, in 3 available 
areas, with the right to access 3G mobility after 18 months of actual 
operation.

Batch 2:  National transmission (long distance backbone):  Winners will 
build and operate national transmission infrastructures (LD) to access 
end-users through specific numbering codes.  Two licenses are available 
under this batch and FH frequency will be granted on demand.

Batch 3:  International transit (International Gateway):  Winners will 
build and operate international infrastructure for incoming and outgoing 
international traffic.  Two licences will be granted.  In order to be 
awarded an international gateway license, interested candidates must bid 
on one of the local loop licenses (at least) and/or a long distance 
licenses.
 
Interested candidates can bid on one or several of these different 
batches, as described above.  However, bids for an international gateway 
license alone will not be considered.  Possibility for the winners of a 
local loop license to extend to a 3G license.

6.  Areas available for the licenses:  A map of available areas is posted 
on the regulator's website 
(http://www.anrt.net.ma/admin/download/upload/ng5.pdf), page 4.

7.  Key Rights:
- Bidders will be awarded a license for 30 years, renewable.
- Until January 2008, the number of operators will not exceed 3 operators 
per segment (including the existing terrestrial player).
- Right to freely decide on tariffs (in compliance with fair competition 
rules).
- Right to interconnect its networks with other Moroccan public operators.
- Right to access any infrastructure required to establish its own 
network, including alternative infrastructure owners.

8.  Key Obligations:
- Publicity of tariffs.
- Equal treatment of customers
- Provision of required information to the regulator ANRT.
- Contribution to the fund for education, research and standardization (1% 
of net revenues) and to universal service (2% of net revenues). 
- Commitment to deploy a quality network (as stated in the candidate's 
proposal).
 
9.  Main Principles for attributing the licenses:
- The evaluation process will favor large scope bidders requesting 
multiple batches.  Except for the International gateway batch, 
participants can apply for a single batch.
- Assessment is based on a combination of technical and economic criteria 
(references and commitments) and financial criteria (the proposed license 
fee). Technical and economic criteria will account for the larger part of 
the assessment.
- Technical and economic criteria are based on the commitments that 
participants are willing to make in terms of network deployment and 
quality of service.  Once the license is attributed, the commitments 
proposed by a candidate become legally binding.
- The incumbent cannot participate to the tender for these new licenses
- Existing GSM operators are not allowed to apply for the local mobility 
bath (1b)
- Shareholders of a consortium commit to maintain their participation in 
the consortium for at least three years
- At least one of the reference operator must have a significant 
experience in telecommunications.

10.  Withdrawal of the tender document

Telecommunications operators and other interested parties can withdraw the 
tender document against payment in advance of twenty thousand (20,000)

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation announcement.  This is NOT an invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Application (RFA) and in no way obligates the US Government to award a contract or cooperative agreement.  However, potential sources that may be interested in this competitive process are requested to mail, fax, or e-mail their interest to the contact address by March 25, 2005.  

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement a new agricultural project (Market Access and Poverty Alleviation, or MAPA II) that will support technology transfer, access to markets, institutional strengthening of farmer associations and agricultural sector policy development.

MAPA II will build on progress made under the current agricultural project, MAPA I, and expand assistance to the altiplano and the National Agricultural and Livestock Health and Food Safety Service (Servicio Nacional de Sanidad Agricola, Ganadero e Inocuidad Alimentaria, SENASAG) and other possible activities.

In the valleys region of Bolivia MAPA II will focus on the following areas:  strengthening and consolidating the Valleys Foundation (FDTA-Valleys), producer business organizations, agricultural-related enterprises and commodity chains in the valleys, improving the technology access process with strengthened implementing entities, providing technology that matches producer needs with market requirements, while carrying out environmentally-sound activities.

In the altiplano, MAPA II will promote improved technologies in production, harvest and post-harvest processes and intermediation in quinoa, onions, camelids and possibly other products.  The program will also work to strengthen producer organizations and business enterprises, develop a strategic approach for the quinoa chain, and improve the competitiveness of elements of at least two traditional commodity chains.

In the policy and regulatory areas, MAPA II will strengthen specific technical capacities within SENASAG to help it provide the plant and animal health protection and food safety services required to effectively support the development and growth of a competitive agricultural sector, with special emphasis on supporting other USAID activities.  The program will also improve other policy or regulatory areas, such as taxation and refund procedures, access to technology, and technical information systems within SENASAG.

It is anticipated that a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) type contract will be awarded for implementation of the activities outlined above.  Implementation will occur over a five-year period.  USAID/Bolivia encourages qualified offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  The Mission anticipates issuing the RFP o/a March 30, 2005.  Proposals will be due on approximately May 30, 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of integrated, surface-emitting panel architectures for millimeter wave (MMW) transceiver arrays.  The Scalable Millimeter-wave Architectures for Reconfigurable Transceivers (SMART) program will culminate in a required objective demonstration of a large (at least 400 element), coherent, active electronically steerable array (AESA) achieving a functional density (e.g., output power density expressed in W/cm3) vastly greater than achievable with current architectures (e.g., slats or bricks). A possible approach to realizing thin arrays of the desired type might make use of micro-fabrication and wafer-scale assembly techniques.  The three-dimensional (3D) multi-layer modules that are expected to result will greatly reduce AESA packaging complexity.  These, in turn, are expected to be used to form MMW arrays of arbitrary sizes that are composed of modular, batch-fabricated sub-array building blocks. New capabilities, such as the ability to construct reconfigurable and/or multi-band AESAs and other MMW circuits, will be enabled by this architectural approach.  Successful attainment of the SMART program’s objectives is anticipated to result in an enormous improvement in the size, weight, performance, and cost of future military systems that operate at MMW frequencies.

Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices and systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  
1.	Mechanical Integrity of a Multilayer Transceiver Array, including the demonstration of reliable and high-yield integration of a 3D stack of layers in a thermally stressing environment;
2.	Thermal Management of a Multilayer Transceiver Array, including the demonstration of thermal management solutions for a 3D integrated stack;
3.	Electrical Integrity of a Multilayer Transceiver Array, including the demonstration of horizontal and vertical interconnections with acceptable insertion loss, tolerance to device manufacturing variations, and circuit stability. 

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Technical Interest section of the BAA 05-27 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Awards are expected to be made during the second half of calendar year 2005.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are highly encouraged.  A web site http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.  The technical POC for this effort is Dr. Mark J. Rosker, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: mrosker@darpa.mil.

B. Full text of announcement
I.  Funding Opportunity Description 

DARPA seeks strong, responsive proposals from well-qualified sources for a new 
research and development program called GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) with the goal of eliminating the need for linguists and analysts and automatically providing relevant, distilled actionable information to military command and personnel in a timely fashion.  

The goal of the GALE program is to develop and apply computer software technologies to absorb, analyze and interpret huge volumes of speech and text in multiple languages. Automatic processing “engines” will convert and distill the data, delivering pertinent, consolidated information in easy-to-understand forms to military personnel and monolingual English-speaking analysts in response to direct or implicit requests.

GALE will consist of three major engines: Transcription, Translation and Distillation.  The output of each engine is English text. The input to the transcription engine is speech and to the translation engine, text. Engines will pass along pointers to relevant source language data that will be available to humans and downstream processes.  The distillation engine integrates information of interest to its user from multiple sources and documents.  The engine may gather all documents relevant to a specific query, identify various kinds of new information, produce structured information from unstructured text, discovering entities, relations, and events to populate knowledge bases or gather fragmented information, discarding repetition, and indicating contradictions and changes over time. Military personnel will interact with the distillation engine via interfaces that could include various forms of human-machine dialogue (not necessarily in natural language).

To facilitate engine interconnection and application implementation, one program task will be to develop a flexible Language Exploitation Environment (LEE). The LEE will include well-defined interfaces and control software for interconnecting the major processing modules (Transcription and Distillation or Translation and Distillation) and input data bases in GALE.  

As successful technologies emerge, proposers of insertion projects will include them in a series of carefully selected operational applications.  The goal is to get functional technologies into the hands of users quickly. Other programs and agencies may enhance and modify the emerging GALE technology to suit their needs and incorporate it into their operating environments.

Proposals are sought for efforts to provide  large quantities of data, organized and annotated in appropriate ways, needed for effective research, algorithm development and performance evaluation.

Proposals are also sought for methods to evaluate the operational utility (impact) of processing engines (alone or in combination with one another). 

Engines must be able to process naturally-occurring speech and text of all the following types: broadcast news, talk shows, newswire, newsgroups, weblogs and telephone conversations. The source languages will be English, Chinese and Arabic plus surprise languages to be announced later.

DARPA’s desired end result includes a transcription engine and a translation engine that produces English transcripts with 95% accuracy and a distillation engine able to fill knowledge bases with key facts and to deliver useful information as proficiently as humans can. 

The GALE program will not include predetermined phases. Each offeror is asked to propose its own set of Go/No-Gos on the path to achieving the program’s accuracy targets as  stated above, except for the first set of targets for the transcription project, set at 65%, and the translation project, set at 75%. This includes the length of time required by the offeror to get to each Go/No-Go as well as the accuracy level to be achieved at each Go/No-Go. Individual proposals will be evaluated on their scientific merit as well as on their Go/No-Go-based plan to achieve the desired program goals.  Achieving the proposed accuracy goals at the end of each of the offeror’s Go/No-Go phases is only a necessary condition for continuing.  Analysis showing that the technique has the growth potential to meet the ultimate goal is also required.  Even here, DARPA may still eliminate the lowest performing effort.

II. Award Information 
The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Final funding determination will be based on the combination of proposed approaches which will reasonably support program success. Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.


III. Eligibility Information
1.  Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for Small Disadvantaged Business, HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.
2.  Cost Sharing or Matching
Cost sharing is not required for this particular program; however, cost sharing will be carefully considered where there is an applicable statutory condition relating to the selected funding instrument (e.g., for any Technology Investment Agreement under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371). 

IV. Application and Submission Information

1.  Address to Request Application Package

This announcement and the PIP contain all information required to submit a proposal.  No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.  [Note: see paragraph 6, “other submission requirements,” for reference to the PIP.]

2.  Content and Form of Application Submission
This BAA requires completion of an online Cover Sheet for each Proposal prior to submission.  To do so, the offeror must go to http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=05-28  and follow the instructions there.  Each offeror is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Proposal.  If an offeror intends to submit more than one Proposal, a unique UserId and password must be used in creating each Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.
Security classification guidance on a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award.  If you choose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA.  

PROPOSAL FORMAT
Offerors must submit an original and 2 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk, or cd).  Mac-formatted disks will not be accepted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 05-28, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy number of 2.  
3.  Submission Dates and Times
The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON (ET) 2 May 2005, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 05-28, Global Autonomous Language Exploitation (GALE) will remain open until 12:00 NOON (ET) 16 March 2006. Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through 16 March 2006. While the proposals submitted after the 2 May 2005, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, offerors should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals.
4.  Intergovernmental Review – N/A
5.  Funding Restrictions
Authorization of precontract costs will be considered in situations of genuine urgency where programmatic benefits will accrue from their use.

B. Full text of announcement
I.  Funding Opportunity Description 

1.	INTRODUCTION
The DARPA Information Processing Technology Office (DARPA/IPTO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA to perform research and development to support the Transfer Learning (TL) Program.  

1.1	PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
The goal of the Transfer Learning Program solicited by this BAA is to develop, implement, demonstrate and evaluate theories, architectures, algorithms, methods, and techniques that enable computers to apply knowledge learned for a particular, original set of tasks to achieve superior performance on new, previously unseen tasks.  This goal reflects the observation that key cognitive abilities of humans include the abilities to generalize, abstract, reuse, reorganize and apply knowledge learned in previous life experiences to novel situations.  

1.2  PROGRAM SCOPE
This Program consists of three one-year phases, with decision points between each phase.  These decisions will be based on the amount of progress made against the project goals specified in the proposals.  This BAA is for all three phases.  DARPA anticipates awarding contracts for Phase 1 with two one-year options for Phases 2 and 3.

The Program solicits research contributions drawn from all applicable fields, particularly artificial intelligence and cognitive science.  It is anticipated that no single approach will provide the desired capability; rather, integrated approaches based on a synthesis of new and existing ideas from multiple research areas implemented as integrated systems based on a coherent theory or model are likely to be needed.

This Program and solicitation has two areas:  the primary area, which aims to develop integrated transfer learning capabilities, and the evaluation area, which will develop challenge problems and execute evaluations appropriate to measure to what degree the objectives have been achieved (or exceeded).  Offerors may bid on the primary area; all offerors must also bid on the evaluation area.

2.	TECHNICAL APPROACH
An ongoing integrated transfer learning capability will require combinations of diverse approaches drawn from traditionally distinct fields of research.  DARPA desires to achieve progress against the goal of an ongoing integrated transfer learning capability that is applicable to diverse tasks and domains.  The areas described in this BAA are designed to promote the formation of teams across disciplinary boundaries.

Key ideas that contribute to the ability to achieve the desired Transfer Learning will include modular knowledge representations, dynamically composable knowledge modules, and mapping between knowledge representations.  Recognizing the applicability of existing knowledge to novel problem solving situations will be as important as the ability to reuse the existing knowledge in the novel situation.  

Some approaches that may be of interest include learning by analogy, incremental or cumulative learning, chunking, learning by doing, and learning by taking advice.  This list is meant to be suggestive, rather than exhaustive; ideas not mentioned here are at least as desirable as those that are.  
Area A – Transfer Learning Technology Development
The objective of this research area is to develop ongoing integrated transfer learning capabilities.  Transfer learning is defined as the ability to use knowledge or skills learned  for an original set of tasks in an original domain to solve problems on a different set of tasks and/or in a different domain.  
Area B – Transfer Learning Evaluation Frameworks
In Area B, DARPA seeks a set of capabilities to demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of transfer learning.  These evaluation capabilities will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the technologies developed under area A.  It is anticipated that at least three distinct evaluation capabilities will be developed and used in this Program and that every technology developed under area A will be evaluated in at least three distinct domains.  This is to ensure that the technical approaches result in general transfer learning capabilities rather than domain-specific solutions.

II. Award Information 
The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Final funding determination will be based on the combination of proposed approaches which will reasonably support program success. Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors.

<ARCHDATE>03182006
<CONTACT>Susan Cowin Contracting Officer 8015394177     susan_cowin@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management, Utah State Office, Salt Lake City, Utah, has a requirement for noxious weed (Scotch Thistle, Whitetop, Knapweed & Broadleaf Pepperweed) control by ground application.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Number for this Request for Quotes is JSQ054047.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-20, dated February 23, 2004.  Contractor is to provide all equipment, supplies, personnel and supervision to complete this requirement.  Location of the treatment area is within the area of the St. George Field Office.  PLEASE CONTACT SUSAN COWIN AT (801)539-4177 FOR FAX (801)539-4222 OR DAVE CORRY AT (435)688-3256 FAX (435)688-3252 FOR MAPS OF THE TREATMENT AREAS. STATEMENT OF WORK:     GENERAL: The goal of this proposal is to 1) eventually eradicate Scotch Thistle from BLM administered lands within the St George Field Office area and 2) suppress or control hoary cress in the Black Ridge area.  Weed control will be accomplished by ground application of herbicides and/or hand cutting. Refer to the maps which show the general locations of this project.   DESCRIPTION OF WORK: 1)  Weed Treatment:  Application of herbicides in solution and/or hand cutting (scotch thistle) with (contractor-furnished) property.   SCOTCH THISTLE:  A description of the work setting for scotch thistle is as follows:  the areas to be treated range from scattered single plants, several plants at a location, concentrations of plants on approximately 1/10 acre and up to areas as large as 10 acres where plants are fairly consistent across the area (see attached maps). Thistle plants may be in all stages of growth, including seedlings, rosettes and maturing plants with flower stalks.  There are an estimated 4,300 acres of public land that needs to be searched for various densities of these weeds.  Actual acres requiring herbicide or hand cutting treatment will be much less than the 4,300 acres.    The lower elevation infestations will mature earliest and will then need to be treated first, beginning in early to mid- April.   Specific start date will be determined with the successful offeror at the Pre-work Meeting.  A time period is allowed to provide for weeds at varying elevations to be treated at the most appropriate times, with all areas being completed no later than May 31st, 2004.  The following is a general time frame based on past experience but actual dates may differ due to environmental factors which vary from year to year. Weed treatment will follow the following order and approximate begin dates: Little Creek Mtn area   	05/01	2,074 acres Black Ridge area         	05/10	2,017 acres Smith Mesa area         		05/10   185 acres HOARY CRESS (white top): The work setting for Hoary Cress will generally be patches of from a few plants to populations covering up to an acre.  These patches are scattered over a 1,718 acre area (see map) and the entire 1,718 acres will need to be searched.  Based on previous treatment of this area it is anticipated that the actual amount of area needing treatment (i.e. if all areas treated were consolidated into one patch) would be approximately 45 acres.  This may vary depending on precipitation and the effectiveness of the previous year's treatment.  For best control the herbicide will be applied during the bud to early bloom stage which is anticipated to occur in mid April.  Hoary Cress control will be completed by 4/30/04.  Due to its rhizomatous root system hand cutting of Hoary Cress is ineffectual and will not be allowed as a control method.  ALL WEEDS:  Actual begin dates will be coordinated between the contractor and COR. If weed infestations outside the mapped areas are located by the contractor or others, the COR will be informed and a decision made by the CO as to whether the area will be treated. Additional areas, approved prior to treatment, will be completed and paid for as described in section B, #2. Terrain and access for the Black Ridge area is difficult.  The surface is generally rocky given the volcanic nature of this area.  Also, juniper trees have recently been cut over much of the area and are laying on the ground adding to the difficulty of maneuvering through the area on ATV's.  As indicated, the entire project areas must be searched to find the scattered weed infestations.  To find the required 85% minimum of all Scotch Thistle and Hoary Cress requires an intense search defined for the purposes of this contract as: traversing the project areas in an organized manner starting at one end and progressing back and forth in a grid like manner until the entire area is completed.  Traverses will need to be about 50 ft apart but will depend on the stage of the weed plant growth (how visible it is) and the type of surrounding vegetation (ex. cheatgrass or sagebrush).  The Contract Officer Representative or Project Inspector on site will make recommendations to the contractor with the Contracting Officer having the final determination in case of disputes.  The power line, gas line and fiber optic right of ways (ROW's) in the Black Ridge Area are part of this contract and the contractor will expected to treat weeds on these ROWs.  2)  Weed Mapping:  Contractor is required to record the weed locations on a GPS (Geographical Positioning System) unit and also categorize the weed infestation as to species and size.  The recordation will be completed to the following specifications and submitted to the BLM upon completion of the contract and before final payment.  GPS units used must have an accuracy rating of at least 15 meters.  All GPS data should be submitted using the following format: Projection: 	Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Datum:		North American Datum of 1927 Zone:		12 Units:		Meters If Trimble GPS units are used, both .cor and .ssf files should be submitted as well as the corresponding ArcView shapefiles.  This format is preferred.  If consumer-grade GPS units are used, all GPS data should be submitted as a delimited text file in the following format: Projection: 	Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Datum:		North American Datum of 1927 Zone:		12 Units:		Meters The following shows the text file format and an example.  Note there are no spaces in the text file.  Submission of any other format may result in rejection of the data. Northing,Easting,Point_Name,Species,Size 4356221,342378,point_1,thistle,1/10acre LOCATION:  Work under this Contract is located on BLM lands in Washington County, Utah.  The work locations are shown on the attached maps.  ACCESS TO THE WORK:  Dirt roads and off-road travel by vehicle and/or foot travel.   CERTIFICATION: Contractor will show to BLM that all applicators are certified by the State of Utah as "commercial herbicide applicator". The contractor must verify that applicators are certified prior to contract award.  WORK LIMITS:  The Government will define, with maps, the outer perimeter of areas to be treated.  Perimeters adjacent to State or private lands will be identified on the maps and shown to the contractor in the field.  Due to the variable terrain, elevation and limited access an on site inspections by potential bidders, prior to bidding on the contract, are highly recommended.  Searches and weed control in the Black Ridge area will not be required in the mature tree portions of the Project Area.  The total acreage of mature tree areas is estimated to be approximately 350 acres.   Also, a recent tree thinning project completed in the Black Ridge area will make access somewhat more difficult.  A field trip (show me tour) is scheduled for March 29, 2005, 8:30am, meeting at 345 East Riverside Drive, St. George, Utah, allowing for those who so desire to be guided through the project areas.  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:  1. No less than 85 percent of all plants of the target species listed above on all sites within the identified perimeters must be treated with herbicide or hand cut. This includes plants in all growth stages from seedlings to maturing plants. The intent is for all plants to be killed prior to seed maturity.  For Scotch Thistle, plants controlled using herbicide must be treated before the flower starts opening.  Plants with open flowers must be hand cut.  A site is defined as anywhere at least one plant occurs. Meeting this requirement may be difficult on many areas without spending an adequate amount of time. Due to the habitat range and growth habits of Scotch thistle, it can be difficult to locate and remove. Monitoring for compliance will be completed by BLM. 2.  Beginning of weed treatment is dictated by the phenological progression of the plants.   Hoary cress treatment will be completed no later than 04/30/04 and scotch thistle no later than 05/31/04.  Delays due to weather conditions (stop work order) will be considered in extending the length of the contract. 3.  Contractor must return to the site and retreat any areas which are not in compliance with treatment specifications.  Failure to do so will result in the penalty described in section F(a). These treatment specifications as found in this contract are those described under C.1.6., C.3.O, C.3.1., C.3.2 4.  The contractor will provide a schedule of proposed treatment dates to the COR. This will be updated each week if changes are needed.  Contractor will report to the COR at least once weekly as to the progress of the project. This may be done through the project inspector. 5.  All herbicides will be applied in accordance with EPA labels and in compliance with all guidelines and restrictions. 6.   Contractor will complete an herbicide application form as required for BLM files. This form will be completed daily and all forms returned to BLM prior to final payment of the contract. The forms will by supplied by BLM. CONTRACTOR-FURNISHED ITEMS:  All personnel, materials, and equipment required to complete the project.  This includes herbicide, application equipment, vehicles, fuel, dye, water, and any other associated tools and equipment.  It is recommended that the contractor have available an ATV with pressurized spray equipment and hose attachments mounted on the vehicles.  ATV's and/or truck mounted spray rigs are recommended to assist in covering the areas.  Back pack pumps or shovels are also recommended to cover areas which are difficult to reach with trucks or ATV's. METHOD OF TREATMENT:  The weed plants can, generally, be treated by use of either herbicide or hand cutting or a combination of both. Scotch thistle plants with open flowers, as determined by the authorized officer, will be hand cut. HERBICIDE METHOD:  If treatment by herbicide is used, the following will apply. 1.  Herbicide and Dye: For Scotch Thistle, mix shall conform to the following: a tank mix of 32 oz 2,4-D, and 8oz Picloram per acre. For Hoary Cress, mix shall be: 1 oz. Escort (metsulfuron) per acre which should be premixed to ensure solution before adding to the tank.  Effective tank agitation is required to keep herbicide in solution.  Tank solution will include 25 gallons water with ph between 6.5 and 7.5.  All herbicides, surfactants, and dyes used must be on the BLM approved list (see attachment).  Surfactants and dyes will be used at recommended rates and in accordance with the product label.   Surfactants used with Escort must be nonionic.    2.  Spray Nozzles:  Spray rigs shall be equipped with nozzles capable of uniform distribution at the specified rate. 3.  Mixing Equipment:  Contractor shall furnish any equipment required for mixing treatment material.  The treatment material will be mixed according to the label.  It can be mixed on site as needed. Water sources will be arranged for by the contractor. 4.  Ground Crew:  Shall be furnished by the contractor. 5.  Weather Conditions: Application of treatment chemicals shall not be done when the wind exceeds 6 miles per hour.  Herbicide will not be applied when inclement weather conditions, (rain, hail, sleet, snow) is forecast within 6 hours following a planned treatment.  Also, herbicide will not be applied for at least 1 hour after receiving moisture from a weather storm. 6.  Rate of Application:  Scotch Thistle will be treated with 2,4-D at 32 oz/ac mixed with picloram at 8oz/ac  in a tank mix which includes approximately 25 gal water/ac (buffered if needed).  Hoary Cress will be treated with Escort at 1 oz tank mixed with 25 gallons of water per acre.  Non ionic surfactant and dye will be included at rates recommended on product labels. 7.  Areas of Application: See attached maps. 8.  Transportation of Herbicide:  The Contractor shall load and transport herbicide from the contractor's home base to the work site and between sites according to all applicable laws and regulations.  Upon completion of the work or termination of the contract, unused herbicide shall be returned by the contractor to the contractor's home base.  All used containers and other materials to be disposed of will be done according to the label. 9.  Growth Stage: Scotch Thistle plants will be found in all growth stages. This includes seedlings, rosettes, and maturing plants with flower stalks.  Hoary Cress should be found in the active vegetative growth to early bloom stage. HAND CUTTING METHOD: Hoary cress has a rhizomatous root system and as such is useless to hand cut at the surface.  Only herbicide treatment is acceptable for this species.  The scotch thistle plants can be cut at the ground surface but all vegetative plant material (all basal leaves) must be severed from the root.   It is not necessary to dig up the root.  Hand cutting should be completed with the least amount of soil disturbance possible.  If small weed plants and seedlings are uprooted while cutting, the plants will be separated from all soil material. If Scotch thistle plants are found which are in open flower, as determined by the authorized officer, they will not be treated with herbicide but will be cut down and all flower heads separated from the plant. These flower heads can be left on site. Suggested hand tools for cutting plants, are shovels and grubbing hoes. GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED PROPERTY:  None. INSPECTIONS The Contracting Officer or COR will make inspections as a basis for payments and recommendations for adjustments in work quality.  The contractor is encouraged to observe inspections while they are being made and have a supervisor on site to confer with the Contracting Officer or COR. ACCEPTANCE Work performed according to the specifications will be considered acceptable for payment purposes. MEASUREMENT FOR PAYMENT Final payment will be based on completion and acceptance of the job. When a minimum of 50% of the job is completed, a partial payment may be made upon request (by proper invoice) of the contractor and approval of the COR.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to solicit on an Other Than Full and Open Competition basis for the acquisition of Administrative and Clerical Support Services at the Training Air Wing Four (TW-4) located at Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi, TX.  The services will be accomplished through a modification extending the performance period under the existing Purchase Order N00140-01-M-0443.  The extension will consist of a 1-month period and 2, 1-month options. The extension is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Systeam, 1804 Highway 231 South, Laceys Spring, AL, 35752-3449), under the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a).  The purpose of this extension is to allow sufficient time to complete the procurement process for the competitive follow-on contract.     The applicable NAICS code is 561110 with a size standard of $6M. The Government intends to acquire the services from Systeam since they are the only source that currently has the personnel and the infrastructure in place to perform the requisite services by 1 May 2005 without the an additional 30-day phase-in period (starting 1 April 2005) that would be required from a different source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Government will not pay for information received.   Responses to this synopsis should be mailed to the attention of Mr. Joel Asher, Code 204.23 , FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Ave., Bldg. 2B, Phila., PA 19111-5083.       See numbered note 1.     The follow on requirement to Purchase Order N00140-01-M-0443 was synopsized on 23 April 2004 under RFQ number N00140-04-Q-0785. The RFQ was issued on 10 June 2004, closed on 14 July 2004 and is currently under evaluation.  For questions regarding this announcement, contact Mr. Joel Asher who can be reached at 215-697-9650 or e-mail joel.asher@navy.mil.

Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information.  Quotes that lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. For each contract provided as a reference, the Offeror should provide the following information: CONTRACT INFORMATION Contract Number:             							 Date Completed: Contract Type:                Fixed Price 		 Cost Reimbursement                        Other (Specify) Item Description and Quantity: Customer Name:                			Customer POC: (Person who can verify data) Address:                      Telephone:                              FAX: QUALITY NOTE:  An explanation must accompany all answers with an asterisk(*).

YES *      (Explanation)                          NO Did you receive any quality awards in the past three years?                         YES *     (List Awards)                         NO TIMELINESS Were all items delivered within the original contract schedule? YES       NO *       (Explanation) The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: (a) Neutral:  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance history or for whom past performance information is not available may receive a neutral rating for past performance. The evaluation of past performance will take in account past performance information regarding timely delivery and installation of quality product(s) conforming to the solicitation/contract requirements. The Government reserves the right to review past performance information and if deficient in demonstrating an "acceptable" risk, rate the past performance either as "neutral" or "unacceptable."  The Offeror must provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  An Offeror failing to provide the past performance information or to assert that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance may be considered ineligible for award. (b) Acceptable:  The Offeror’s performance of previously awarded contracts met contractual requirements.  The Offeror’s past performance record leads to an expectation of adequate performance, with little risk anticipated with delivery and installation of a quality product, on time, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the Offeror's past performance. (c) Unacceptable:  The Offeror’s performance of previously awarded contracts did not meet most contractual requirements.  Offeror’s past performance record leads to a strong expectation that successful performance will not be achieved.  Significant potential risk is anticipated with delivery and installation of a quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the Offeror's past performance. (3) Price (a) Price will be evaluated for reasonableness.  Performance risk assessments may be conducted as appropriate in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d)(3).  The Government will evaluate quotes on the basis of the total lot price.     Note: In evaluating those quotes determined under Factor (1) to be technically acceptable, Factor (2), Past Performance, is approximately equal to Factor (3), Price.  However, the degree of importance of price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals with regard to Past Performance.  Each initial quote should contain the Offeror’s best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.  The government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the above factors. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Dr. Mary Ann C. Stephens, 2807 Quail Creek Court, Ellicott City, Maryland 21042, to continue to provide services on the development of behavioral therapies for addictive disorders and other conditions comorbid with chronic drug use.  This program was created to support the therapy development.  The program consists of three (3) stages, in Stage I, scientists developed new innovative behavioral treatments, or modify and refine existing treatments.  Stage II is concerned with efficacy testing once preliminary evidence shows that a new approach holds promise.  Stage III research the necessary activities before treatments can be transported to the community, such as determining effective methods for training community therapists.  We need to continue developing approaches and modifying existing treatments to meet the needs of contemporary drug abusers, special populations, and the social environment.  Dr. Stephens has been participating in this activity for the past four (4) years, her continued role, activities, background and expertise will ensure successful completion of the tasks.  She has gained an in-depth knowledge of the NIDA’s Therapies Development Program.    In order to maintain continuity of the work that has already been performed, award of a contract to any other source would result in duplication of effort and substantial expense to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Background: The Behavioral and Integrative Treatment Branch supports the study of comprehensive research on the development of behavioral therapies for addictive diseases and other conditions of multiple mental disorders such as major depressive and personality disorders  which occur in an individual at the same time.  The Statement of Work is as follows: 1) The contractor shall identify, Review, Organize and Summarize Research Findings on Efficacious Behavioral Treatments for Addiction.  The Behavioral Treatment Development Branch has been engaged in establishing a database that synthesizes the literature on empirical studies of behavioral treatments.  The database is dynamic, and must be continuously updated as new findings emerge related to behavioral treatments for drug use disorders.  The contractor shall take the lead in areas related to the previous activities, on behavioral treatments and pharmaco-therapies.  The contractor shall be engaged in work related to expanding on how these treatments can be combined most effectively, and on assisting the Branch in coordinating the activities, updating the database, conducting literature searches and summarizing empirical support for various behavioral therapies for addiction.  2) The contractor shall prepare and review concept papers and summary documents in areas of interest to the Behavioral and Integrative Treatment Branch, provide language in several different areas of science in the behavioral treatment research field, review  draft documents prepared by other researchers in the Branch, and if appropriate, provide language to the NIDA program contact person for ensuring and strengthening the documents.  This is an ongoing activity that is essential in maximizing the promotion of areas of this research.  3) The contractor shall be responsible for the preparation of Powerpoint Slides for presentations at scientific meetings, meeting summaries, attending meetings and workshops planned by the branch, review literature related to drug abuse treatment and other materials regarding the growth and priorities of the Behavioral and Integrative Treatment Branch, take notes and create summaries of the meetings, prepare a variety of abstracts and bullets that are necessary to satisfy various NIDA reporting requirements.  The period of performance is for twelve (12) months beginning on the award date of the contract.  A sole source award to Dr. Stephens is contemplated for this requirement based upon the fact that NIDA needs to continue the research project on the development of behavioral therapies for addictive disorders and other conditions with chronic drug use, initiated by  Dr. Stephens.  Since Dr. Stephens has been engaged in this type of activity, it is to the government’s best interest not to change the contractor at this time so the integrity of the research will not be jeopardized.  It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements, is not applicable to simplified acquisitions. This requirement is under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541710, and Size Standard is 500.  This is a total small business set-aside requirement. Interested parties are requested to review the enclosed Statement of Work, and submit a proposal which shall include a loaded hourly rate, Curriculum Vitae, at least three (3) references documenting similar past performance experience, and a technical approach of how the work will be performed.  The proposals will be evaluated on the Offeror’s documented expertise and experience in (1) The treatment of substance abuse disorders; (2) research design and analysis of data representing complex systems; and (3) successful past performance experience on similar projects.  Proposals are due on April 2, 2005 by 4:30 P.M.   The proposal must also include any prompt payment discount terms, the Dun & Bradstreet number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the Offeror’s business size.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) requires a Large-Scale Genotyping Center to expand the utilization of NHLBI's well-phenotyped observational cohorts and intervention studies for genetic association studies, through the application of large-scale genotyping and widespread data dissemination for genotype-phenotype correlation. The NHLBI is planning to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to solicit proposals for a Large-Scale Genotyping Center to perform high-throughput genotyping for candidate gene association studies on up to 50,000 participants in HLBS studies; and a genome-wide association study on roughly 500 disease cases and 1,000 controls.  Studies with appropriate informed consent will be selected for participation by NHLBI prior to contract award based on programmatic balance across heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS) phenotypes; quality and breadth of phenotypic and environmental information; diversity of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographic origin of participants; representativeness and generalizability of cohort to US population; and quality and quantity of DNA available for genotyping.  The candidate gene association studies will involve in-depth characterization of more than 1700 candidate genes (8-10 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms SNPs per gene region) on approximately 50,000 study members in heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) studies, for a total of more than 850 million genotypes (at a maximum cost, including labor, of $0.01 per genotype at initiation; costs are expected to decrease as technologies evolve). The genome-wide association study will be implemented in the second year of this program based on the evaluation of the analytic approaches and strategies produced by current genome-wide association studies such as studies funded through the Design and Analysis for Genome-wide Association Studies RFA.  It will involve the use of a standard set of up to 300,000 state-of-the-art genetic variants in roughly 500 cases and 1,000 controls, for a total of roughly 450 million genotypes (at a maximum cost, including labor, of $0.01 per genotype at initiation; costs are expected to decrease as technologies evolve).  The Genotyping Center must have the capacity to generate at least 850 million genotypes over two years with an error rate of no more than 1%. The NHLBI Large-Scale Genotyping Center will also develop informatic management processes for curation and cross-study data comparison, and provide a computing platform that facilitates data portability, accessibility, and security. The Genotyping Center must keep abreast of the evolving National Electronics Clinical Trials and Research (NECTAR) network as envisioned in the NIH Roadmap http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/clinicalresearch/overview-networks.asp, as well as the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG), http://cabig.nci.nih.gov/ and the e-health record of the HHS National Health Information Infrastructure http://aspe.hhs.gov/sp/nhii/ as the computing platform and data set developed for dissemination must be capable of integration and interoperability with these platforms.  The Genotyping Center will also establish comparable, resource-wide standardized phenotypes, controlled vocabularies including metathesaurus, thesaurus, and defined data elements mapped across participating population studies, and prepare uniform protocol models facilitating post-collection coordination and the evaluation of comparability across data sources.  The Genotyping Center will integrate phenotypic and genotypic information pooled across studies, develop informatic management processes for curation and cross-study data comparison, and provide a computing platform that facilitates data portability, accessibility, and security.   The Genotyping Center will process requests for use of the data generated including: receiving requests, ensuring up-to-date IRB approval and completion of data distribution agreements from requesting investigators, creating data sets, distributing data sets to investigators, and providing technical support (answering questions about data).  The Center will also develop and implement plans for distribution of non-identifying summary data, such as allele frequencies, in public databases such as dbSNP.  In addition, the successful offeror will facilitate, attend, and/or participate in Steering Committee and Oversight Committee calls and meetings, as required by the NHLBI.  

NHLBI expects to award one contract. The period of performance is anticipated to be for 4 years beginning on or about April 01, 2006. The RFP NHLBI-HC-06-03 will be available on or about April 4, 2005, and can be accessed from the website address: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm and FedBizOps at www.eps.gov/index.html.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has a requirement to develop, conduct and evaluate a course of intensive training in clinical trial methodology for neurology research.   The field of neurology clinical trials is still fairly young; unlike in oncology and other disciplines, there is no highly developed standard for clinical trial methodology, especially with respect to pilot or early phase trials. Good design and conduct of clinical trials can provide the necessary knowledge for the generation of definitive answers about the effectiveness of new therapeutic approaches.  In contrast, poorly designed or administered trials may provide misleading results, subject patients to unnecessary risk, waste considerable resources, and potentially diminish the interest of the research community and the public in the clinical trials enterprise.   The need for more medically-trained researchers with appropriate methodological training has been identified as an important limiting factor in the scope and quality of clinical research overall and specifically in neurology.

The purpose of the “Clinical Trial Methods in Neurology” course is to increase the reliability and effectiveness of clinical trials by: introducing clinical fellows and junior faculty in any neurology or neurosurgical subspecialty to the principles of good clinical trial design; exposing early career clinical scientists to the full spectrum of challenges in clinical research; and developing a cadre of well-trained, experienced clinical researchers whose expertise will foster better clinical trials design and thereby hasten the introduction of improved regimens for therapy and prevention of neurological disorders into everyday medical practice and patient care.

It is anticipated that this annual course will yield a group of talented, dedicated neurology researchers who will consequently be in a position to obtain funding for their own high quality clinical research.  If the program is successful, it is anticipated that students will return to their academic departments where they will take a prominent role in advancing local research priorities in neurology.

Specific goals of the contract are as follows:  (1)  to develop scientific content, curriculum, and format of a comprehensive, hands-on training program;  (2)  to organize and conduct the training program, including recruitment and selection of faculty and participants;  (3)  to conduct formal evaluation of the training program.  

It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement type contract will be made for a period of five years with award on or about September 2005.  This is not a request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-05-01 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbisopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address: (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Refer to number note 26. ***

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has a requirement for an innovative approach to Executive Function (EF) measurement that will be responsive to the needs of researchers in a variety of neurological disorders and settings with a particular emphasis on measuring outcomes in clinical trials.  Executive Function (EF) refers to a constellation of cognitive abilities that include the ability to plan, organize, and sequence tasks and manage multiple tasks simultaneously. Appropriate EF also includes components of self-monitoring and self-correcting behaviors. These important behaviors are compromised in healthy elders and in people with neurological, mental and age related disorders, leading to disruption of lifestyle and loss of independence. One obstacle for progressive research in this area of cognition is a paucity of valid and reliable tasks that specifically tap domains of EF. 

While some research has been ongoing with funding from NIH, the National Science Foundation and the McDonnell Foundation, it has been difficult to establish standard operational definitions of Executive Functions, resolve areas of controversies such as the design and validation of comprehensive neuropsychological tests to assess multiple domains of Executive Function in both basic and clinical research settings. The proposed contract will take advantage of the state of our knowledge on research issues such as: neural pathways associated with executive function; appropriate animal models to study executive function; the nature, extent and rate of change of executive function in pathological states; the characterization – sparing or impairment - of executive function in neurodegenerative diseases; current tasks for assessment of executive function and the development of new tasks; factors that modulate executive function; and feasible behavioral and/or pharmacological interventions.  

The development of domain specific tasks of executive function as specified in this proposed contract will be of considerable value to many of NINDS current  and future  research programs in neurological disorders where dysfunction in cognitive processes are integral components of functional outcomes and quality of life for affected patients. While there are numerous neuropsychological test batteries, their use has been maximized in research settings with little attention paid to adaptability to clinical trials. However, some aspects of “executive function” are being incorporated into many recent or current clinical trials in neurology, usually as secondary outcome measures.  Many neuropsychological assessment scales have been developed for use in various disease settings; however, some of the existing scales have questionable validity and there is no consensus on what methods should be used within or across studies or disease areas.  The lack of consensus about the best tools or approaches creates a situation where based on the existing literature, it is not possible to compare the relative burden of various neurological conditions to each other or more importantly, to compare the relative benefits of one treatment over another on the same patient-centered outcome. Supporting a research agenda that will create a battery of domain specific Executive Function tasks would greatly increase the probability for more precise clinical assessment and integration in a large range of basic brain research. Cross-cultural issues are also important; the resulting tool must be applicable to the US Hispanic population and must be available in Spanish.  The specific goals of the proposed contract are as follows:  (1) to develop a core set of tasks that will address specific domains of Executive Function that is universal to patients with chronic neurological disorders; (2) to integrate the specific following characteristics in the NINDS Executive Function test battery:  a) focused on two or more of the following six domains:  inhibition (response suppression; interference resolution); working memory (manipulation and maintenance of information; temporal organization (time and place); set shifting (mental flexibility); self monitoring (behavioral awareness, insight); abstraction (rules, categories);  b) modifiable (depending on individual protocols or paradigms and individual differences); c) portable (battery that can be administered in emergency room; physician offices); d) programmable; replicable (flexible across laboratories); e) usable across species (rodents, monkeys, humans) and across age groups; f) adaptable for clinical trials; g) utilizes naturalistic situations (virtual reality); and g) includes functional outcomes (sensitive to treatment, training, drugs).  The proposed contract will be structured in two phases.  Phase I will encompass qualitative research focusing on the identification of content area and the development of EF domain specific tasks.  Phase II addresses the formal testing and refining of the final battery of EF tests.  It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement type contract will be made for a period of five (5) years on or about September 2005.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-05-02 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address: (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.

<DESC>The NINDS has a requirement for the continued research and development of functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) systems to restore coordinated, directed upper extremity function by synergistically controlling stimulated and voluntary movements in tetraplegic individuals with high, middle, and low cervical injuries. Evaluation of these FNS systems will be conducted in human subjects who have paralyzed upper extremities as a result of upper motor neuron lesions. A major emphasis of this work is to produce functionally relevant quantitative measures; any testing performed should primarily emphasize quantitative results rather than qualitative or descriptive research findings.

This project will focus on the sufficiency of FNS in the restoration of coordinated upper extremity function movements such as hand grasp, pronation/supination, elbow extension and shoulder movement. To make the systems practical and attractive for use, the FNS system components will need to be made fully implantable, including sensors that provide the system and/or the user with sensory feedback and a paradigm for control. The contractor shall establish safety and feasibility of the proposed approach, the ability of the FNS system to synergistically control stimulated and voluntary movements, determine the most effective sensory and control components, and determine the quantitative metrics needed for testing system efficacy in restoration of upper extremity movements in human subjects. Spinal cord injury induces changes in muscle properties that vary between individuals based on the extent of denervation and disuse.  Therefore, the following issues should be addressed: assessment of spasticity and the effects of muscle denervation, weakness, fatiguability and/or other complications on FNS system performance. While this contract does not constitute a clinical trial, it is expected that a sufficient number of human subjects will be enrolled in the study to enable statistical confidence in the findings, and establish appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria and endpoints for planning definitive efficacy trials. A major goal of this effort is to enable transition to the commercial sector of technologies that can benefit disabled individuals. Consequently, offerors will be expected to include a commercial transition plan for relevant milestones, deliverables, and accomplishments resulting from this effort.

Any resultant contractor will also be expected to cooperate with other investigators supported by the Neural Prosthesis Program (NPP) largely driven by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke as well as other institutes at the NIH. Of particular relevance to this RFP, The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to support an effort to fabricate a prototype FNS controller capable of translating motor cortical signals to signals necessary to drive a FNS system. The contractor for this RFP will be expected to collaborate with the selected NICHD performers. 

This RFP represents a competitive renewal of research efforts currently being performed under a contract with the Case Western Reserve University.

It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement type contract, with a 30-month base period, and one 30–month option period will be made on or about September 2005.  This notice is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, New York, NY.

Purpose:
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is the Federal agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that educates the public about the societal benefits of addiction treatment and promotes the message that recovery from addiction in all its forms is possible.  All activities and products produced and distributed by SAMHSA’s Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) educate their intended audience about substance use disorders as a national public health problem affecting millions of people and the crucial role addiction treatment plays in reclaiming lives ravaged by alcoholism and drug addiction.  
Due to the trends seen, there is a need to expand consumer-related outreach to youth and at-risk youth (roughly 15-18 years of age) through such mechanisms as the Partnership for Drug Free America’s consumer-related interactive Web site, Check YourselfTM (www.checkyourself.com).  The site reaches at-risk teens with a meaningful message, as well as needed information and resources.  The site is intended to interrupt early-using teens’ progression from dabbling to heavier use to dependency – seeking significant reduction in regular, habitual use of drugs and alcohol among teens.  The site includes messages to minority populations such as African American, Asian Pacific Islanders, Hispanic and American Indian populations.  Through SAMHSA/CSAT’s work with the Partnership, special emphasis on the inclusion of co-occurring and co-existing disorders as well as cultural competency is going to be added to the site content and referral information.

The Partnership for a Drug-Free America® (PDFA) is a non-profit coalition of professionals from the communications industry. Through its national drug-education advertising campaign and other forms of media communication, the Partnership exists to help kids and teens reject substance abuse by influencing attitudes through persuasive information.

National research suggests that the Partnership's national advertising campaign - the largest public service campaign in the history of advertising - has played a contributing role in reducing overall drug use in America. Independent studies and expert interpretation of drug trends support its contributions. The New York Times has described the Partnership as "one of the most effective drug-education groups in the U.S."
PDFA possesses the knowledge and established credibility within the advertising, marketing, communications and treatment industry that is needed to successfully launch a new national web site focusing on youth.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command in conjunction with the Missile Defense Agency Advanced Systems Directorate desires to award a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin Orincon Defense.  This action will sustain and enhance the target a cquisition and discrimination functions of future BMDS.      The effort to be performed under this contract is in direct support of Advanced Systems target acquisition and tracking algorithm development.  This work will apply a proprietary numerical approach to increasing the spatial resolution of radar and ele ctro-optic sensors.  This numerical approach is termed the Harmonic Structure Function, and the algorithms de-convolve the harmonic structures of multiple objects in a single beam or pixel of a radar or EO/IR sensor.  Inputs are EO/IR and RADAR sensor data  transformed from time series data to frequency spectral data and power spectral densities.  Outputs are object features that feed the Decision Architecture.  This is a relatively short-term effort that applies work completed under Phase I and Phase II MDA  Small Business Innovation Research contracts.       Note 22

<DESC>By way of this notice, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Chicago District - U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announces its intention to award a sole source follow-on contract to Mr. Edmund J. Karwatka for Technical Consulting Services in support of  our Little Calumet Construction Projects.  Mr. Karwatka has fulfilled the necessary requirements of this service under a previously awarded contractual instrument, wherein, his intimate knowledge and technical expertise of civil works projects, specifical ly, the Little Calumet Project was instrumental in aiding in the successful award of several major Little Calumet contracts.  Under Mr. Karwatkas previous contract, he conducted research, and performed technical and consulting engineering services for the  Little Calumet construction projects.  He was also charged with the technical review of the plans and specification bid sets. Mr. Karwatka has over 12+ years of civil works experience in the construction arena, which involved many years of extensive fiel d work at the Little Calumet project sites.  With Mr. Karwatkas extensive knowledge base and background of the Little Calumet project sites, coupled with our constrained timeframes by which the projects must be awarded, it is crucial that the services be acquired by an individual who possesses the necessary extensive technical capabilities and expert knowledge of the Little Calumet projects, as Mr. Karwatka has. In that regard, this agency would satisfy its major milestones and expenditure levels for FY 05 .  If this agency were to contract these services from another source, the new source would have to expend numerous months and dollars reviewing project data, technical reports, plans and specifications, and acquainting itself with the Little Calumet proje ct sites themselves.  Since this agency is working under a constrained budget and schedule, full and open competitive and contracting methods would likely result in a substantial duplication of cost (reviewing technical data, etc.) and unacceptable delays in fulfilling our agencys requirements.  To that end, Mr. Karwatka is the only available source who can provide the services in an efficient and cost effective manner so that the our ability to award contracts are not hampered by bringing a new agency on board to research and learn site specific information that Mr. Karwatka is already equipped with.   The proposed contract performance period is for approximately 12 months, with an option of an additional 12 months. It is anticipated that the resultant con tract will be firm-fixed-price.  This notice is NOT a Request for Proposals, therefore, NO solicitation documents will be issued. Award is anticipated on or about 29 April 2005.  Responses to this Notice that are submitted by interested and responsible sou rces may be considered by this agency. The Point of Contact for this action is Anita Simpkins at Telephone (312) 846-5372 or Email to: anita.r.simpkins@lrc02.usace.army.mil

<DESC>BAA 05-18 – Modification/Clarification
Biologically-Inspired Cognitive Architectures

This modification extends the initial closing date and clarifies the relationship between the newly added Thrust D (see modification 3 and PIP addendum) and the original announcement.

Revised due date for initial proposals

The due date for the initial proposals for BICA is April 25, 2005. This applies to proposals for all four thrusts in the program. We anticipate that awards will be made about August 15, 2005.

Clarifications to Mod 3 (Thrust D details and relationship to Thrusts A and B)	

1.	Participation in Technical Exchange Meetings – Thrust D

Research teams in Thrust D (either Task D1 or D2) will be expected to participate in the Technical Exchange Meetings during month 7 along with all other teams.

2.	Task Schedules: Sequential and Concurrent Tasks

Thrusts A, B, and C each have three tasks that will be performed sequentially over the 13-month period of performance. Tasks A1, B1, and C1 will be performed during the first six months; the Technical Exchange Meetings (Tasks A2, B2, and C2) will occur during the subsequent month (Month 7 of the 13-month period); Tasks A3, B3, and C3 will be performed during the last six months (Months 8-13 of the 13 month period). 

Thrust D has two tasks (D1 and D2) that will be performed concurrently over the full 13-month period.  In other words, Task D1 (both Tasks D1-1 and D1-2) will be performed during the entire 13-month period, including attendance at the Technical Exchange Meeting in Month 7; and Task D2 will be performed during the entire 13-month period, including attendance at the Technical Exchange Meeting in Month 7.

3.	Clarification of Distinction Between Thrust A and Thrust D

Thrust D deals with a specific functionality, singled out because of particular interest in experienced-based learning as the basis for more flexible knowledge representation. Thrust D is narrower and more specific than Thrust A.  Thrust D is focused on concept and schema formation from experience.  Thrust A is interested in more general models of human cognition including experience-based or episodic learning.

Both Thrust A and Thrust D are interested in designing (and eventually building) computational models of cognition, heavily influenced by the latest psychological research on human cognition.  Both thrusts are interested in modeling experienced-based or episodic learning.  However, Thrust D focuses primarily on concept and schema formation from experiences (what you might think of as forming concepts in semantic memory from episodic experiences); Thrust A is interested in all major cognitive functions including those mentioned in Thrust D, but is not limited to memory formation.  Thrust D is interested in developing flexible knowledge representation techniques to create more flexible but still “artificial” learning and reasoning systems; Thrust A is interested in creating faithful models of human cognition.
  	
Thrust D will have its own test problem, outlined in the new addendum to the PIP, that will test concept and schema formation from descriptions of experiences; Thrust A will be tested by the Cognitive Decathlon test suite that will include some test of episodic learning along with other tests of major cognitive functions and that will be administered by simulating experiences (as opposed to describing the experiences symbolically as it will be done in Thrust D).  

Thrust D also has a unique feature in that it solicits proposals, under Task D1-1, for experiments in cognitive psychology or neuroscience to discover the basic mechanisms of experienced-based learning to be modeled in Task D1-2; Thrust A only solicits work to design models of cognition using experimental results from the existing literature in cognitive psychology and neuroscience.  

Finally, Thrust A has been designed to be worked in close relationship with Thrust B while we have not yet worked out or specified how Thrust D will relate to Thrust B.  In the case of Thrust A, we are soliciting proposals for Thrust A or B individually or combined proposals for Thrust A and B together.  In the case of Thrust D, we are soliciting separate proposals for Thrust D (for either Task D1 or D2) and are not accepting combined proposals for Thrust A & D or B & D.

4.	Bidding Thrust A and/or Thrust D

We solicit proposals from bidders whose research interests, experience, and qualifications match one or more of the Thrusts of the BICA program.

For those who resonate with the detail, focus and experimental nature of Thrust D, we hope you will consider submitting a proposal for Thrust D.

Similarly, for those who see a match with the broader modeling and architecture development in Thrust A and/or the hybrid possibilities between Thrusts A and B, we hope you will consider submitting a proposal for Thrust A (and B if appropriate).  This would include work on items and issues described in Thrust D, if you are interested in designing and developing broader, more complete models of cognition as well.  If your interest is only in concept and schema formation, you should bid to Thrust D; if your interest includes experienced-based learning or episodic learning as well as other cognitive functions, you should bid Thrust A.

In general, if you read Thrust D and resonate with the specifics of that Thrust, then you should bid Thrust D.  If you read Thrust D and A and are not sure which one is a better match for your research interests, you should bid Thrust A.

If your interests and qualifications cover both general scope of Thrust A and specific focus of Thrust D, we recommend that you submit separate proposals tailored for the details of each thrust.  If you are proposing to develop a general cognitive model that includes elements of both Thrust A and D, we recommend that you propose to Thrust A.

 

Please see Figure 1 (revised) from the original Proposer Information Pamphlet
5.	Experimentation (Task D1-1)

For those interested in proposing cognitive experiments under Task D1-1, we are interested in funding a limited number of experiments designed to resolve issues critical to the design and development of cognitive models for Thrust D.  We realize that there is a wealth of existing experimental literature in cognitive psychology and neuroscience addressing the research issues outlined in Thrust D.  We are not interested in funding the continuation of general research in these areas, but are interested, instead, in very focused experiments that address issues that must be resolved to design models of the experienced-based learning system described in Thrust D. 

6.	Bidding on Task D1-1 and Task D1-2

Bidders may propose to Task D1-1, Task D1-2 or both.
 
7.	Relative Level of Emphasis for Thrust D

The dollar amount of awards will be determined by the quality of proposals and funds available. Staff years below are shown only to illustrate the relative emphasis among the different program elements. DARPA reserves the right to modify the size and composition of the Thrust D awards, based upon the merits of the proposals received. 

We anticipate that the total effort across the entire program for Thrust D1 will be about 12 FTEs.

We anticipate that the total effort for Thrust D2 will be about 4 FTEs.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation) This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this  time.    This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research  purposes only.  This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources  capable of meeting the requirements for providing a Consolidated Healthcare  Asset Management Program (CHAMP).  A proposed draft Performance Work Statement  and Air Force Material Command Services Capability Package are attached to  provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the Air Force  Material Command and the respondent’s potential ability to meet the  Government’s requirements. The medical equipment and real property maintenance support includes, but is  not limited to the maintenance (scheduled and unscheduled) necessary to keep  medical facilities and biomedical equipment at nine (9) Medical Treatment  Facility (MTF) locations in good working order. The facilities are located as  follows: 1)	Brooks City Base, TX  2)	Edwards AFB, CA  3)	Eglin AFB, FL 4)	Hanscom AFB, MA 5)	Hill AFB, UT  6)	Kirtland AFB, NM 7)	Robins AFB, GA 8)	Tinker AFB, OK  9)	Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  The contractor shall provide an equipment maintenance management program to  include, but not be limited to, management services; repair analysis and  invoice validation; payment processing including cost overrun protection;  technical assistance; statistical repair information; and program training for  the customer. The objective of the CHAMP is to reduce equipment maintenance  expenditures and provide a fixed annual budget.  This program will replace  manufacturer and third party service contracts with a comprehensive management  services program that combines the cost control protection of service  contracts with administrative and technical expertise.  The Air Force anticipates utilizing an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity  contract for this award. The period of performance for this effort is expected  to be one base year with four one-year option periods.   All respondents are required to certify if they currently meet the small  business requirements under the North American Industry Classification System  (NAICS) code 561210 Facilities Support Services, $30M, as of the date of their  proposal submittal. This requirement is a set aside for those contractors that  meet the small business NAICS 561210 certification requirement on the date of  contract award, not when they last renewed their GSA Contract.  All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly  demonstrates capabilities and expertise related to this effort.  The  capabilities package requirements are to be presented in accordance with the  attachments entitled *Capabilities Package For AFMC Support Services.  Your  package should demonstrate capabilities, expertise and past performance  relevant to the requirements cited above.  Your Capabilities Package should  not exceed 10 pages and should include the following:  Company Name; Address;  Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL;  If applicable Certification of small business status;  Please submit your responses to ASC/PKWIE, Attn:  Cherie W. See, 1940 Allbrook  Dr. Ste 3, Area C, Building 1, Room 111, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433- 5111.  Packages should be submitted no later than 2:00 pm, EST, April 1,  2005.  No facsimile responses will be accepted.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this  synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with  preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not  constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does this issuance restrict the  Government’s acquisition approach.  The Government reserves the right to  reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this  announcement.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part  of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and  present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.   If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a  solicitation will be published and posted on the Federal Business  Opportunities website.   If you have any questions, you may contact Cherie W. See at (937) 257-4774 ext  4411, e-mail: cherie.see@wpafb.af.mil or the Contracting Officer, Deborah A.  Smith at (937) 257-4774 ext 4409, e-mail:  deborah.smith@wpafb.af.mil.  Please Note: I am working on attaching the Capability Package along with the Performance  Work Statement.  They will be on the site as soon as we can work out the  computer issues not allowing me to attach these files.

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 028 (08 MAR 05)- Correction of Capt  Thompson+s phone number (reference: Amendment 027) Phone:  937-255-4560 Email:  Gary.Thompson@wpafb.af.mil  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 027 (07 MAR 05) - Draft SRD  An updated version of the draft Systems Requirement Document (SRD), Rev 3,  dated 7 March 2005 is available for review and comment.

We plan to hold these sessions 29 March  through 1 April at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure. 

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Currently U.S. licensed influenza vaccines for human usage are produced in embryonated hen’s eggs. Reliance on a single product as a substrate for influenza vaccine production has several vulnerabilities including a protracted vaccine production cycle, lethal toxicity to avian influenza viruses, and susceptibility to production drops caused by disease or nutrition. Therefore, diversification of vaccine manufacturing substrates, such as tissue culture cells and recombinant DNA expression systems may provide a more responsive and flexible influenza vaccine industry with increased overall production capacity and ability to provide ample vaccine supply rapidly in the event of an influenza pandemic. 
       
The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to develop domestically manufactured cell- or recombinant DNA-based influenza vaccine leading towards FDA-licensure and human usage. The scope of activities that the Offeror may request funds may include manufacturing, clinical evaluation of pilot and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccine using tissue culture cell or recombinant DNA expression system substrates. Funds may be used also for scale-up development and manufacturing facility design but not facility construction. 

Contracts will be awarded to influenza vaccine manufacturers that have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. or partnerships with companies having vaccine manufacturing facilities in the U.S. to provide U.S. pandemic influenza preparedness. Other eligibility requirements of vaccine manufacturers for these contracts include the following: (1) Documented history of successful development and licensure of vaccines for human usage; (2) Vaccine program that includes influenza vaccine candidates for seasonal or pandemic influenza that have successfully completed safety and immunogenicity human clinical trials (Phase I); (3) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, clinical development, and FDA-licensure of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage in the U.S. market; and (4) Documented comprehensive development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 
       
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate the final stage development leading towards FDA-licensure of new influenza vaccines in U.S. based manufacturing facilities. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three to five years or 36 - 60 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-04 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with RFP No. DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-04, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice. Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of October 2005.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Although domestic vaccine supply and usage has gradually risen over the past decade and incremental expansion of domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity is anticipated over the next decade, private sector investment in surge capacity to meet the vaccine requirement in a pandemic is unlikely. 
       
One means to increase vaccine capacity is to increase the yield of vaccine product incrementally at various stages in the vaccine manufacturing process. Further modifications of present influenza vaccine manufacturing processes may be productive in increasing product stability. Taken together these improvements could have positive impacts on surge capacity during times of vaccine shortage and in the event of an influenza pandemic. 
       
The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple contract awards to improve the manufacturing process of influenza vaccines to achieve greater product yields and potentially shorter production cycles. Contracts will be awarded to influenza vaccine manufacturers or their corporate partners, which have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. and which plan and implement a coordinated and integrated systematic strategy to enhance influenza vaccine manufacturing. The vaccine manufacturing activities that may be pursued include raw material selection and qualification, upstream processing, downstream processing, vaccine formulation, and final product presentation. Other activities supported by this RFP include manufacturing, clinical evaluation, and validation of pilot investigational and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccines manufactured by the improved processes. 

Eligibility requirements of vaccine manufacturers for these contracts include the following: (1) Licensure and manufacturing of vaccines for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, clinical development, and FDA-licensure of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage in the U.S. market; and (3) Documented development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 
       
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to expand the domestic influenza vaccine capacity for seasonal and pandemic influenza. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-07 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with RFP No. DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-07, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice. Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of September 2005.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government.  An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Currently, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines are comprised of 15 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) for each included virus strain and are administered intramuscularly. Studies recently have shown that antigen sparing effects have been elicited for monovalent influenza vaccines formulated with adjuvants and trivalent influenza vaccines administered intradermally. Antigen sparing approaches may increase overall influenza vaccine capacity in the short term by reducing the amount of HA antigen that may be needed in the vaccine by using adjuvants or by administering vaccines by alternate routes such as intradermally.   

The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to develop medical devices and/or domestically- manufactured antigen sparing influenza vaccines for FDA licensure and human usage. The scope of activities for which the Offeror may request funds may include manufacturing and clinical evaluation of pilot and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccine using adjuvants or other immune enhancing substances. Funds may be used also for vaccine and medical device development and testing. 

Contracts will be awarded to companies or their corporate partners that have U.S. manufacturing facilities available for influenza vaccines, adjuvants, and/or medical devices, which may afford an antigen sparing effect. Other eligibility requirements of manufacturers and their corporate partners, if applicable, for these contracts include the following: (1) Documented history of development and clinical testing of vaccines, adjuvants, or medical devices for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing and clinical development leading toward FDA-licensure of pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage; and (3) Documented comprehensive development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 

The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate late stage development and testing leading toward FDA-licensure of new antigen sparing influenza vaccines in U.S.-based manufacturing facilities. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-08 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with RFP No. DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-08, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice. Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of September, 2005.

<DESC>This solicitation is being offered to encourage interested parties to develop a dispersal system mounted on a fixed wing aircraft to apply Disrupt II (pheromone flakes) using Gelva 2333 as a sticker.  Current technology for applying the pheromone flakes and sticker is the Hercon pod mounted on fixed-wing aircraft (Air Tractor).  Due to availability of the components and the complexity of the pods, there is a need to develop flake dispersal systems using technology that is more readily available.  The dispersal system must be designed, built and mounted on a fixed wing aircraft and meet the criteria i.e. calibration and characterization, before it will be considered for use under this solicitation.  This solicitation is to test the operational readiness of new flake/sticker dispersal system technology.    Potential test blocks may be located in the following states: North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.  The treatment acreage will be confined to one state for each prospective bidder.  Areas selected for treatment under this proposal will be identified in the RFP.  Application is expected to occur sometime between mid June to early July 2005. One application of Disrupt II at two rates will be applied to approximately 10,000 acres in treatment blocks located in the Slow the Spread (STS) action area in 2005.  All technical questions should be addressed to Donna Leonard at (828) 257-4329 or Dee Dee Sellers at (540) 432-8245.

<DESC>This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) and no formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this request will be issued.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) will not issue paper copies of this request.  The responses to this RFI will be considered in the planning and definition of future technology development programs for which either the current ONR Long Range Broad Agency Announcement (BAA 05-001) or a later solicitation may play a part.  This is not a commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request.  The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request.  

Communications technology that can provide seamless, robust, connectivity is at the foundation of the Sea Power 21 and FORCEnet Vision “... to have the right information, at the right place, at the right time ...”   The performance of Command and Control (C2) systems and decision making at all levels of command depend critically on reliable, interoperable, survivable, secure and timely communications and networking.   The availability of high capacity multimedia (voice, data, imagery) communication networks is fundamental to nearly all Department of Navy missions. The current evolution of naval warfighting from a platform-centric to a network-centric paradigm depends on successfully meeting the implied need for significantly enhanced communications and networking capabilities, extending both to fixed shore facilities and to highly mobile air, surface, land and subsurface platforms, including the so-called “disadvantaged user” (e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, dispersed ground units, etc.).  

The goal of the Communications and Networking Program within the Office of Naval Research (ONR 313) is to support the FORCEnet vision by developing measurable advances in technology that can directly enable and enhance the connectivity among widely dispersed naval, joint, allied and coalition forces. With an overarching emphasis on wireless terrestrial, maritime and satellite communications and networking, ONR 313 is seeking white papers for potential FY 06 Exploratory Development/Applied Research (Budget category 6.2) projects under the following focus areas: (i) high bit rate, small size/weight/power, communications technologies and techniques for highly mobile sensors in maritime/littoral environment, (ii) protocols and techniques for resilient mobile internetworking of UAVs to extend surveillance range and battlespace connectivity, and (iii) end-to-end Quality-of-Service (QoS) that accommodates divergent requirements of multiple users and applications on capacity-constrained, shared networks using dissimilar radio bearers (SATCOM, Tactical Digital Information Links, etc.) and dynamically changing topologies. 

White papers should not exceed 4 pages (exclusive of cover page) and should contain the following information: cover page labeled “White Paper” with RFI number 05-SS-0001, technical point of contact, telephone number, fax numbers, and e-mail address; the technical concept of project; what's new; technical objectives of project and its potential relevance to Navy/Marines; period of performance for effort; total and annual project rough cost estimates (i.e., top level that does not include proprietary cost data); and a 1-page CV of the principal investigator.  White papers submitted in response to this RFI are expected to be unclassified.  However, confidential/classified white papers are permitted.   The white paper submissions will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 15.207, applicable law, and DoD/DoN regulations.  Submitters are expected to appropriately mark each page of their submission that contains proprietary information.

White papers should be submitted to the program coordinator, Ms. Sheila Richardson, ONR 313, telephone (703) 696-0113, E-mail sheila_richardson@onr.navy.mil either in hard copy (with one original and two copies) or via email.  In order to be considered for potential FY’06 funded projects, white papers should be submitted no later than close of business on April 06, 2005.  White papers received after April 06, 2005 may be considered for FY’07 funded program. 

It is anticipated that 2-3 projects to start in FY’06 will be considered and that these projects will generally range from one to three years in duration with an estimated start date of November 2005 and annual project amounts between $300,000 to $500,000.  However, lower or higher cost projects would be considered. 

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant Science and Technical Point of Contact, Dr. Santanu Das, Communications and Networking Program Officer, Code ONR 313, ONR, 800 North Quincy St., Arlington, VA 22217, telephone (703) 588-1036, email: Santanu_Das@onr.navy.mil.  The technical point of contact will not accept any white papers or proposals.

<DESC>This is a request for information only. It is not a solicitation nor does it guarantee a solicitation will be issued.  The 99th Contracting Squadron, Nellis AFB NV, is conducting market research for F/A-22 instrumentation maintenance for the 422 Test and Evaluation Squadron (422 TES) of the USAF Air Warfare Center (AWFC) located on Nellis AFB NV.  The 422 TES (under the 53rd Wing) conducts operational test and evaluation (OT&E), tactics development and evaluation (TD&E), operational utility evaluations (OUE) and special program evaluations of fighter weapon systems. These projects comprise the AWFC contribution to the USAF Combat Developments Program. Units of the 53rd Wing perform these functions with most of the Nellis activities being associated with operations on the Nellis Ranges.  
The 53rd Wing, 53rd Test and Evaluation Group (TEG) performs recurring weekly test sorties using 5 different type aircraft at Nellis AFB, Nevada (F/A-22, F-15C, F-15E, F-16, and A-10). The CB-coded (test aircraft) are all unique due to the T-2 modifications that have been performed to accomplish the test missions.   
For this effort, all contractor employees must possess TOP SECRET / SCI clearances prior to commencing work.  

The objective of this effort is for the contractor to maintain the F/A-22 instrumentation system to include: 1) Instrumentation Data Acquisition Package (IDAP); 2) Air-to-Air Range Instrumentation (AARI) pallet; 3) Aircraft instrumentation group-A provisions (orange wire and telemetry antennas associated with IDAP, AARI and beacon).  The contractor will perform IDAP functional checks, cockpit integrity checks between the IDAP and AARI pallet, pre-mission installation and post-mission download of Solid State Recorders (SSR), minor repair of test assets (IDAP, AARI components, group-A provisions) and IDAP uploading and downloading.

The contractor shall be expected to provide instrumentation maintenance services for 5 IDAPs / 7 AARI pallets on the 7 422 TES CB-coded F/A-22 test aircraft.  To ensure adequate instrumentation support, the contractor will normally be expected to provide 2-shift coverage.  The shift schedules should be based on the normal flying hour window (typically 2-go’s in 10 hour period), Monday through Friday.  The contractor will be expected to flex the shift schedules according to the flying schedule, to include periodic night flying operations. On occasion the contractor will be required to work weekends and travel to various locations (Seattle, WA; Edwards AFB, CA; etc).  The government plans to instrument all Nellis F/A-22 sorties; IDAP, SSR and AARI flashcards installed.  Expected sortie rate is 4-turn-2 with 1 spare instrumented aircraft per go (5 instrumented aircraft at start of each flying day).

Specific tasks to be performed by the contractor include:

Instrumentation Management.   The contractor will be expected to provide overall instrumentation management, acting as the liaison between the Raptor Ops division and the Raptor AMU to coordinate instrumentation requirements, schedules, maintenance plans and other management functions as determined by the Raptor Ops division.  57 AMXS / MXAC (Raptor Maintenance Production Office) will coordinate all on-aircraft activities to include permitting access to the aircraft and IDAP movements.

Functional Checks.  Prior to the start of each flying day, the contractor will perform IDAP / AARI functional checks.  

Post-Mission Download.  At the completion of each flight, the contractor will retrieve / download the SSRs and AARI flashcards, upload blank SSRs and flashcards and deliver the removed items to the F/A-22 vault.

IDAP Movement.  The contractor will be tasked to upload or move the IDAP from storage to aircraft or moved between aircraft.  Expect two IDAP uploads / downloads per week.

Instrumentation Maintenance.  As required, the Raptor Ops division will task the contractor to accomplish troubleshooting / repair of the Raptor instrumentation system (IDAP, AARI, group-A provisions as previously defined).  This organizational level on-equipment troubleshooting / repair will consist of identifying the problem, removal / replacement of “black boxes”, circuit cards, repair connectors, troubleshoot wiring, etc.  The goal is for the contractor to develop sufficient expertise to become autonomous in maintaining the instrumentation system (IDAP, AARI, aircraft group-A provisions).  When a problem exceeds the expertise of the contractor, the contractor will be expected to take advantage of the F/A-22 Action Request (AR) system (technical assistance provided by a third-party contractor) to assist in troubleshooting the instrumentation to the maximum extent.  In the event that the contractor is unable to resolve an instrumentation issue (and have used the AR process), the F/A-22 prime contractor may elect to provide an on-site technician / engineer.  The instrumentation contractor will be tasked to assist the on-site instrumentation engineer / technician in attempting to resolve the issue.  If all of these attempts are unsuccessful, the contactor will prepare the IDAP for shipment to the designated repair facility. The government intends to provide all shipping and packing materials and pay for the shipment.

If you feel you can provide these services, please submit a capabilities package (please limit capabilities package to 10 pages maximum) to the following recipients: Captain David Huber, 99 CONS/LGCC, at david.huber@nellis.af.mil; Captain Kevin Nelson, 59 TES/ENE, at kevin.nelson@nellis.af.mil; 1Lt David Rohlinger, 99 CONS/LGCC, at david.rohlinger@nellis.af.mil.  Capabilities packages should be submitted electronically, and should be submitted no later than 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time, on Friday, April 1, 2005.

Within your capabilities package, please address the following questions:

1.	The Government is investigating contract types for this effort.  What contract type do you feel is appropriate for this effort, and why?
2.	Please provide your business size.  If a small business, please also provide your small business status (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned, woman owned, etc.).
3.	If a solicitation for this effort were issued, would your organization submit a proposal as a prime contractor or a subcontractor?
4.	What percentage of this effort would be appropriate for a small business set-aside?
5.	Based on tasks described above, please provide a range on how much you estimate this effort to cost over a five-year contract period (if practical, please break down cost by year).
6.	Please describe your background with F/A-22 instrumentation maintenance.
7.	Please discuss security clearances for your personnel.  Do your personnel currently hold TOP SECRET / SCI clearances in order begin work immediately upon contract award?
  
Your participation in this market research is greatly appreciated.  However, submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and shall not constitute a fee to the Government.  If you have any questions about this request for information, please contact Captain David Huber at (702) 652-3366, or 1Lt David Rohlinger at (702) 652-3368.

<DESC>SFAE-CSS-TV-M							18 March 2005 	The Product Manager, Tactical Vehicles is seeking data on existing capabilities in performing the roles of Performance Based Logistics Product Support Integrator-Product Support Provider. 	In September 2001, the Quadrennial Review (QDR) mandated implementation of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) with appropriate metrics to compress the supply chain, eliminate non value added steps and improve readiness for major weapon systems and commodit ies.  PBL delineates outcome performance goals of weapon systems, ensures that responsibilities are assigned, provides incentives for attaining these goals and facilitates the overall life cycle management of system reliability, supportability and Total Ow nership Costs. 	In a 16 August memo, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics published guidance for purchasing weapon system logistic support using performance based guidance.  This guidance stated in part, for PBL, performance is defined  in terms of military objectives, using the following criteria: a.	Operational Availability.  The percent of time a weapon system is available for a mission or ability to sustain operations tempo. b.	Operational Reliability:  The measure of a weapon system in meeting mission success objectives (Percent of objectives met by weapon system) Depending on the weapon system, a mission objective could be a sortie, tour, launch, destination reached, capabil ity, etc. c.	Cost Per Unit Usage:  The total operating cost divided by the appropriate unit of measurement for a given weapon system.  Depending on the weapon system, the measurement could be flight hour, steaming hour, launch, mile driven hour operated, etc. d.	Logistics Footprint:  The government/ contractor size or presence of logistics support required to deploy, sustain and move a weapon system.  Measurable elements include inventory/ equipment, tools/special tools, personnel, facilities, transportation as sets and real estate. e.	Logistics Response Time:  This is the period of time from logistics demand signal sent to satisfaction of the logistics demand. Logistics Demand refers to systems, components, or resources, including labor required for weapon systems logistics support . The purpose of this survey is to solicit your interest, current capability, potential growth and intended processes for entering in a Performance Based Logistics Contract/Agreement to support one or more of our weapon systems. Performance Based Logistics Market Survey Questionnaire This market survey questionnaire relates the Product Manager, Medium Tactical Vehicles, need to identify potential Product Support Providers  Product Support Integrators to support the Armys line of Medium Tactical Vehicle (MTV) trucks and the Armored Se curity Vehicle (ASV).  The Medium Truck Fleet consists of the, Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), and the M939 5 ton trucks.  The FMTV consists of the 2 ½ ton Light Medium Tactical Vehicles (LMTV) and the 5 ton MTV.  The LMTVs include cargos and va ns (Models 1078 to M1081).  The MTVs consist of cargos, tractors, dumps, wreckers and vans (Models M1078 through the M1094) and the new production variants with production quantities anticipated to be over 12,000.  The FMTV also contains trailers Models 10 82 and M1095.  The total quantities of FMTV vehicles and trailers represented are approximately 37,000.  The M939/A1/A2 5 Ton truck family consists of the cargos, tractors, dumps, wreckers and vans models M923 through the M934 (approximately 38,000 vehicle s).

Solicitation No. ADM-05-403 herein is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This RFP is set aside for small businesses only.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 561920 and the small business size standard is $6M.  The NRC intends to issue a Commercial Item, Fixed Price Type Contract with a base period and one option period.   

BACKGROUND

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioners will hold two meetings for all Headquarters employees on May 11, 2005 followed by an awards ceremony the afternoon of 
May 12, 2005.  All set-up work under Basic Requirements of this agreement shall be completed by May 8, 2005 as May 9 and 10, 2005 are used by the NRC to set-up and test  communications and sound equipment.  Both of these events will be held on The Green, an area located between NRC's two Headquarters buildings at 11555 (OWFN Building) and 11545 Rockville Pike (TWFN Building), Rockville, located directly across Marinelli Road from the White Flint Metrorail station.

The NRC requires the Contractor to provide the following logistical support for these events:  		
BASIC  REQUIREMENTS

1.  TENTS

The Contractor shall provide a tent or a series of connecting tents to cover 750 or more seated employees, 28' x 16' stage, with space for large aisles, microphones, speakers, two 2' x 5' sound control tables at rear of tent, and a separate communications support area (approximately 15' X 30'.  See the attached diagram of previous set-up (Enclosure 1)  (Note: In this diagram there is a large sculpture which is 20' high.  The tents must be erected over or around this structure.)  The tents shall be completely white (no design) with appropriate height (lowest tent poles raised to approximately 10') to create an open meeting environment.  Clear siding shall be installed on all perimeter sides of the tents except for the side facing Rockville Pike.  Two layers of opaque white siding shall be installed on the Rockville Pike tents’ side.  The siding shall be securely installed on all sides to prevent flapping, including areas over vents.  The siding shall be quickly adjustable to provide entry/exit and opening/closing for changing weather conditions.  The Contractor shall also provide opaque siding in the interior of the tent located by the sculpture, as directed by the Project Officer.  This interior siding is used to conceal working communications support staff and equipment.  			 

A canopy (an entrance marquee) shall be erected from the main tent entrance to the TWFN building overhang to protect employees in case of inclement weather.  The canopy shall be approximately 10' in width extending to 15'- 20' at the entrance to TWFN to allow additional space for disabled employee entry by ramp.  The canopy may not be attached to the building or concrete pavers.

The tents, canopies and siding shall be odorless, leak, weather and fire proof and be free of unsightly wear or other markings.  Gutters shall be securely installed between tents to prevent water dripping on tent occupants. The contractor may be asked by NRC to test the performance of the gutters prior to the event by spraying water by hose on the top of the tents.  The tents, canopies and siding shall be secured to the optimum level to withstand high winds prevalent in this area; water barrels are recommended for tent anchoring. (Note: The Green area where the tent is to be installed rests over an underground parking garage.  There is approximately 12" of soil over several feet of styrofoam-type material.)

The Contractor shall ensure appropriate measures are taken to prevent any damage to the location’s landscaping and plants while erecting and disassembling the tent: the Contractor shall be responsible for any damage. The contractor shall not attach tents, canopies or other equipment to trees or buildings.  The Contractor will advise the NRC in advance if stakes will be used to anchor the tent and the NRC will mark the Green with the location of the installed underground sprinkler system.  The contractor is responsible for any damage to NRC’s sprinkler system if the damage occurs within 12 inches of the marked locations.

Any interior tent support poles shall minimize extruding wires or ropes that could trip tent occupants.  The Contractor shall allow speakers for sound equipment to be attached to tent support poles and rails as long as such attachment does not damage the poles or affect tent support.  The contractor shall also allow NRC to attach stage decorations to the tent poles and rails at the back of the platform, if desired.

The Contractor shall be responsible for meeting any federal, county or city code, regulation or licensing requirements in providing these items and services and shall obtain any necessary approvals from the Montgomery County Fire Marshal prior to the meeting.  The Contractor shall provide exit signs and any other safety items required to meet codes and regulations.  The Contractor shall provide insurance that covers personal injury to occupants.  

Following the event, the Contractor shall empty any water barrels used in locations approved by the Project Officer to ensure appropriate drainage.

The tents may be erected beginning May 5, 2005 and shall be fully erected and ready for NRC’s use by 5:00 p.m., May 8, 2005.  The tents shall be disassembled and removed from the premises no later than 5:00 p.m., May 13, 2005.  The Contractor’s  access to the site shall be coordinated and approved by the NRC Project Officer.		

2.  STAGE

Identify ALL contracts that your firm has been awarded that were terminated for default, or subject to any disputes, if “none,” indicate “none.” At the discretion of NRC, the NRC may or may not contact the sources identified on the Questionnaires regarding past performance information.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Request for Proposal number is HSCG89-05-R-6F9006 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS is 481212.  The small business sized standard is 1,500 employees.  The contract type will be a firm fixed price contract.  The Government proposes to solicit offers for the following services and quantities:

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:  The Contractor shall re-fuel Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the three Areas of Operation (AOR), they are Valdez, Juneau and Kodiak .  This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  The National Voice Distress System Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter.  There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season.  Typical transportation of propane to these sites usually includes the use of a barge and/or helicopter.  Normally full pickle barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the mountaintop by a helicopter rated for that load carrying capacity.  A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane to the 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks at a site are at maximum capacity or fuel gauge reads between 80-85%.  A typical tank is filled to maximum capacity between 80-85%.  Fuel quantity estimate is conservative and already adjusted for the seasonal temperature changes and altitude. All sites should be filled to capacity, if fuel is delivered within required timeframes.  The contractor shall provide for all services, materials and equipment, personnel, transportation and propane. Contractor shall record and document actual gallons of propane delivered to each site and tank gauge level percentages after filling.  All documentation will be delivered to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative within one week of work completion.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

The Request for Proposal number is HSCG89-05-R-6F9006 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS is 481212.  The small business sized standard is 1,500 employees.  The contract type will be a firm fixed price contract.  The Government proposes to solicit offers for the following services and quantities:

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:  The Contractor shall re-fuel Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the three Areas of Operation (AOR), they are Valdez, Juneau and Kodiak .  This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  The National Voice Distress System Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter.  There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season.  Typical transportation of propane to these sites usually includes the use of a barge and/or helicopter.  Normally full pickle barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the mountaintop by a helicopter rated for that load carrying capacity.  A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane to the 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks at a site are at maximum capacity or fuel gauge reads between 80-85%.  A typical tank is filled to maximum capacity between 80-85%.  Fuel quantity estimate is conservative and already adjusted for the seasonal temperature changes and altitude. All sites should be filled to capacity, if fuel is delivered within required timeframes.  The contractor shall provide for all services, materials and equipment, personnel, transportation and propane. Contractor shall record and document actual gallons of propane delivered to each site and tank gauge level percentages after filling.  All documentation will be delivered to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative within one week of work completion.

QUESTION: If Naked Island starts 1 April, can Pt. Pigot also start 1 April to make the fueling more economical (i.e.: not mobilize resources twice for the same area).
 
ANSWER: No, the United States Coast Guard does not want to fuel Pigot in April 2005 because it is in a 12-13 month fueling cycle which allows fueling at the site in Aug-Sep, when no snow is present.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 001 TO THE	COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR MOLYBDENUM-RHENIUM POWDER METALLURGY MATERIALS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to extend the proposal due date and answer questions. Question 1:   On the specifications, item 7 indicates a helium leak test but the tubes will be open ended so it would impossible to do a leak check until the tubes are put into the sealed assembly. Answer 1:  For an open tube, here are two examples for a helium leak test:  1) Make the tube a ¼” longer to put a mechanical metal compression fitting on the open end to seal it for the test (and then cut off the compression fitting when done).  2) Use a gasket slip on compression fitting (that doesn't bite into the pipe) to seal the open end for the test.  For the second method, since it uses a non metallic gasket for the seal, there will be helium permeation issues which govern how quick the test should be done and other issues to be resolved.	 Question 2:  Are there any drawings associated with the specification. Answer 2:  No, dimensions are given for the tubing and rod stock. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to March 29, 2005. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on March 31, 2005.	Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

Noncompliance may raise doubt regarding an offeror’s performance capabilities and may be grounds to eliminate the quote from consideration for contract award.  Quotes must be complete, self-sufficient, and respond directly to the requirement of the RFQ.  The response shall consist of two sections:  (1) Price and (2) Past Performance.  The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, initial quote should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price standpoint.  Submitted documents must be fully responsive to and consistent with the requirement of this RFQ.  (A)  Price Quote:  The offeror must provide a price for the each deliverable listed above (i.e., (1), (2), & (3)); (B).   Past Performance:  Please submit at least two references that can provide relevant past performance information.  Relevant information is the same or a similar type service as described in this combined synopsis/solicitation.  Past performance information, must include contract number, points of contact with telephone numbers and other information the offeror deem relevant for same or similar service described in this combined synopsis/solicitation.  BASIS FOR AWARD:  Award will be based upon price and past performance.  Each offeror’s quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness.  Price will always be an important factor; therefore, offerors should make diligent efforts to control costs and submit fairly priced quotes.  Past performance will be evaluated based on relevancy (size/scope/complexity), quality of product/service, timeliness of delivery/performance and business relations (customer service).  To be considered for award an offeror must have a satisfactory or better past performance record based upon information available to the contracting officer.  The Contracting Officer shall assign one of the following Performance Confidence Assessment Ratings (PCAR) for each offeror:
      Rating	                          Description
High Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has high confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Significant Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Satisfactory Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems.
Unknown Confidence	No performance record is identifiable.
Little Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
No Confidence	Based on the offeror’s record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

Award may be made to other than the low offeror when, after evaluating past performance, the contracting officer determines it to be in the government’s best interest.
