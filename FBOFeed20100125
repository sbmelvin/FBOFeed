<p>This information is for solicitation SPM1C1-10-R-0068. The item is T-Shirt, PTU, Air Force. NSN: 8415-01-518-4764(S) Military Spec: CRFD/PD 04-09, pattern date is listed as June 23, 2004.

The first delivery order is due 90 days after the date of the award. The destination for the item is VSTZ Travis, Austin, TX.</p>
<p><br />CAUTION NOTICE</p>
<p>In the past, most Best Value Clothing and Textile solicitations utilized Best Value Trade Off Procedures, however, this acquisition is utilizing the Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Best Value Method. As such, no "trade off" applies and the Government intends to award to the low priced firm who is compliant with terms of the solicitation, and deemed "technically acceptable." Also, unlike previous acquisitions for commercial items, there will be no allowable re-submittals for PDM and only firms with satisfactory or better PDMs will be eligible for award. Technical Acceptability is being defined herein as satisfactory, very good or exceptional PDMs. All PDMs will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria outlined in the solicitation.</p>
<p>From among technically acceptable firms, the Government will then select the lowest price offeror and determine if that firm is responsible, complies with terms and conditions of the solicitation and an award to them is in the best interest of the Government. If that firm fits these criteria, award will be made to them. If not, the Government will review each subsequent technically acceptable low priced offer until one is identified that does meet the criteria, in which case award will be made to that firm.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with a competitive range group of offerors from among technically acceptable firms, based on price. If negotiations are conducted, award will be made to low priced offer (based on final proposal revision closing, date/time) that is technically acceptable, responsible and compliant with solicitation terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Solicitation will be issued as a Total Small Business Set Aside utilizing the Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Best Value Method. Successful offeror(s) will be awarded the entire contract, therefore, offeror must offer on base year and all option years.</p>
<p>Availability of solicitations, FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. Offeror should register to receive notification of this solicitation or solicitation amendments. Copies of this solicitation can be found on the DIBBS website at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/ AFTER February 8, 2010. From the DIBBS homepage, select "RFP/IFBs" from the main heading toolbar.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) propose to procure a service contract for a Delta Advantage with UC-2 and computer from Thermo Electron Scientific Instruments LLC.  The Clinical Core Mass Spectrometry laboratory runs all of the clinical stable isotope studies for NIDDK and collaborating NIH Institutes. We currently analyze all of the samples on only two Thermo Electron isotope ratio mass spectrometers. The combination of the number of samples and the time it takes to analyze these samples on the mass spectrometer means that these instruments are continually in demand.  Therefore it is of utmost importance to maintain the two stable isotope mass spectrometers in optimum performance.  Repairing or maintaining isotope ratio mass spectrometers requires years of specialized training, experience, and replacement parts. Thermo Electron in the United States is the only company that has service people trained to work on Thermo isotope ratio mass spectrometers.

<p>The U. S.

Many builders and factory built housing manufacturers possess significant capacity to construct housing built to a wide range of requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Absent a customer definition of their desired performance level, those decisions are typically left to the designer/builder or, at a baseline level, the building code.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although most types of disaster housing are built to government or industry standards or building codes, those standards or codes may not establish consistent standards for construction. For housing constructed to house disaster victims, identification of a body of requirements reflecting accepted performance goals would speed design and construction as well as local acceptance and implementation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ideally, the performance levels selected would be more rigorous than any basic building code, providing additional confidence in the structural and health performance of the home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because this effort could be applied across a variety of housing types, any potential stigma between unit types would be lessened and units could be provided based on the family requirements (size, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of this project would be a body of performance requirements that could be integrated into virtually any procurement for housing products. Unlike some related efforts in the past, these requirements would be used by the Federal government in their procurement efforts and would inform the discussion of other housing stock. The work requirements will be set out in the Statement of Work which will be within the Request for Quotations (RFQ).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed Purchase Order is for a performance period of 34 weeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710, and the <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">size standard is 500 Employees</strong>. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Solicitation package will be available on or about February 9, 2010.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Projected requirements: 1) Maintenance of the Repository for Mouse Models of Cytogenetic Disorders or Cytogenetic Resource.  2)  Breed various strains of mice with known genetic background, which will produce chromosomally unbalanced gametes, resulting in trisomic and monosomic embryos with special emphasis on chromosome 16, but including relevant regions of chromosome 17 and chromosome 10.  3) Refine procedures to cryopreserve embryos that will be rescued by thawing and re-implanting them in pseudo-pregnant mice. The Contractor should evaluate the fertility of both male and female mice for optimal methods of maintaining individual mouse strains at least semiannually. 4) Distribute the animal models to qualified investigators approved by the NICHD.  5) Test the animals periodically for pathogens. 6)  Publicize the availability of mouse models indicating the type of strains in the colony as well as detailed information about the strain phenotype, genotype, protocols for genotyping, husbandry conditions, and other details as specified by the Project Officer. This information should be made available via the internet. 7) Continue to characterize the clinical and behavioral phenotype of the mouse models to ensure integrity of the strains, especially for any new strains offered by the Contractor or as specified by the Project Officer.

Capability Statement/Information Sought: Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following technical areas of experience and expertise: 

1.	Experience: Provide evidence of successfully breeding, maintaining, and distributing mice that produce partial trisomy with special emphasis on the Ts65Dn mouse strain. Provide successful documentation of the phenotypic and behavioral equivalence of the Ts65Dn strain in which the Pde6brd1 (retinal degeneration) gene has been successfully removed to the original Ts65Dn strain, for large-scale future distribution and a plan to effect this transition. In addition, evidence of successfully cryopreserving embryos and implanting them into pseudo-pregnant mice to produce viable progeny should also be provided. Provide documentation of prior ability to maintain mice in a healthy, pathogen-free state.
2.	Facilities: The offeror must demonstrate that it has facilities and equipment for breeding, maintaining, and distributing mice that produce partial trisomy, including adequate computer documentation and processing of requests, and a system for timely completion of orders for mice.

3.	Other specific capabilities to be demonstrated are: the ability to identify, maintain, and breed mice carrying balanced Robertsonian fusion chromosomes producing whole chromosome aneuploidies and partial trisomies involving chromosome 16, and when available, chromosomes 10 and 17.  The offeror must have reliable, cost-effective protocols for genotyping mice. 

Interested organizations that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit an electronic copy in addition to four (4) hard copies of their capability statement, addressing the areas above. Please limit responses to fifteen (15) pages or less. Any proprietary information should be so marked. Written capability statements should be received by the Contracting Officer by no later than 3:00PM local time on February 11, 2010.

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement.
<p>Background. The World Health Organization (WHO) is now revising the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, currently in its 10th version (ICD-10) (WHO, 1992). WHO's Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse (MSD) has responsibility for the revision of two chapters of the ICD-10: Chapter V, Mental and Behaivoural Disorders, and Chapter VI, Diseases of the Nervous System. While the overall ICD is scheduled for approval by the World Health Assembly in 2014, MSD also envisions important intermediate products such as a clinically useful system for identification of people in need of mental health services in primary care settings, particularly in low and middle income countries.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is seeking information on all sources capable of a developing a clinically useful classification system of mental disorders to identify people in need of mental health services in primary care settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>One goal of this initiative will be to consider whether correspondence can be created between a clinically useful classification of mental disorders for global primary care and the overarching typologies of mental disorders that have already been described and will continue to emerge from NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project. RDoC is an important new planned/emerging initiative in the NIMH Strategic Plan. It is anticipated that the development of a clinically useful mental health classification system under this initiative will enhance the objectives of the emerging RDoC project, and in turn be informed by the domains developed by RDoC as it progresses.</p>
<p>Focusing on clinical utility as an overarching priority, formative field studies will be designed to address three (3) broad goals: (1) how disorder categories should be organized to inform decisions about the overall architecture of the classification system by examining the relationship of possible structures to clinicians' conceptualizations of mental disorders and their clinical management. This requirement would focus in part on whether it is possible to construct a clinically useful classification for mental disorders for global primary care that is consistent with current knowledge regarding brain circuits that are thought to be important in mental disorders, the focus of RDoC; (2) which disorders, conditions, or problems should be included in a diagnostic system to facilitate appropriate identification and treatment of mental and behavioral disorders at each level of care-mental health specialty, primary care, or RDoC-related research. The primary care classification will involve specification of classification entities that may be different from entities used by specialists, as well as developing algorithms for cross-linkage of primary care, specialist, and research categories. Studies in primary care settings will focus on obtaining the best coverage of high-incidence and high-resource mental health problems, some of which may be most usefully described at the level of problems or symptom clusters rather than by formal diagnoses. Existing knowledge and hypotheses about underlying brain systems will also be considered in order to simplify, clarify, and reduce the number of mental disorder diagnoses essential for global primary care; and (3) how each disorder should be defined and described to offer maximum utility for primary care clinicians and their patients.</p>
<p>A number of alternatives to existing diagnostic approaches have been proposed as ways to improve the clinical utility of diagnostic systems, including dimensional ratings and prototype matching. It is likely that a mix of models will be required to classify, diagnose and shape management decisions for mental disorders (Parker et al., 2008). Studies will focus on the comparative clinical utility of different approaches in specific settings and for different purposes, including mental health specialty, primary care, and RDoC-related research.</p>
<p>Project Requirements. Qualified sources will be required to: 1) Establish several international field study centers in low-, middle-, and high-income countries; 2) Develop, translate, and pilot test specific protocols for a clinically useful classification of mental disorders for global primary care; 3) Develop plans for implementation, data management, and analysis; and 4) Interact and collaborate with NIMH and other investigators on the RDoC project as this initiative progresses.</p>
<p>Other important considerations. In order to perform this work, qualified sources shall have:</p>
<p>1) The capability to access and improve the clinical utility of the diagnostic system for mental and behavioral disorders in the revision of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th version<br />2) The infrastructure to establish international field study centers in low, middle, and high-income countries<br />3) Current international collaborations with investigators who have a record of productive research and international collaboration focused on the diagnosis of mental and behavioral disorders.<br />4) Experience/expertise in: diagnosis of mental disorders, psychiatry, clinical psychology or counseling psychology</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance. The resulting contract has an anticipated period of performance of 3 years.</p>
<p>Capability Statement. Any business or organization that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a brief narrative response (5-10 pages, single-spaced), indicating previous experience and capabilities related to the described work. Capability Statements should describe (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information (f) any other resources available to support this project.</p>
<p>Responses to this Sources Sought Notice are due by February 10, 2010, 4:30 PM local time.</p>
<p>Responses can be sent by mail, fax, or E-mail to: <br />Sara M. McLaurin<br />Contract Specialist, NIH/NIMH<br />6001 Executive Blvd, Room 8154 (MSC 9661)<br />Rockville, Maryland 20892<br />Fax: 301-443-0501<br />E-mail: mclaurinsm@nida.nih.gov</p>

Request for Proposal (RFP) #: SAQMMA-10 R0095 & R0096

Notice of Solicitation of Submissions for Contractor Pre-Qualification

NOTE new format for submissions

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is requesting submissions to pre-qualify firms for construction services for the partial renovation, new additions, Perimeter Security Upgrades to the existing U. S. Embassies in Niamey, Niger & Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The projects are described below.

1.  Project Description (Secret Facility and Personnel Security Clearances Required)

SAQMMA-10-R0095 Niamey, Niger:  The project will include new construction of a Warehouse/Shops Addition to GSO Annex (Building C) and a Secure Loading Dock facility; renovation and rehabilitation of the existing Chancery (Building A) constructed in 1966 and renovation and rehabilitation of the existing Building C constructed in 1986. Both of the existing buildings are two story reinforced concrete framed structures with partial basements. The infrastructure of both buildings has deteriorated badly and can no longer be maintained satisfactorily by routine maintenance and repair.  The mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems are antiquated and insufficient to support current needs.  In addition, neither building meets fire, security and life-safety codes or barrier-free accessibility standards. This project will repair or replace the electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems and will bring the buildings up to fire and life-safety code and into compliance with barrier-free accessibility standards.  Total Approx sq meters to be renovated:  Building A Renovation - 1,206 gross square meters; Building C Renovation - 1,775 gross square meters; Warehouse/Shops Addition - 2,500 gross square meters; Secure Loading Dock Facility  175 gross square meters.

Estimated construction cost $16  21 million.

SAQMMA-10-R0096 Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia: The project will include reconfiguration and upgrade of Chancery and Annex 1 interiors to maximize desk count and meet minimum fire/life safety requirements.  Constructed in 1989 by the Mongolian Government, the Chancery is a two-story (1,800 GSM) unreinforced masonry structure with hollow core precast floor/roof slabs and a concrete frame.  Connected to the chancery by a single story enclosed connecting hallway is Annex 1.  Annex 1 is (1,180 GSM) a pre-fabricated steel frame building with masonry infill walls and few windows and was originally designed as a combination warehouse and recreation building.  As the need for mission office space increased portions of the building have been converted to general work area office and storage space.  The Chancery and Annex 1 buildings, in their present condition, have maximized the usable desk space and are presently facing a shortage of office space resulting in cramped, inefficient workstations and limiting future mission growth.  The existing buildings also lack basic accessibility accommodations, accessible toileting facilities and vertical transportation (lifts/elevators).  The buildings are not equipped with a fire suppression system and do not have any form of centralized HVAC or air filtrations systems: they are heated by hot water supplied by a city operated centralized plant.  Task will include:
-  In fill a second floor level above the remaining warehouse space in Annex 1 to capture additional office floor space.
- Upgrade HVAC systems to add mechanical ventilation/air filtration in the Chancery and Annex 1.  
- Electrical and Telecommunication upgrades to the Chancery and Annex 1.  
- Construct a two level connector with an elevator between the Chancery and Annex 1 to facilitate building circulation, emergency egress and accessibility.
- Install a fire suppression sprinkle system with fire pumps and below grade water storage.

Total Approx sq meters to be renovated:  Chancery Renovation - 1,800 gross square meters; Annex 1 Renovation - 1,180 gross square meters; Connecting Link, new construction - 380 gross square meters

Estimated construction cost $15  20 million.

2.  Project Solicitation - The project solicitation will consist of two phases.

<a href="mailto:milton.washington@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>PEO STRI Project Manager for Constructive Simulation (ConSim), APM SE Core has a requirement to manage and facilitate a virtual training environment supporting mission focused unit training that approximates the changing contemporary operational environment.<BR><BR>Intent of this RFI:  It is the intent of this RFI to accomplish two things:<BR><BR>1)	Request capability statements from potential offerors to be utilized by PEO STRI as support in our continuous market research toward supporting upcoming SE Core requirements.  Capability statements will not be utilized for any purpose other than for market research only.<BR>2)	Invite potential offerors in for one-on-one sessions to assist us in determining the proper acquisition strategy to achieve our overall objectives under SE Core. <BR>3)	For those potential offerors that respond with capability statements by the due date as specified in this RFI, you will be invited to participate in the one-on-one strategy sessions.<BR> <BR>Acquisition Approach: The Government is developing an acquisition strategy for the SE Core.  We anticipate that the SE Core requirements will be fulfilled via delivery orders under a single source IDIQ contract in accordance with FAR Part 16.  The Government anticipates award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis. The Government anticipates a combination of Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF), Firm Fixed Price (FFP), and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type delivery orders.   Issues to be considered in the acquisition strategy for this effort include the following:<BR><BR>"	SE Core has high level requirements defined in a CDD, but details change based on operational need (i.e. specific databases to be built are changed upon Combat Developer direction).<BR><BR>"	SE Core cannot determine the precise quantities to be ordered under this competition because we are the CVE Manager for all system and non-system Virtual Training Devices.  Consumers of SE Core products include PM CATT Training Devices, other PEO STRI Customers (LVC-IA), and external customer funded efforts such as PEO Aviation.<BR><BR>"	The Government's belief (based on five years of experience operating under two STOC I delivery orders) is that the SE Core requirements are better satisfied under one contractual vehicle.  Examples are, Product Line configuration management for the entire Virtual Domain, cannot be split amongst contractors.  Database Center operation and database development will break if separated; the efficiencies are only realized under same vendor.<BR><BR>"	Interoperability is the primary purpose of SE Core and must be the responsibility of one contractor.  Cost increases as the Government is required to fund multiple contractors and then fund the integration amongst the separately developed products.<BR> <BR>Quantities: The Government requirements for SE Core are as follows:<BR><BR>1.	Common Virtual Environment (CVE) Management  The threshold requirement for SE Core Common Virtual Environment Management is to provide CVE architecture and technical configuration requirements management for system and non-system Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) participating in SE Core enabled collective and combined arms training events.   SE Core Common Virtual Environment Management includes Systems Engineering for the virtual domain, the management of the Master Entity List (MEL), and requirements decomposition for the virtual domain.  The objective requirement for SE Core CVE Management is to provide CVE architecture and technical system configuration requirements for system and non-system TADSS participating in SE Core enabled unified action collective and combined arms training events.   <BR>2.	Terrain Database Generation  The threshold requirement for SE Core Terrain Database Generation is to produce simulation ready (up to Secret level) Terrain Databases (TDBs) for operational training.  The production rate required is 4,066,667 sq km at low fidelity, 207,400 sq km at medium fidelity, 101,667 sq km at medium high fidelity, and 8,472 sq km (contiguous or non-contiguous) at high fidelity, per calendar month renderable by Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) Interoperable Training Environment (ITE) TADSS, virtual training TADSS, game technologies and C2 systems.   The objective requirement for SE Core Terrain Database Generation is to produce simulation ready (up to Top Secret level) TDBs, interoperable with the unified action TDB production capabilities for operational training, and military operations, at a total rate of 8,733,333 sq km at low fidelity, 445,400 sq km at medium fidelity, 218,333 sq km at medium high fidelity, and 18,194 sq km (contiguous or non-contiguous) at high fidelity, per month renderable by Joint Live, Virtual and Constructive (JLVC) Training Environment (TE) TADSS, virtual individual training TADSS, game technologies and C2 systems. The Master Terrain Database produces up to Top Secret level TDBs, interoperable with the unified action TDB production capabilities for mission planning, rehearsal, training and real world operations, at a total rate of 3,493,333 sq km at low fidelity, 178,160 sq km at medium fidelity, 87,333 sq km at medium high fidelity, and 7,277 sq km (contiguous or non-contiguous) at high fidelity, per 96 continuous hours (surge) renderable by JLVC TE TADSS, virtual individual training TADSS, game technologies and C2 systems.<BR>3.	Dynamic Environment  The threshold requirement for SE Core Dynamic Environment capabilities includes physics-based approximations of the natural and manmade environment, to include effects of munitions, entity actions, exercise controller actions, atmospheric conditions, localized weather effects, radio frequency modeling, and Chemical-Biological-Radiological-Nuclear-high yeild Explosive (CBRNE).  These approximations must be rendered in the visual representation as well as all other affected CVE attributes.  The objective requirement for SE Core Dynamic Environment capabilities includes incorporation of higher fidelity physics-based approximations of the natural and man-made environment, to include effects of munitions, entity actions, atmospheric conditions, radio frequency modeling, and CBRNE; interoperable and correlated with unified action and Army LVC TE dynamic synthetic natural environments.  <BR>4.	Visual Model Development  The threshold requirement for SE Core Visual Model Development includes the development of visual models and fielded sensor (e.g., Out the Window (OTW), Infrared (IR), night vision, and radar) software models for Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT), Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT), Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT), Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) 2000, gunnery and flight simulations needs. These models include vehicles, humans and feature models for geo-typical objects in terrain databases.  The visual models will be developed at different levels of fidelity and states (e.g., operational, damaged, destroyed) allowing an individual simulation to render the visual model at the appropriate view based on events and conditions in the simulation.  The objective requirement for SE Core Visual Model Development includes the development of visual models and fielded sensor (e.g., OTW, IR, night vision, and radar) software models for additional TADSS using SE Core components.  <BR>5.	Virtual Simulation Architecture  The threshold requirement for SE Core Virtual Simulation Architecture (VSA) includes the systems engineering and any required development of CVE simulation services and architecture standards facilitating interoperability and fair fight between system and non-system TADSS participating in SE Core enabled collective and combined arms training events. The objective requirement for SE Core VSA includes the systems engineering and any required development of simulation services and architecture standards enabling interoperability and fair fight between the CVE and the JLVC TE.   <BR>6.	Database Plug-in Development  The threshold requirement for SE Core Database plug-in development includes assisting programs in the development and maintenance of plug-ins for virtual system and non-system TADSS required to use SE Core components.  The objective requirement for SE Core Database plug-in development includes assisting all programs in the development and maintenance of plug-ins for LVC ITE, JLVC, and game technologies, required to use SE Core components.  <BR>7.	Source Data Acquisition  The threshold requirement for Source Data Acquisition is to acquire up to Secret level source data for Terrain Database Development at a total rate of 1,200,000 sq km at low fidelity, 90,000 sq km at medium fidelity, 45,000 sq km at medium high fidelity and 2,500 sq km (contiguous or non-contiguous) at high fidelity, within 60 calendar days of request, once each fiscal year.  Ensure collaboration with Army Geospatial Information Officer, for terrain data interoperability and reuse.  The objective requirement for Source Data Acquisition is to acquire up to Top Secret level source data for Terrain Database Development at a total rate of 1,200,000 sq km at low fidelity, 90,000 sq km at medium fidelity, 45,000 sq km at medium high fidelity and 2,500 sq km (contiguous or non-contiguous) at high fidelity, within 14 calendar days of request, once each fiscal year.  Ensure collaboration with Army Geospatial Information Officer, for terrain data interoperability and reuse.<BR>8.	After Action Review (AAR)  The threshold requirement for the SE Core AAR is to improve existing virtual trainer AAR capabilities with a system to facilitate a common AAR from multiple different simulations within the CVE.  The SE Core capability will support local or networked AARs.  The AAR will recall and replay events of a virtual training exercise and provides the capability for any virtual simulators AAR station to analyze performance levels based on inherent or imported statistical data.  This AAR capability will allow for the collection data needed to conduct the AAR from any of the simulations and render visual and audio files or information from the exercise(s).  Additionally, a Video Teleconference (VTC) capability is required to better facilitate joint or combined arms AARs between different locations.  The objective requirement for the SE Core AAR is to facilitate a common AAR within Army LVC events, the JLVC TE, and in unified action collective and combined arms training events.<BR>9.	Long Haul Networking  The threshold requirement for SE Core is to develop and maintain a long haul networking capability up to Secret level between virtual systems to support training in the CVE.  This capability must be interoperable with virtual simulations through local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN) and link to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The objective requirement is to develop and maintain a long haul multi-level secure networking up to Secret level between virtual systems and is interoperable with the LVC TE, JLVC TE and unified action through local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN) and link to the GIG.   <BR>10.	Mission Planning and Preview Visualization Capability  The requirement is to provide a mission planning and preview visualization capability for exercises and operational training that is interoperable with existing planning capabilities and with system and non-system TADDS.<BR>11.	Sound/Smell Representation  The requirement is to provide a common sound and smell capability representing key attributes (e.g., battlefield noises, battlefield smells, environmental odors, vehicle aircraft/aircraft emissions, vehicle movement, aircraft, direction of impacting artillery, small arms fire, munitions, voices) of the CVE.  The sound representation includes accurate propagation modeling (i.e., echoes, directional sound cues, and manned module interaction with the environment). <BR>12.	Exercise Preparation and Execution Management Capability  The threshold requirement is the development of an exercise preparation capability supporting end users needs through automated supply chain management of CVE components supporting multiple training events.  This capability will also enable Life Cycle Contractor Support (LCCS) personnel to prepare an exercise with digital and paper products, such as maps and overlays and the capability to conduct distributed pre-exercise checks and connect simulations.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct a 6.3 Research & Development program as described below.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  Introduction: The Army desires to transition its aviation fleet to Condition Based Maintenance (CBM), as directed by  the DoD Logistics Transformation Strategy at https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=32584 and the Army Aviation CBM+ Plan 20 November 2004 at http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/mpp/cbm+/Army/Aviation%20CBM+%20PLAN%2029%20NOV%2004v6.doc.  This BAA is responsive to the Armys plan to mature embedded diagnostics and prognostics. Current maintenance is reactive to faults, not proactive, resulting in an excessive logistics support burden and high O&S costs. The Army S&T goal to decrease O&S cost by reducing maintenance, which was derived from the Rotary Wing Vehicle Technology Development Approach and the Aviation S&T Strategic Planning Workshops, supports this transition to CBM.  Specific 2013 program metrics are 50% Reduction in Inspections/ Flight Hour, 12% Reduction in Maintenance Labor/ Flight Hour, 15% Increase in Component Mean Time between Removals, less than 5% False Removal Rates and 10 hr detection time before failure measured against a 2005 fielded aircraft baseline. An integrated set of technologies is required to provide aviation platforms the ability to accurately assess health and project failure of critical aircraft components, based on actual usage in operational environments.<BR>The Capabilities-Based Operations and Sustainment TechnologiesAviation (COST-A) program will develop and demonstrate an integrated set of diagnostic, prognostic and system health assessment technologies to support Army objectives and enable transition to a CBM based philosophy. Specific COST-A objectives are reduction of inspections and preventative maintenance, expansion of serviceability criteria, extension of life or time between overhaul, and prediction of failure with sufficient fidelity to allow scheduling of maintenance.  Many technical opportunities exist to enable implementing condition based maintenance; however there are several key technical challenges. High fault detection rates need to be achieved with minimal false alarms. A wide range of aircraft components and failure modes need to be monitored with limited sensor data and a minimal weight penalty. Accurate estimates of remaining useful life for components across varying usage and environment are required. This program will result in an integrated set of demonstrated technologies that can be transitioned to support CBM. For this program, transition is defined as implementation of the technologies, after successful completion of this program, into an Army rotary wing aircraft (CH-47, UH-60, AH-64, OH-58).  This COST-A BAA will be limited to 6.3 Advanced Technology Development. Efforts under this BAA will develop, mature and demonstrate the technologies required to provide useful prognostics and system health information to support maintenance and operational decisions. Through this effort, technologies are expected to be matured to a TRL 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment), as well as be on a path for transition. Demonstration testing shall be full scale and representative of the expected aircraft operating environment and be of sufficient scope to validate the capability, accuracy and robustness of the technologies.  Technical Description.  The Government is seeking an integrated COST-A solution that will reduce the future maintenance burden, reduce O&S costs, and enable implementation of CBM methodologies. Specifically, the Government desires an integrated set of technologies to allow: reduction of inspections and preventative maintenance; expansion of serviceability criteria; extension of life or time between overhaul; prediction of failure with sufficient fidelity to allow scheduling of maintenance. Open systems architecture and use of common data standards are required. Proposed technologies shall be demonstrated to validate the capability, accuracy and functionality of sensors, interfaces and algorithms. Integration into an on-board data collection, processing, and storage device shall be conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the technologies as a single solution. A methodology to demonstrate the proposed technologies as well as an integrated solution shall be defined. Offerors are required to address each of the six rotorcraft technology areas, listed below (Propulsion System, Drives System, Electrical System, Structural System, Rotors System and Vehicle Management System) as part of their proposed solution. The integration effort is required, as a minimum, to include technologies from each of the six rotorcraft technology areas and shall demonstrate the capabilities of the integrated solution.  Offerors should justify their proposed technology selections and approach by quantifying benefits relative to current maintenance actions/drivers and program metrics.  Offerors should consider aircraft integration and implementation feasibility as a part of their proposed solution, specifically with respect to weight and numbers of sensor systems.  As a means to minimize impact, Offerors are encouraged to take advantage of available aircraft data and / or other sensor data wherever feasible. Offerors shall describe a clear path for transition and quantifiable benefits relative to the 2013 metrics.Propulsion System Maintenance of turboshaft engines are cost drivers and have a large impact on the safety and reliability of the aircraft. Efforts in the propulsion area should demonstrate prognostic capabilities. Efforts should demonstrate the ability to determine the remaining useful life of engine mechanical components, accessories, controls, sensors and wiring, and provide feedback for mission planning and maintenance scheduling. The monitoring and prognosis of engine Line Replaceable Units (LRU) is desired while minimizing additional sensors. Improvements in torque measurement can reduce the variability of power predictions, enable accurate maintenance decisions and increase the fidelity of usage monitoring.Drives System Drive systems impact safety of flight and are rigorously maintained. Much effort has been put into detecting gear and bearing failures through vibration and numerous other techniques, however prognostics have not been addressed. Proposed tasks should extend the current work to demonstrate prognostic methods with improved accuracy. Measurement of usage by methods such as torque/moment monitoring of mast and tail drive components is needed to enable on-condition replacement. In addition, methods to reduce the requirement for costly seeded fault testing are desired to aid in technology transition. Electrical System. Electronics, electrical power components and the associated wiring impact both aircraft maintenance cost through false removals and troubleshooting time. Intermittent faults and signal degradation due to wiring are challenging maintenance problems. Prognosis of electronics and electrical components is difficult due to the large number of failure modes and the uncertainty of the failures. Efforts should focus on the prognostics for electronic/electrical line replaceable units and automated diagnosis and fault isolation of wiring.  Structural System.  Structural maintenance significantly impacts sustainment costs and operational availability of rotorcraft.  A considerable amount of work has already been done developing technologies that can detect damage (corrosion, fatigue, and impact) in airframe structures by monitoring the environment, loading, and structural behavior; however, these diagnostic technologies are currently independent of each other, require a significant amount of sensors, and have a limited prognostics capability.  The intent of this effort is to build upon the work already done and demonstrate an efficient, fused approach to quickly assess structural integrity and predict service life remaining so that operators can make informed, risk-based decisions on the operational status of their rotorcraft.  Included in this is: (1) the ability to safely reduce the manual inspection requirements of structural components, especially those that are maintenance intensive (difficult to access or that currently require frequent inspection); (2) the ability to effectively fuse aircraft past and future usage with health status to enable manageable, cost-efficient, scheduled maintenance and repairs; (3) the ability to understand the effect of flight restrictions, maintenance actions, and various repair options on the vehicles operational status as well as the risk of continued operation without repair.  Offerors should consider weight and number of sensors as part of their proposed solution.  Rotors System.  Blade maintenance is predominantly driven by impact damage (e.g. ballistic damage, delaminations, voids) and is also dependent on the location and severity of the damage. Efforts are currently ongoing to investigate improved Battle Damage Assessment and Repair (BDAR) methods and techniques in order to establish damage criteria and determine if a blade needs to be repaired, how and where (i.e. field or depot) it can be repaired, or if it can be repaired at all. Advanced Technology Development is needed to demonstrate the ability to actively detect, localize, and determine severity of blade damage. This capability can refine and complement the BDAR process, providing higher fidelity data for damage assessment and more appropriate repair methods. Rotors and their associated dynamic components operate in high-cycle and environmentally challenging conditions. Maintenance of the dynamic hub components (spherical bearings, bushings, pushrods, root end couplings, etc.) is driven by high-cycle fatigue, and many of these areas are difficult to access and inspect. There is a need to monitor and effectively diagnose the integrity of the rotor system, which includes tracking actual usage and providing ample data to support either the assignment of usage credits or a reduced inspection/diagnostics effort once damage has occurred. The Army also desires the capability to predict remaining useful life and/or time to maintenance action of the rotor system based upon diagnosed component level events/faults, actual usage, and operational environments. Offerors need to also consider the unique challenges in reliably transferring data and power across the rotating frame (rotating component to static airframe).  Additionally, the Army desires advanced technologies that enable automated onboard adjustment of rotor track-and-balance, since current procedures require a maintenance action and improper track-and-balance can lead to several problems (e.g., increased vibration, decreased fatigue life).  Vehicle Management System.  Vehicle Management System (VMS) components (flight controls, pumps, bell cranks, bearings, electronics, actuators, etc.) require frequent inspections which are labor intensive, and often result in low fidelity diagnosis.  Advanced technology development is needed to improve the diagnostic and prognostic capability and reduce the frequency and complexity of inspections, thereby reducing maintenance labor hours associated with VMS components. Also, a total aircraft VMS approach is desired, in which information from other systems is used to improve vehicle state awareness and enable effective diagnostic and prognostic capability for VMS components.  This comprehensive understanding of the aircrafts health status also offers the potential to improve the diagnostic/prognostic fidelity for the other systems, as well as reduce component false removal rates and increase mean time between removals.  The intent of this effort is to (1) develop technology to reduce maintenance labor hours by reducing the frequency and complexity of inspections associated with VMS components; (2) define the property requirements (e.g. data rates, resolution, accuracy, etc.) to allow data use, independent of the source, to enable a VMS architecture; and (3) develop algorithms that use the available information to diagnose and prognosticate the health of the VMS components and other aircraft systems. Integration.  The integration effort shall encompass each of the six technology areas (Propulsion System, Drives System, Electrical System, Structural System, Rotors System and Vehicle Management System) and should include all of the technologies developed / demonstrated under this program. A system level analysis should be conducted to minimize impact to the aircraft.  This includes, as a minimum, overall system weight, number of sensors /systems, installation cost, maintenance cost, and effect on performance. As a means to minimize impact, reduce false alarms, and increase overall effectiveness, offerors are encouraged to take advantage of multiple system (technology area) sensors and logic wherever feasible.  An integration process should be defined that uses an open system architecture and data standards. This process should allow the use of third party software while protecting proprietary processes or algorithms. Hardware, software and interface requirements should be defined and documented early in the effort. This should include allocation of hardware resources such as processing, memory and interface bandwidth to the developed technologies. An integration demonstration shall be conducted that demonstrates the developed technologies functioning as an integrated system and providing meaningful status information to the user. ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  Available Government funding is approximately $15 million distributed by Government fiscal year as follows: FY10/FY11-4.0M, FY12-5.0M, FY13-5.0M, FY14-1.0M.  Multiple awards encompassing all of the technology areas under this BAA are not anticipated.  Expected award date is 4th quarter FY10Anticipated Period of Performance Not to exceed 40 Months Total (37 technical and 3 for Data/Final Report).  Any award made under this announcement is subject to the availability of funds.  Type of Funding Instrument.  A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy.    Such instruments include conventional contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented, and Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371), which are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  Under TIA's or OT(s) it is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half of the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321006r34p.pdf. Contract type is a subject for negotiation, but the Offerors desire should be clearly stated in the cost proposal.   Proposal Evaluation.  The selection for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement. Each proposal will receive an adjectival rating supported by narrative.  The adjectival ratings and supporting narrative will be considered along with other factors including the extent of restrictions placed on technical data deliverables that limit the Governments ability to further exploit the results of the research and cost to the Government.  The Government will develop an order of merit listing.  Proposed cost/cost to the Government will be evaluated, as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness.  Any proposed cost share will be evaluated for its benefit in reducing program risk, achieving program objectives, and furthering the state-of-the-art.  Any percentage of cost sharing proposed could result in greater evaluation credit.  Evaluation Criteria.   The selection for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. The criteria below are all of equal value. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement. These evaluations will result in narrative ratings, which will be used to develop an order of merit listing for proposals submitted. The evaluation criteria are: (1) The extent to which affordable, comprehensive, efficient, and innovative technologies are proposed within each of the six technology areas and the integrated solution to satisfy the COSTA BAA objectives. This will include understanding of the problem, current technical barriers, and how the proposed technologies and integrated solution eliminates those barriers. (2) The merit of the Offerors proposed approach to develop and demonstrate the proposed technologies within each of the technology areas and the integrated solution.  This includes the reasonableness of the proposed tasks, schedule, and approach to accomplish the scientific and technical objectives. (3) The benefit of the proposed integrated solution toward meeting the 2013 program metrics and enabling transition to an Army rotary wing aircraft. This includes a clear and reasonable path to transition the technology, the efficiency and feasibility (weight, number of sensors /systems, etc.) of the proposed technologies and integrated solution, as well as the quantitative analysis of benefits. (4) The capability of the Offeror to accomplish the proposed effort.  This includes the experience and qualifications of the proposed personnel, the suitability of the proposed facilities, and the availability of (or the ability to generate) required technical and test data to validate the integrated solution. The plan to award any subcontracts in a timely manner and effectively manage those subcontracts will also be considered. (5) The reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost to the Government. The proposed cost will be analyzed to determine whether the proposed cost elements (man-hours, labor categories, materials, travel, and other costs) are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the Offeror's technical proposal. Any proposed cost share will be evaluated for its benefit in reducing program risk, achieving program objectives, and furthering the state-of-the-art. Security Requirements: Unclassified, subject to export controls. Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751 et. seq.) or Executive Order 12470.  Prior to award, the successful Offeror(s) will be required to provide an Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement certification number issued in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25.  This certification may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FBA Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI  49017-3084, Telephone 1-800-352-3572.   Participation in this program is limited to U.S. as Prime Contractors; however, Subcontractors may be foreign owned.  Preaward access to or submission of a classified proposals not authorized. Government Furnished Property and Data:  Any expected Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) shall be clearly identified in the proposal.   It is the offeror's responsibility to identify, coordinate, and furnish supporting documentation for use of any Government furnished equipment or property.   No government furnished data will be provided. Offerors must have access to or be capable of generating the data required to develop and validate the algorithms or systems proposed.  Other Special Requirements - Data Rights:  The Government desires, at a minimum, to obtain Government Purpose Rights as defined by the DFARS, to all technical data, deliverables, and computer software to be delivered, and no limitations on the use of delivered and/or residual hardware.   It is the Offeror's responsibility to clearly acknowledge or take exception to the Governments desire to Government Purpose Rights. Deliverable Items:  The program will require delivery of the following data items: (1) Program Management Plan, (2) Design Review Briefing Charts, (3) Bi-Monthly Progress, Cost and Technical Performance Reports, (4) Final Report, (5) Final Briefing at Ft.

(Note:  Each of these items shall be delivered in the Offerors format).Preparation  & Submission  Instructions.   The proposal shall consist of two volumes, a technical volume and a cost volume In presenting the proposal material, prospective Offerors are advised that the quality of the information is significantly more important than quantity.  Offerors should confine the submissions to essential matters providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequate basis for the Government to conduct its evaluation.  The Government reserves the right to select for award only a portion of an Offerors proposal or the total proposed effort.   AATD encourages and promotes teaming arrangements with research organizations to include academia, industry, and small businesses in order to achieve a mix of relevant expertise and capabilities for executing COSTA research and development efforts.  The volumes shall be separate and complete so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and concurrently with, evaluation of the other. In addition, technical and cost proposals are due on the same date. Offerors should realize that the clarity of the presentation is important in communicating their project ideas to reviewers, and that a concise and well formulated proposal is usually more effective in that respect than a voluminous proposal that lacks effective distillation of ideas. Technical Volume.  The technical volume of the proposal shall provide an analysis that justifies the selection of the technologies and the integrated system proposed, benefits of the proposed technologies relative to the 2013 metrics, and the ability to transition to an Army aircraft. Integration of the technologies and demonstration methods should be covered. The technical volume shall also include a clear statement of the program objectives and the specific approach to be pursued and supporting background experience. It shall contain a Statement of Work (SOW), program milestones, a biographical section describing key personnel, a description of the facilities and/or data sources to be employed in the effort, and a program management section. Program management should include the approach for timely award and management of any subcontracts proposed. Offerors should identify and substantiate the beginning and ending Technology Readiness Levels. The technical volume shall not exceed 90 pages (minimum 12-point font). The evaluators will read only up to the maximum number of content pages specified.  Page limitations are inclusive of any drawings, charts, etc., and exclusive of section dividers, table of contents, list of figures/tables, glossary of terms and cross-referencing indices (which are not considered content pages).  Pages shall be standard 8  x 11 inch paper and main body type shall be not less than a font size Times New Roman 12, not less than single spacing  with margins at least 1 inch (types smaller than Times New Roman 12 are permitted only for captions, sub/super-scripts and labeling of figures and graphs).   Cost Volume.  Within the Cost Proposal, offerors shall indicate the proposed funding instrument (e.g., FAR-based contract and type (cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost reimbursable, etc.) or TIA). For consistency, the offeror shall submit other than cost or pricing data in the format suggested by FAR 15.403-5(b)(1), or in contractors format containing the information outlined below, together with supporting breakdowns   The supporting schedules may include summary level estimating rationale used to generate the proposed costs.  Information such as historical cost information, judgment, analogy to other similar efforts, etc. are generally accepted methods of projecting labor expenditures.  Purchase order history, catalog prices, vendor quotations, firm negotiated values, engineering estimates, etc. are generally accepted methods of projecting material requirements.  Subcontractor proposals, if applicable, including pricing rate details, should be provided concurrent with the prime contractors submission. Offerors should clearly identify the proposed contract type and clearly identify the proposed intellectual property rights extended to the Government. Proposal validity period should be identified.  The cost proposal shall not contain overflow of information suited for the technical proposal.  The offeror shall assure any overlap of data, (such as man-hours) does not conflict between the cost and technical proposal.  In the case of any conflict between the two, information in the cost proposal will take precedence.    The Cost Proposal should include the following: <BR><BR>(1) Funding.  A funding profile by month by Government fiscal year task to compare to the Governments funding profile.   If proposing a cost share, display that share with the particular government funding and fiscal year.<BR><BR>(2)  Pricing breakdowns. The Cost breakdowns shall be presented in three formats;<BR><BR> 	a) Total Program Level. Present all costs by cost category (including applicable rates and factors) by year (calendar or contractor year used to develop proposed rates and factors).  <BR><BR>  	b) Task Level.

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from a firm that is certified to resell Peoplesoft software support. This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS. ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS.<BR><BR>

THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The Small Business size standard is based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 115112, Soil Preparation, Planting, and Cultivating, which is $7.0 million average annual income.  

SUMMARY:  The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, Texas, is seeking a Contractor to furnish all labor, equipment, materials, and incidentals required for tree planting and herbaceous weed control of approximately 66.5 acres consisting of two (2) sites for the NRCS Texas Wetland Reserve Program (WRP).   All work shall be done in accordance with the Statement of Work Forest Stand Improvement Texas  Bryan Zone, the tree/shrub establishment Statement of Work, the Tree Planting Plan, and the Herbaceous Weed Control for Hardwood Seedlings Bryan Zone Job Sheet  490B.  

BACKGROUND:  Restoration projects on these two (2) sites include the planting of hardwood seedlings and herbaceous weed control.  
 
SCOPE OF WORK:   
1.  Pre-Planting Conference:  A pre-planting conference will be held between the contractor, owner (or his agent) and the NRCS to discuss planting operation.  Planting and Herbaceous Weed Treatment will not begin before this the Pre-Planting Conference. 

2.  Tree Planting: Hardwood seedlings will be machine planted or hand planted on a 10 X 10 spacing (436 trees per acre) on approximately 66.5 acres.  The planting for the area, except for strips around water impoundments, will consist of one mix described in the Tree Planting Plan attachment to this solicitation. 

3.  Species:  Refer to the attached Tree Planting Specifications.  The contractor is responsible for the ordering of the seedlings, their delivery to the site, their care, and, if necessary, cold storage.  The species for 	most of the site are grouped as preferred and secondary.  At least four species will be planted.  Each referred species will make up no more than 30% of the total mix, and secondary species will make up no more than 10% of the mix.  In addition, a separate mix will be used for the strips planted around impoundments.  In these strips at least two species from the list in the Tree Planting Specification will be 	used.

Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.   Procedures in FAR 13.106 are applicable to this procurement.  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of price and past performance.
The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.  Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed.  The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote.  The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>I. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as an invitation to Request for Quotations (RFQ) incorporates provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38. This is total small business set-aside procurement. The Small Business size standard is 1,000 employees. The NAICS is 336611. The contract will be awarded in accordance with provisions of FAR 13.5. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protestor essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: Solicitation/Contract number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and Solicitation Closing Date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protestors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protestor's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protestor may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protest in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half Street, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593. Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Interested  contractors must submit the following with their quote.  Quotes, which do not contain this information, may be determined unacceptable, or may be judged as not representing the best overall value to the Government.
1.  Completed SF 1449, Addendum to Section B, or acceptable alternative.  Prices quoted will be evaluated for completeness, reasonableness, and realism.  Realism will be used to identify quotes which are unusually low and which therefore indicate a potential misunderstanding of the solicitations requirements, or which increase the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.
2.  Past Performance  Information which evidences the level of quality in which the Contractor has performed prior similar contracts.  Based on the quotes received, the Government may contact some, all, or none of the references provided.  A vendors level of past performance may be evaluated solely on the information provided by that vendor.  Therefore vendors are advised to submit no less than the following information for three similar (scope and work) contracts performed in the past three years:
a.	 Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offerors proposal and data obtained from other sources.  However, the burden of providing thorough, complete, and current past performance information as requested in this paragraph remains the offerors responsibility.  Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk rests with the offerors.<BR><BR>b.	The offeror shall ensure that the documentation required in support of Past Performance is supplied by the evaluating agency to the Contracting Officer.  It is the offerors responsibility to follow up with the evaluating customer to ascertain if the required information has been forwarded prior to the established closing date.  The Government will not seek out corrections to incomplete or insufficient information on behalf of offerors.  Unverifiable information will not be considered in the past performance assessment. NOTES:  No Past Performance Survey submittals (mailed, emailed, or faxed) will be accepted from the offeror being evaluated.  The offeror should verify completion and submittal of the forms with the agencies/companies to which they provided the questionnaire.

This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS. ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the SeeBeyond software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS.<BR><BR>

<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">Q. The use of a FFP type contract for such a broad statement of work, for a small business, is rather disturbing. I had heard that Morgan Franklin did an assessment, where they gathered detailed requirements for this new system and provided recommendations for future procurement. Using firm fixed price for such a broad statement of work makes it appear that the RFP is structured in manner where Morgan Franklin and their partner 8a are the only firms capable of responding. Is Morgan Franklin, given their prior role in the assessment, barred from partnering on this <a style="mso-comment-reference: UDoL_2; mso-comment-date: 20100115T1402"></a><a style="mso-comment-reference: EU_1; mso-comment-date: 20100111T1055"><span style="mso-comment-continuation: 2">engagement</span></a>?<br /><strong>A. We have changed the contract type (please see attachements).&nbsp; Morgan Franklin did some assessments of the current system about 4 years ago. They will not be barred from submitting a proposal, assuming that they are an 8(a) qualified company.</strong></span></p>

The OFCCP's mission includes the investigation of a wide range of government contractors for EEO rules violations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Having an offerer develop and subsequently maintain a system that could be used to investigate EEO violations of that very same offerer presents a variety of conflict of interest issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Will the government look negatively on teams that contains firms that:</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">(a) have been or are currently being invested by the OFCCP, or<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">(b) are likely to come under the scrutiny of the OFCCP because of their size, variety of government contracts awarded etc?<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: navy"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">A. &nbsp;</span>No.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither issue will have any impact on the assessment of the solicitation which a company submits.<br /><br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">Q.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Q. </span>We believe that the requirement for an 8(a) to have both CMMI-3 certification and 3 years of case management experience is very limiting.&nbsp; We recommend that the 3 year criteria be changed to evaluate the quality of the offeror's case management&nbsp;experience and capabilities, rather than the duration.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: navy">A. The Vendor does not need to be CMM Level 3 certified at time of contract award, but it is anticipated that this certification will be acquired prior to delivery and implementation of the final deliverable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also anticipated that the final deliverable will be CMMI Level 3 compliant<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><br />Q. In order to respond as a prime, do you have to be certified at CMMI Level II or higher?&nbsp; If so, do you have to be certified at the time of submission?</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: navy">A.

<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri">Q. Is it possible to remove/relax &nbsp;the three year experience &nbsp;on Case Management Systems as a prime? We believe this will give the government a larger pool of vendors to choose from. Given that case management systems are usually large multi-year procurements, the pool of 8(a) companies that can respond with that qual may be limited.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: navy">A. Since the major Deliverable of this RFP is a Case Management System that is both efficient and cost-effective to the federal government, this requirement is essential to ensure that the federal government obtains the best resources/services to achieve the ultimate goal of this RFP. However, a combined 3 years experience as Prime&nbsp;AND/OR Sub will be accepted.</span></p>

<p>Q. Will the DOL consider preparing a separate RFP for building a custom statistics package to interface with the new case management system to conduct the statistical analyses required for the desk audits?<br /><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: navy">A. The OFCCP does not plan to prepare and release a separate RFP to provide this functionality, in support of this new IT Investment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is recommended that the Vendor Community provide solutions for this functionality as a component of their solicitation submission.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">Q.

<p><span style="COLOR: black">Q.

Yes, this combination of experience will satisfy the requirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We formed a team for this opportunity with one other company with the&nbsp;knowledge that case management capabilities were required.&nbsp; Both companies have case management experience, but neither company has 3 years experience as specified in the RFP.&nbsp; If the prime has between one and two years experience, and the subcontractor has performed case management work at multiple agences to set-up, customize, test, and deploy a re-engineered GFE case management system (the aggregate of the subcontractors work is also less than 3 years), can we still be considered a viable bidder for this work?<br /></span><span style="COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">A. Yes, this combination of experience will satisfy the requirement.</span></p>
<p>Q. Task 2 states "the offeror shall have at least three years of experience as a prime contractor in developing a case management system of similar complexity and scope."&nbsp; While we don't have 3 years developing a case management system as a prime contractor, we have developed a case management system as a commercial product.&nbsp; We also have experience as a prime contractor.&nbsp; Does that combination of circumstances fulfill the requirement?<br /><span style="COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">A.

<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">Q. Is there any possibility the government will consider having Task 1 and Task 2 be fixed price and the system development be Time and Materials?&nbsp; Fixed price development costs for a system whose requirements have not yet been defined creates a significant risk exposure if there is no room to adjust the bid (whether it be up or down) after the requirements are nailed down.<br />A. The CLIN structure has changed. Please review attachements.</p>

<p>4. POSITION TITLE: Program Manager (Multiple)</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: This position has been designated as a "tandem/ladder" position. The highest level of this position is a GS-12; however, USAID intends to fill this position at the GS-11 equivalent level. The entry level for this position has been established at the GS-11 level (Salary range: $62,467 - $81,204 per year). The actual salary of the successful candidate will be negotiated within the pay range of the GS-11 level depending on qualifications, previous relevant experience and work history, salary and educational background.

<p>The title of the position at the GS-11 level will be "Program Manager". Following one (1) year at the GS-11 equivalent grade the candidate will have the opportunity for advancement to a GS-12 equivalent grade. To be eligible for promotion to the GS-12 level, the incumbent must meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-12 grade, and receive an "Excellent" performance rating in the annual performance evaluation. The evaluation must include a statement by the supervisor that the employee is performing successfully at the current grade and is considered ready to perform at the higher grade level. Neither advancement nor extension of the contract is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Applicants must review their experience/education against the required minimum qualifications for the GS-11 positions carefully. No applications will be accepted for the GS-12 level.</p>
<p><br />6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 2 years, renewable up to 5 years</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, DC</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Program Manager is a member of one of DCHA/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has three regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Asia and Middle East (AME), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>NOTE: At least one candidate may be chosen to begin work on the LAC team. This candidate selected for initial work on the LAC regional team must meet the Spanish language requirement listed in the Selection Factors in this solicitation.</p>
<p>The Program Manager's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of time on strategic planning and program development.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to hire qualified personnel needed to assist and support OTI's regional teams with program implementation-related activities.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Regional Team Leader or his/her designee (e.g. the Sr. Program Manager), the Program Manager will:</p>
<p>At the GS-11 level "Program Manager":</p>
<p>&bull; Respond to requests for information and taskers regarding OTI programs from within and outside the Agency in collaboration with OTI's Program Office;</p>
<p>&bull; Implement and manage assigned country program(s), including contractors and grantees working under country programs and provide support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field, being prepared to travel to difficult posts in overseas conflict or post-conflict areas for up to one month or more if required;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide backstopping and troubleshooting support to field-based staff through frequent communication;</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as COTR (Contracting Officer Technical Representative) for Task Orders with a contractor for Program Office services, ensuring OTI's requirements are met (serving as COTR requires the successful completion of a USAID training course within the first 6-12 months of employment);</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure completion of OTI project administration, budgeting and contracting action needs;</p>
<p>&bull; Manage and/or participate in the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and personal services contractors;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop, monitor, evaluate and recommend performance measures for country programs and individual projects, including the work of contractors and grantees;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions, the Department of State, other USG agencies and departments, NGOs, international donors, and others interested in particular OTI country programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries;</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in design and implementation of new country program operations to include management, logistical, budget, administrative, personnel and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, participate on inter-office, inter-bureau, or inter-agency committees where issues relate to OTI's program goals;</p>
<p>&bull; In limited circumstances, the incumbent may be required to provide assistance to organizations outside of OTI but within the current scope of work, where such assistance would enhance both OTI's goals and objectives as well as the incumbent's job skills;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting team leader or country or deputy country representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor/train other OTI Program Assistants / Program Managers as required; and,</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs.</p>
<p>At the GS-12 level:</p>
<p>Perform the same duties as the GS-11 level but with less supervision, greater decision-making authority, and greater independence of action.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Program Manager will take direction from and will report to their respective OTI Regional Team Leader within the Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on assessment teams, Country Start-Ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Assessments, Country Start-ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees.

Update: ASC 647 AESS ATP-SE IDIQ TASK ORDER CONTRACT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this update is to reiterate to industry that information about the pending source selection, requirements for ATP-SE, or any other discussions pertaining to the ATP-SE that may occur with industry shall not be considered a requirement or direction unless that information has originated from the PCO, Mr. Robert Hixenbaugh. The ATP-SE team has been made aware of communication between the user and a contractor that may have related perceived requirements specifically "non-developmental ATP-SE system procured as a result of this sources sought synopsis will require a single OFP" This is not a currently planned requirement.  All future requirements for ATP-SE will be released to all potential Offerors through the PCO. If any Offeror believes they have received direction or guidance on the upcoming program it is incumbent upon them to disregard that information/not act upon that information if it has not come from the PCO. This announcement does not relieve the potential offerors from the previous request for submitting the capabilities statements on or before the 16 May deadline.This is not a request for proposal and no response is required.    The PCO shall be the sole POC for any and all communication regarding this acquisition: Kimberly Henderson, (937) 255-7682, email kimberly.henderson@wpafb.af.mil.

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from a firm that is certified to resell Peoplesoft software support. This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS. ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled NASA Notice of Intent to ReleaseSummer of Innovation Pilot Cooperative Agreement Notice NNH10ZNE004C which was posted onJanuary 10, 2010.The due date for responses is not extended.Description===========Under the authority of 42 United States Code 2486e(a), and as implemented at 14 Code ofFederal Regulations (C.F.R.) Part 1259, Subpart 3 (1259.300 through 1259.303), NASAAdministrator Charles F. Bolden has identified improvement of science, technology,engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning as a national need. With respect to this national need and in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2486e(a)and 14C.F.R. 1259.300, NASA plans to release a Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) entitledSummer of Innovation Pilot to consortia of the National Space Grant College andFellowship Program (Space Grant consortia) and to award up to five (5) cooperativeagreements.  With its demonstrated success, well established state-based network andstrong STEM workforce development, education and research mission, the Space Grantconsortia are uniquely qualified to implement the Summer of Innovation pilot within theextreme time constraints required for success.Under 42 U.S.C. 2486e(b), any award made under this section shall be subject to terms,conditions, and requirements as the Administrator considers necessary or appropriate. Accordingly, NASA has determined that submitters for this opportunity must be the LeadInstitution of the Space Grant consortium. There may only be one proposal per state. NASAintends to competitively select up to five (5) states to pilot the Summer of Innovationpilot during 2010.Proposers are encouraged to solicit the involvement, participation, and/or contributionsof interested public/private partners including NASA Centers, other federal agencies,non-profit and for-profit entities, and organizations/associations with relevantexperience and ability to accomplish the goals of the Summer of Innovation pilot. Partners included in a submitters proposal shall not be limited to current members ofthe Space Grant consortium for the particular state.Due to the nature and timing of the work to be performed, the following summaryinformation is being provided to allow proposers to begin formulating ideas andidentifying partners critical to the successful implementation of the Summer ofInnovation.  Purpose===========During the launch of the Educate to Innovate Campaign in November 2009, President Obamacalled for the expansion of science, technology, engineering and mathematicsopportunities for all young people.  NASA is launching Summer of Innovation pilot toincrease the scope and scale of the Agencys commitment to answer the Presidents call. Summer of Innovation is designed to improve STEM teaching and learning in partnershipwith federal agencies, universities, industry, museums, nonprofitorganizations/associations, and states and localities.	Summer of Innovation supports the Nations STEM priorities including the Educate toInnovate Campaign, Race to the Top, and the Investing in Innovation Fund (i3).	NASAencourages proposers to focus on: public/private partnerships to build rigorous STEMpathways; work with STEM partners to advance STEM instruction and application in theclassroom, and prepare more students particularly females and low-income and minoritypopulations  to enter STEM professions. As a pilot project within the NASA EducationPortfolio, the Summer of Innovation will contribute to the Agencys education goals.Overview===========The NASA Summer of Innovation is an intensive summer learning program that will launchand culminate in a national event. The objectives of the Summer of Innovation will beaccomplished by the strategic infusion of NASA content and products into evidence-basedsummer learning programs at the state level. Additionally, the program will involvedesign competitions and flagship events open to students and teachers nationwide.  NASAwill use the Summer of Innovation as a catalyst to expand, align, and strengthen existingstate-based STEM learning networks. It is anticipated that an enhanced state-basednetwork will result in increased access to NASA-unique, hands-on experiences available tomiddle school educators and students. The Summer of Innovation pilot will leverage the excitement of NASAs mission and provideintensive complementary STEM learning support during the summer months that engagesmiddle school students and teachers.  A significant outcome of the program is to expandthe pool of students, particularly females and those from low-income and underservedpopulations, to consider and pursue STEM professions.

The Government will conduct a price/cost evaluation of each offeror's proposal to determine whether or not each proposal complies with the stated criteria: "Reasonableness" and Realism". In determining overall cost to the Government for evaluation and selection purposes, the price proposed by an offeror who provides benefits/betterments within the stipulated price limitation may be afforded greater consideration than on offeror who proposes a lower price for basic requirements. </span></p>

For the price to be reasonable, it must represent a price that provides value to the Government when consideration is given to prices in the market, technical and functional capabilities of the offeror. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Realism</span> is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For price to be realistic, it must reflect what it would cost the offeror to perform the effort if the offeror operates with reasonable economy and efficiency. </span></p>

Proposals unrealistically high or low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between proposed performance and price must be clearly explained in the price proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, if unique and innovative approaches or conditions are the basis for an unbalanced/inconsistently priced proposal, the nature of these approaches and their impact on price must be completely documented.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The burden of proof of price realism rests solely with the offeror.</span></p>

<RESPDATE>030210
<CONTACT>Cara Calimano, Email cc436e@nih.gov
<DESC>This project is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the act.
<p>Modification 1 is hereby issued to add the word RECOVERY to the title description. ALL OTHER INFORMATION REMAINS UNCHANGED.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Information (RFI) and a separate written solicitation WILL be issued. The solicitation number is RFI No. NLM-10-057-CYC. This acquisition is not a small business set-aside and the NAICS Code is 541990.<br />In a national effort to promote patient safety, NLM proposes to create an authoritative, comprehensive, public digital image inventory of the nation's commercial prescription solid dose medications. Our current effort is a continuation and extension of our previous project providing the Veterans Administration with a complete digital photographic catalog of the VA Centralized Mail Order Pharmacy formulary for prescription tablets and capsules.<br />We intend to create a collection of digital photographs of prescription tablets and capsules, acquiring the images through a Simplified Acquisition Procedure. This will be an award to a contractor or vendor who will be responsible for acquiring the sample medications, creating high resolution digital photographs of the front (obverse) and back (reverse) surfaces of the samples using conventional techniques for color management, confirming that the images match the description of the medication, developing and matching the images of the samples to relevant metadata (including size descriptions, dimensions, color, and the provenance of the sample), and transmitting those data (images and metadata) to the National Library of Medicine. We believe that there are between 5,000 and 32,000 prescription solid-dose oral medications to be cataloged through this process.<br />The resulting digital image collection from this effort will be placed by NLM in the public domain. The impact of this collection will target patient safety including assisting in drug identification for poison control hotlines as well as online services for the public and nursing care professionals to confirm the identification of a drug to help prevent mistakes in medication. Other uses of the image collection include education and applications in pharmacy pedagogy such as its inclusion in textbooks and digital teaching materials. These applications demand high resolution, high quality images with good color reproduction to faithfully represent the medications through imagery. Smaller images and subsets of the collection can be generated from the original high-resolution data for other applications that do not require the same level of fidelity; however, we are committed to acquiring the best data possible through this mechanism.<br />NLM intends to identify a contractor or assemble a contractor-and-subcontractor team to address these issues, with the emphasis on experienced digital macro-photography talent as well as credentials and experience necessary to safely handle oral solid-dose prescription medications. The matching of the images to the correct identification of the medications is at least as critical as the dispensing of the medications to patients for treatment in that the impact of a mis-identification could have grave consequences. The need for quality control and verification in this project is likely to be significantly higher since the distribution of the resulting data could have widespread public impact, both a positive one if the collection is comprehensive and detailed, and significant negative impacts if there are errors in the database. The contractor should have clear explicit procedures for verifying the data and its correct correspondence to the medications from which it was derived. NLM expects the final team to incorporate photographers, assistants familiar with the handling of pharmaceuticals, a pharmacist for the appropriate qualifications in receiving, handling, and disposing of prescription medications, administrative technicians for the verification and electronic delivery of the digital images and their associated data, and information technology support for image processing, the extraction metadata, and technical support of the digital camera, its software, data storage and backup, as well as internet support to enable the electronic delivery of the digital data.<br />A possible by product of this first award would be a test data collection for the advancement of automatic pharmaceutical identification through computer vision from photographic data. NLM expects to promote computer vision research applied to the domain of content-based information retrieval (CBIR) of solid-dose pharmaceuticals, and anticipates the need for generating a test environment, including variations of photographs of the same drug or sample under different environments. We invite ideas and plans for the structure for such a test collection subset of the overall imaging effort including a discussion of issues such as: (1) the number of validated sample images needed to evaluate automated drug identification algorithms, (2) the different photographic conditions and equipment necessary to effectively support a test image collection, and (3) a plan for deploying and maintaining such a collection in support of a grand challenge or other mechanism for promoting computer vision for solid-dose pharmaceutical identification. This side project would be part of the technical evaluation for the entire award, but would be exercised as a possible option to the primary project.<br />We anticipate that this first award will encompass the acquisition, photography, and the electronic delivery of the resulting digital data of between 4,500 and 6,000 prescription medications. Proposals addressing this requirement should not surpass 1 year in duration. Up to four (4) options for additional services (the additional acquisition of images of pharmaceutical samples in lots of 6,000 samples) should be provided by teams responding to this requirement.<br />A supplemental project may be awarded as an option to create a test data collection from the digital images that are correctly identified to promote computer vision algorithms for the automatic and rapid identification of solid-dose pharmaceuticals. The images in the test data collection will likely include digital photographs of the solid-dose pharmaceutical samples under a variety of lighting conditions and across a diversity of equipment but correctly identified and correlated with the same samples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The review and award process will follow a two-step process:<br />A Request for Information (RFI) - Search for Sources will be conducted: Any offeror or group wishing to participate in the competition process MUST reply to the search for sources. Potential sources for this work will be asked for examples of their previous work and statements of their capabilities to meet the challenges posed by this project. If a substantial number of contractors respond to this RFI, NLM may use a Technical Evaluation Group (TEG) to evaluate the potential sources on their existing facilities, technical approach, capabilities for the acquisition and disposal of samples, expertise of available personnel, consultants, and subcontractors (including photographers, computer scientists, image processors, pharmacists, and technicians), and past performance. NIH personnel reserve the right to visit potential sites as part of the search for sources; however, a site visit is not required for a future award.<br />A Request for Quotes (RFQ) will be issued for a photographic collection. Only sources identified as competitive through the search for sources will be solicited for quotes for the competition. A complete Special Emphasis Panel (SEP) will be convened to make the award including any options to the contract or purchase order. These/this award(s) will be executed quickly through a Simplified Acquisitions Mechanism under FAR Part 13.<br />Response to the Search for Sources:<br />NLM will review the responses to the search for sources based on an evaluation of the responder's capabilities to execute both the expected photographic collection as well as the optional creation of the computer vision test data set. Responses to the Request for Information (RFI) that constitutes the search for sources will evaluate:<br />Proposed methods for acquiring the data: The response will be evaluated based on the overall technique. A complete proposal is not required, but rather an overview of the proposed method. How does the potential contractor plan to acquire sample medications? How will the contractor ensure that all images are properly identified with the correct medication? How will they process the image data for color management, size accuracy, and background removal?<br />Qualifications of existing personnel: The response will be evaluated based on the technical merits of the named existing personnel. Do they have experience in digital photography? Do they have expertise in managing digital images for record photography, curatorship, or some other related enterprise?<br />Existing facilities: Since this award process is not intended to provide funds for new equipment acquisition, the responders should describe their current capabilities for acquiring the data for the proposed photographic collection. If modifications of any equipment is required, the responses should describe the extent of the modifications, what capabilities are possible using the current configurations, and what capabilities will be enabled by proposed changes to the equipment.<br />Past performance: The responses should provide sources for relevant references of past performance in data acquisition.<br />Samples of previous work: The responses should include photographic or digital illustrations and evidence of previous results. These results should demonstrate the capability of the responder to provide the proposed data with accurate identification of the contents of individual images.<br />Page Limit to responses to the RFI:<br />Responses to the RFI search for sources should be limited to 10 pages of textual information (with figures and tables). Additional illustrations, photographs and evidence of results (presented in photographs or digital information) must accompany the response. The total response should not exceed 15 pages (text plus pictures).<br />Due Date:<br />Responses to the search for sources RFI are due on March 2, 2010. Electronic copies of the RFI response are due by the application deadline. In addition to the official electronic submission, two printed copies of the Sources Sought response are required. These printed hard copies should be printed, 3-hole punched, and submitted in binders. NLM anticipates an official deadline for electronic submission by noon (12:00 PM), Tuesday March 2, 2010, with an official deadline for printed hard copy submission by close of business, Friday March 5, 2010. Electronic copies of submissions should be sent via e-mail to the Contracting Specialist, Cara Calimano, at calimac@mail.nlm.nih.gov. The submission may be split into multiple e-mails to accommodate e-mail servers. At the completion of the submission of responses to the Sources Sought RFI, even if only a single e-mail is transmitted, an additional confirmation text-only e-mail should be transmitted, communicating that a complete submission has been sent and detailing the contents of each file and how many separate e-mail files should be expected. Paper copies may be submitted in writing to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 6707 Democracy Blvd. Suite 105, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Cara Calimano, Contract Specialist.<br />Response to the RFQ:<br />NLM will solicit quotes from sources identified through the Sources Sought RFI. You must respond to the RFI to be considered for the award. If the Sources Sought RFI generates a large number of responses, NLM will use a Technical Evaluation Group to determine which offerors will be invited to respond to the RFQ.<br />Technical proposals should cover:<br />(i) Technical details for:<br />Sample Acquisition<br />NLM will prioritize the list of images of samples to be acquired, beginning with the most widely prescribed drugs as well as the those medications that pose a public threat either through abuse or as a poisoning hazard. NLM proposes the use of DailyMed as the source of the initial list of prescription medications (4,676 medications listed as of 10-June-2009)<br />If samples are offered by participating manufacturers or vendors, the contractor will accept these samples as available.<br />The contractor will be responsible for establishing a source of medications and ensuring that their supply chain remains viable through the life of this project.<br />The contractor will establish and maintain procedures that comply with all state and federal regulations for the management, handling, and disposal of prescription medications.<br />Photographic quality<br />The contractor will adhere to image quality guidelines established by the NLM pertaining to issues of: color management (ensuring that the images provided reflect the actual color of the medication), image resolution (Minimum of 6 MPixels for the field including the pharmaceutical sample), file formats, color background (18% grey color background), and fiducial marks for size, color, and white balance. NLM will provide a standard color reference for matching colors in the raw digital images.<br />Quality control and Data transfer<br />The contractor will develop quality control procedures with the NLM for the verification of acceptable images, matching the images with the correct metadata, and data transmission.<br />Images and metadata will be transferred to NLM, subject to verification.<br />Transition plan - project completion<br />After the data collection is firmly established and the period of performance nears its end, the contractor may be required to transfer the program another contractor. The plan should address a process for disclosing all documentation, file formats, database organization, and open-source software. This transition is essential for the long-term sustainability of the project.<br />(ii) Qualifications of key personnel to execute this project.<br />Background expertise - the extent to which the key personnel and the project team as a whole have access to the range of educational backgrounds in macrophotography, in particular in photography for documenting scientific or records of physical samples.<br />Experience - the extent to which the key personnel and the project team include significant experience and expertise in the production workflows for documentation photography.<br />(iii) The commitment and experience of the institution or offeror in building and releasing public data resources for patient safety in pharmaceutical information.<br />(iv) Proposed relevant facilities<br />Page Limit to Technical Proposals in response to the RFQ:<br />The Technical Proposal should include examples digital images of pharmaceutical samples, demonstrating the capabilities of the respondent. These images are not included in the 15-page limit. Beyond these digital images 15 pages of technical proposal, resumes of key investigators, reprints of relevant technical papers, and other supplemental materials can be provided outside of the page limit. Reviewers are instructed that the 15-page technical proposal and the representative digital images are required reading, and supplemental materials are available as part of the support documentation but not required.<br />NLM is specifically seeking contractors with the discipline necessary to conduct this project, adhering to high standards of quality and consistency necessary to acquire high quality reference images through digital macrophotography and to verify and validate that images of these solid-dose pharmaceuticals are accurately tied to their respective medications. Regular progress evaluations may be initiated, and frequent interaction with the NIH staff responsible for the imaging informatics and release of the data to the public domain is expected.<br />The deliverables for this proposed project are the photographs of the solid-dose pharmaceutical samples, the metadata and information for correctly identifying and correlating the images with their corresponding medications. The resulting images and the final data will be owned by the National Institutes of Health and distributed to the public.<br />The NIH reserves the right to include a site visit as part of the proposal evaluation.<br />The requirement for the photographic collection will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. NLM anticipates that the first award of the photographic collection (up to 6,000 samples) will be completed within one year and costs will not exceed $500,000 including the cost of acquiring and disposing of the sample medications. All quotes will be evaluated on technical merit, qualifications of the personnel (including photographers, computer scientists, image processors, pharmacists, and technicians), cost, and past performance on research and development projects.<br />Request for Quotations (RFQ) Number NLM 10-058/CYC covering the photographic collection will be available on or about March 15, 2010.

<DESC>Q5: Regarding RFP page 16, Key Personnel and Proper Mix of Personnel and page 97, currently, key personnel are defined as those that are "program, supervisory, quality control, and maintenance analysis personnel." The listed positions utilized for ALC, SFLC, and LTPIO do not include positions designated as "program", "supervisory", or "quality control." Given that offerors are required to provide resumes for key personnel, would the Government provide a specific list of those positions titles designated as key personnel? Given that the Technical Proposal is limited to 50 pages, and that offerors must present their technical approach, past performance, corporate experience, and management approach within this page limit, and that there are potentially more than 15 positions designated as "key personnel", may offerors be allowed to provide synopses or bios for key personnel within the 50 page limit, with complete resumes included in an Appendix to Volume I? This will allow offerors to provide the Government with sufficient detail regarding accomplishing the work requirements, as well as provide the Government with suitable information regarding key personnel.<br />A5: The current positions identified are those for performance of the actual work at all levels. Key positions identified are for maintenance analysis personnel and for those responsible for assuring the work is satisfactorily performed. Resumes for key personnel may be provided in addition to the 50-page limit.
<p>Q6: IT Security Plan, RFP I.9 HSAR 3052.204-70 Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources (Jun 2006) RFP page 49, (b) and (1) - "The Contractor shall provide, implement, and maintain an IT Security Plan....Within ["insert number of days"] days after contract award, the contractor shall submit for approval its IT Security Plan." The number of days is omitted. Within how many days after contract award shall the IT Security Plan be submitted?<br />A6: Since the successful firm will not be connecting to CG servers, this requirement is not needed. All users will be using CG computers.</p>
<p>Q7: Uniformity of Proposal Format, Written component RFP Pg. 97, ADDENDA L.5.2 Uniformity in Proposal Format, Written component - "Technical proposal shall be limited to 50 pages...Each page is one sheet 8 1/2 X 11...Times New Roman font with 12 point size...charts, tables, or graphs shall be in Times New Roman font with 12 point size...Multiple pages of foldouts shall count as an equivalent of 8 1/2 X 11" pages." Please clarify the statement "Multiple pages of foldouts shall count as an equivalent of 8 1/2 X 11" pages." Does this mean the proposal can include as many pages of foldouts as are considered necessary to meet the requirements? Does this mean one foldout page equals one 8 1/2 X 11" page? We would like to recommend that the requirement for charts, tables or graphs to be in 12 point size be changed to 10 point size. Using a 12 point in the graphics will make it more difficult to convey concepts given the page size and limit requirements. <br />A7: One foldout page equals one 8 &frac12;" x 11" page. Ten point font size is acceptable for charts, tables, and graphs; any smaller will not be considered.</p>

<DESC>VA-251-10-RQ-0074Questions and Answers25 January 2010Q. What is the average number of man hours per month you are currently     utilizing for this contract? (What is the approximate volume of man-hours for all the areas combined)It is impossible to forecast the number of hours that this contract will utilize.  The jobs are set up as needed according to demands of the Interior Design team and normally in a pre-arranged schedule.  Last year the moving service was engaged between 32 and 240 man/hours a week. The Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) tries to accumulate jobs such that each moving/installing personnel are utilized for at least a full 8 hour day.Q. Do you consider "furniture installer" to fall under the "material handler" classification? (#21050)  If not, what classification do you use for "furniture installer"?For Wage Determination they are paid under the same classification #21050 although they perform a different function as far as skillset.Q. What are you currently paying per hour for:InstallerLaborerDay use of truckPanel cleaning for each panelChair cleaning for each chairThe current (expiring) contract is currently priced at $39/hour for an installer, $37/hour for a laborer, $175/day for a truck, $75/day for a van, $22/each for panel cleaning and $17/each for chair cleaning.Q. How big is the job approximate length of time? Specific jobs vary in length according to the needs of the COTR.  Last year, the utilization ranged between 2 workers for 2 days a week and 4 to 6 workers every day of the week.Q. Is this a standby arrangement or a five days a week full time job?This contract is for moving and installing services to be performed on an as-needed basis, normally prearranged by the COTR.Q. Please describe our responsibilities in reupholstering and upholstery cleaning?Responsibilities are outlined in the Statement of Work, specifically part IV B.Q. Are site visits available?No.  The actual location of the work will vary according to the needs of the COTR.  The list of possible stations is outlined in the Statement of Work. Q. Is work going to be performed on one site at a time or multiple sites?It is possible that work will be required at multiple sites at the same time. The schedule will be determined by the COTR.Q. What is considered a uniform?At a minimum, workers should have a shirt with company name identifying them as contract personnel.  The exact uniform requirement is determined by standard commercial practices and the contractor. Q. Do you have a breakdown for quantity of moving, installing, cleaning, and reupholstering?No.  It depends on the requirements for that particular job. Q. Are the trucks to be quoted by the hour or day?All quotes for trucks should be determined by the day. Q. What does the grand total represent?The grand total is the aggregate of the base year and all the option years for 1 unit of labor, cleaning, installing or truck usage.  For example, if a bid was submitted based on $2/hour for an installer, a laborer, panel cleaning, chair cleaning and $2/day for truck usage, the price quoted for that year would be $10.  The grand total would be that year plus the prices for the 3 option years. Q. Is it a requirement that the contractor headquarters be within 150 miles of Ann Arbor, or is it possible to have a satellite office set up within that range?Yes, the contractor headquarters must be within 150 miles of Ann Arbor.

<DESC>Recovery Action: The Contractor will assist the DOE Oak Ridge Office in the award, administration and closeout of approximately 870 Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Assistance provided includes application review, data validation, data entry, award processing, award administration, and reporting. <br />Duns # 364230099
<p>Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award: The work will be performed under a time-and-materials contract. The work is within the scope of the contract which was awarded as an 8(a) competitive contract in accordance with FAR 19.8. The procurement was not awarded as a fixed-price contract because it was not possible at the time of award of the contract to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION.  FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DUNS 007113228.  The modification addresses the following work: 

The work is for Lighting Research and Development. The objective of the project is to investigate the effect of Gallium Nitride (GaN) orientation on the Internal Quantum Efficiency (IQE) and External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) of green Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs).

The action is other than fixed price because work is assigned to the contractor (Sandia Corporation) through the issuance of a Work Authorization pursuant to the terms and conditions of the prime management and operating contract, which was awarded as a cost reimbursement type contract due to technical and cost uncertainties in contract performance.  Costs cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract as the exact nature and duration of the work is uncertain.  Sandia was selected by DOE to participate in this American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) work due to the expertise at Sandia National Laboratories in the subject matter.  The work falls under prime contract statement of work paragraph 3.3 which states: The Contractor shall provide research, design and manufacturing capabilities for solar electric technologies (solar thermal and photovoltaic), wind energy, geothermal energy systems, industrial and transportation applications, fossil energy programs, electric power systems, hydrogen power technologies and battery systems for utilities and transportation.

NOTE:  This action is Modification no. A368 that recognizes Work Authorization No. BT-100003-20717-10 issued under M&O Contract number DE-AC04-94AL85000.  This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars.

<DESC>This action is necessitated to provide year round fire flow capacity for the M.W. Boudreaux Memorial Visitor Center currently under construction. It is necessary to modify the Ray Behrens Elevated Tank in order to overcome the low water usage typically experienced throughout the cooler months. During these cooler conditions, the water becomes stagnant, loses chlorine residual, and becomes susceptible to freezing, resulting in water unsafe for consumption, and ice build up potentially damaging to the tank.  To avoid theses circumstances the Water District removes the tank from service throughout the cooler months. In order to overcome the issue of low water usage with seasonal outages, t  he Ray Behrens Elevated Tank must be modified to provide year round flow capacity. Contract is for construction of a part of a utility system and the utility company itself is the only source capable to work on the system.
