This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participations has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractor but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitions.

A determination by the Government not to complete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
NOTE:   While price will be a significant refractor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price sole source contract to Smiths Detection, Edgewood, Maryland for the development and delivery of six (6) Toxic Industrial Chemical-Adapter (TIC-A)/Communication Adapter (CA) prototype interface devices under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The NAICS code for this requirement is 334511 with a size standard of 750.
<p>The requirement is to enhance the M4A1 Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) with TIC-A capabilities and output data in the M88 Automatic Chemical Agent Detector Alarm (ACADA) format. The device must be 100 percent compatible with ACADA data stream output.</p>
<p>Development of the CA and TIC-A interface requires technical knowledge of both the ACADA and JCAD systems. The Government does not possess a competitive Technical Data Package (TDP) for the M4A1 JCAD or the M88 ACADA that would allow for full and open competition of the TIC-A/CA interface prototype. Smiths Detection owns the TDP, is the sole manufacturer and has proprietary rights and is therefore is the only source capable of producing the prototype.</p>
<p>The total period of performance for this effort will be 6 months after contract award.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by ACC-APG</p>

<DESC>NASA has a requirement to extend the Safety and Mission Assurance Support Services (SMASS) contract NNJ06JE86C at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) for a period of five months, with one 1-month option. The SMASS contract began May 1, 2006 and is currently scheduled for completion on April 30, 2013. NASA intends to extend the period of performance through September 30, 2013. Exercise of the 1-month option would extend performance through October 31, 2013.  This extension to the SMASS contract is required to provide continued essential safety and mission assurance support services to NASA-JSC while the follow-on procurement is competed and awarded. The current SMASS contract provides the NASA-JSC Safety and Mission Assurance Directorate with support in the fields of safety, reliability, maintainability, quality engineering, and quality assurance and also provides essential skills and expertise in the subsystem disciplines of structures, mechanisms, environmental control and life support systems, guidance navigation and controls, and propulsion and thermal control systems.  NASA-JSC intends to purchase these services from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), the current contractor. The procurement will be supported by a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). SAIC has unique knowledge of all Programs that the S&MA Directorate supports and is able to provide continued services without unacceptable duplication of cost or delay in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  The current SMASS contract provides support to the International Space Station, Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), Extravehicular Project Office, and the Advanced Exploration Systems Office (AES). In addition, the SMASS contract provides support to the Receiving Inspection and Testing Facility (RITF) in the areas of mechanical, chemical, and electrical testing. The RITF specializes in fastener testing, wire/cable certification, and electronic component evaluation for JSC programs and projects. The SMASS contract also provides pressure systems technical expertise and manages the pressure systems certification program for both the NASA-JSC and NASA White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico and provides assurance engineering support to the development of all of JSCs government furnished equipment. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 1, 2012. Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact SAIC directly. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	      .

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ, intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Advanced Concepts and Technologies International (ACT I), 1105 Wooded Acres, Suite 500, Waco, TX 76710, a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract for Cost, Affordability and Technical Service Support for the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office (JSFPO) Arlington, VA. The Government intends to procure the above services under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, to ensure there will not be a break in the required services while a competitive Seaport-e Task Order is being put in place. The procurement will consist of a six-month base period and two three-month options.
<p>The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) F-35 program is a joint DoD ACAT 1D major acquisition program that includes the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U. S. Marine Corps. JSF F-35 also includes eight foreign partner countries formally identified as Cooperative Partner Participants (CPP) along with three other countries called Security Cooperative Participants (SCP). The F-35 JPO requires cost, affordability and technical support services to support its critical mission of developing the next generation strike fighter aircraft. The program cost, affordability, and technical support disciplines consist of Program Management, Cost Estimating, Earned Value Management, Scheduling and System Integration Support. These services support the development of cost models and provide analysis for cost, schedule and Autonomic Logistics and Global Sustainment (ALGS). The work to be performed under this contract will ensure that the JSF F-35's Cost and Earned Value Management (EVM) Integrated Product Team (IPT) has the technical expertise to procure an affordable next generation strike aircraft weapon system.<br /><br />The services of this procurement will support JSF F-35 locations in Arlington, VA and Wright Patterson Air Force Base, OH. <br /><br />ACT I is currently supplying the support services for this requirement. It is in the Government's best interest to issue a new contract to ACT I for a continuation of services while the competitive Seaport-e Task Order is being put in place. This will ensure there will not be a break in the services required; any interruption to these services would cause the JSF F-35 program to lose critical program data and information.</p>
<p>This sole source action is a temporary bridge for the continuation of services until the Seaport-e Task Order is in place. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received within fifteen (15) days of publication of this notice. Any responses should reverence N68335-13-R-0018. The Point of Contact is Suzanne Tilton, email suzanne.tilton@navy.mil.</p>

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to award a delivery order under the Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N61340-12-G-0001 to L-3 Communications Corporation, Link Simulation & Training Division (L-3) for the procurement of Configuration Management functions for F/A-18 C/D and FA/EA-18 Common Products, Information Assurance software patches for F/A-18 C/D and FA/EA-18 Common Products, FA/EA-18 Technical Documentation and associated databases, and FA/EA -18 spares.  This is a continuation of the Configuration Management, Technical Documentation, and Information Assurance efforts that were previously awarded to L-3; however it is expanded to include the FA/EA-18C-G Common Products.
 Award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling FA/EA-18 mission training requirements.  This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). This notice of intent is neither a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation of offers. Matters pertaining to this notification may be directed to Jana McEntegart at 407-380-4997 or via email at jana.mcentegart@navy.mil

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to utilize other than full and open competition to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract with Lockheed Martin Global Training and Logistics (GTL), 500 Woodlake Drive #2, Chesapeake VA 23320.  This contract action is required to ensure Product Supportability of Undersea Warfare (USW) Combat Systems including AN/SQQ-89 variants, LCS ASW MP and AN/SQQ-90, for both US and FMS customers.   This contract action is required to support integrated logistics development, Equipment Alteration and Installation, Fleet Support and Life-Cycle product supportability across USW programs.  The execution of these tasks will provide program risk mitigation and present a viable transition to the competitive follow-on procurement.
  This contract will have a 12-month base period and one 12-month option.  

Lockheed Martin GTL is the current Product Support provider for the USW systems.  NAVSEA intends to award a contract resulting from this synopsis on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as Lockheed Martin is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge and experience of the system to meet the Government's requirement within the time required.  This announcement is published for information purposes only.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Lockheed Martin directly.  

The AN/SQQ-89 program provides integrated USW Combat Systems Management, Fire Control, Command and Control, and On-Board Training to enable surface ships to engage USW targets.
  These state-of-the-art systems are comprised of integrated subsystems that provide USW search, detection, classification, localization and weapon prosecution for surface ships in both littoral and open ocean environments.   Current USW  systems provide major capability improvements through hardware and software upgrades using an Advanced Capability Build (ACB) process.  

Notice:  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.   All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
  However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Renita Tyus

<DESC>Sole Source Synopsis:
Subject Matter Expert to Develop Answers to CDC?s High Priority Questions on the Safety and Use of Water during an Anthrax-related Emergency
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC), Office Acquisition Management (OAM) Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases (DFWED), Waterborne Disease Prevention Branch (WDPB), has an urgent need to develop answers to previously posed questions about the safety and use of water during an anthrax related emergency.  In the event of an attack or viable threat to water systems, local water utilities, public health departments, and other officials will be required to answer questions and provide information to the media and public about potential risks and necessary actions.  Risk Communication research indicates that more than 95% of questions that will be raised during a crisis situation can be anticipated before an event occurs using a thorough and systematic approach. The CDC has determined that the EPA?s Office of Research and Development, National Homeland Security Research Center has the expertise needed to an ticipate potential questions and provide responses that can be communicated to the media and the general public in the event of an attack or viable threat. 
The Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC), has been tasked through an Interagency Agreement (IA) to plan, organize, and conduct a technical Subject Matter Expert (SME) workshop to develop answers to questions the CDC has identified as critical related to the safety, supply, and use of water after an international release of Bacillus anthracis spores ( anthrax), including an aerosol release.  The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor qualified to provide pertinent highly qualified national technical experts; a representative cross-section of water utility personnel representative of various US regions; local, state and federal agencies; emergency response organizations and public health agencies that will make up the SME wok group.  The workshop is anticipated to occur in early December in the Washington DC metropolitan area.  Therefore it is crucial that the contractor has the expertise to facilitate the worksho p and assemble participates in a timely manner.  
Experience from previous successful NHSRC and CDC collaborative efforts has proven that the American Water Works Association (AWWA) is uniquely qualified to provide the services for this project within the needed timeframe and has a unique ability to identify and engage qualified SMEs.  AWWA is the preeminent professional organization for the drinking water industry in the Unites States, with more than 50,000 individual and 4,700 utility members.  AWWA has worked to advance technology development, education, science, management, and policies for the drinking water sector.  The research wing of the organization, the Water Research Foundation (WRF), is the world?s largest research organization dedicated to drinking water research and it is well respected among researchers.  WRF has managed more than 1,000 high impact research studies.  This includes several pertinent risk communication studies such as; Protocol for Cryptosporidium Risk Communication (Project 444); Water Conserv ation: customer Behavior and Effective Communication (Project 4012); Customer Attitudes, Behavior, and the Impact of Communications Efforts (Project 2613); Advancing Collaborations for Water-Related Health Risk Communication (Project 2851); Risk Communication for Emerging Contaminants (Project 2776) and Workshops Focusing on Adaptation Strategies and Information Needs to Respond to Extreme Events (Project 4416). AWWA shall provide technical and logistical support to 1) identify and arrange for the participation of nationally recognized subject matter experts within a relatively short timeframe; 2) provide a highly qualified technical facilitator with knowledge of public health and the water sector; 3) conduct the workshop and report the results. This is not a request for proposal. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice. 
A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. The applicable NAICS code is 541620. Please submit your request in writing to: US EPA, Renita Tyus at 26 W. Martin Luther King Dr, Cincinnati, OH, 45268 or fax your request to (513) 487-2109, or email tyus.renita@epa.gov. No telephone request will be honored.

<CONTACT>Pamela E. Smith
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Research Triangle Park Procurement Operations Division [RTPPOD] intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Illumina, Inc., 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, CA 92122 for the acquisition of 20/each, Part#: BD-202-0202 MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression Beadchip Kit (16 samples). These beadchips are designed to be used with the existing Illumina HT Sequencing System that is located in the NHEERLGenomic Core (GRC) and cannot be utilized with any other existing fluorescent scanner because of the unique chip design.  Future experiments at NHEERL will generate data to be compared with existing Illumina data sets at the US EPA.  Consistency in platform comparison is critical to the genomic scientific mission at NHEERL. The research application of Illumina bead chip requires that the chips be scanned on the Illumina HiScan scanner. The image is displayed on a screen connected to the scanner and  analog software generates a density number for each gene, to be used in the analysis.   No other sources of supply exist on the market. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.302-1 "only one source reasonably available".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist.  The EPA has identified Illumina  Inc, as the only vendor capable of satisfying this requirement. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement no later than 10 days after the date of this publication. Timely responses will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions sho uld be directed to Pamela E. Smith via the e-mail smith.pamela@epa.gov; telephone calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SEEKS EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR LEASE OF WAREHOUSE AND RELATED SPACE
<p>The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.</p>
<p>The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement. In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Government's requirements. With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume a maximum rental rate above which would require an authorized lease prospectus in the event the respondent fails to include such information.<br /><br />Solicitation Number: 0MD2164 <br />State: Maryland<br />City: Beltsville<br />Must be located within the following Delineated Area: Point of Beginning is at the intersection of Route 32 and Route 29 aka Old Columbia Pike.

<DESC>The NASA/SSC Office of Procurement intends to issue a sole source, firm fixed price contract to the Hancock County Sheriffs Office (HCSO) to furnish the personnel, facilities, equipment and materials necessary to provide dedicated security in-depth patrol services of the buffer zone in order to assure a measure of protection of SSC and its supporting infrastructure.	The Contractor shall provide security patrols of the buffer zone to protect critical infrastructure and property (approximately 250 miles) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, above and beyond any normal routine patrols provided by the Sheriffs Department.  HCSO is the only known vendor that can provide these services, which include notification, coordination, and liaison with other local, state, or federal law enforcement agencies whose jurisdiction and/or support is necessary to carry out both routine and special law enforcement duties and making arrests if necessary.  There will be only one award made for this requirement and the period of performance will be approximately a nine (9) month base period and four (4) option years for a total period of performance of fifty-seven (57) months. This is a sole source commercial acquisition under the authority of FAR Parts 6.302-1 and 12.  The Government believes only one responsible source can provide the services to include arrest authority that will satisfy the Agency's requirements.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSAL (RFP).  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort, in writing, to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. (local time) on November 1, 2012.	Submissions will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This acquisition is unrestricted.  The NAICS Code is 922120 and has no size standard.  The DPAS Rating for this procurement is DO-9 (see 15 CFR 700).  FOB is destination.  It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued to HCSO on or about November 8, 2012 with their response due NLT 1:00 p.m. on December 8, 2012.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The current legacy ATM network successfully transports serial sensor bitstreams, non-serial imaging sensors bitstreams (both stills and full motion video), and imagery (full and motion), voice, avionics bitstreams, and data as received from reconnaissance aircraft aloft overseas to various AF DCGS sites, where processing takes place. Following successful processing, products are commonly sent over IP networks to consumers. The IP networks used to transport products to consumers is not being replaced.
<p>The goal is to allow the AF DCGS enterprise to take advantage of emerging high-speed deterministic technologies to meet the requirements of moving very large amounts non-processed bitstreams in real-time, with extremely low bit error rates, and with deterministic (fixed latency, precision-timed -latency) capabilities using a converged network topology.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis
<p>Title: Repair and/or overhaul of MMIII Missile Guidance System, Inertial Components, Electronics, Equipment, Shipping &amp; Storage Containers, Software, and demilitarization of deactivated, excess, and condemned government property, supply chain functions (stock, store, distribution &amp; transportation).</p>
<p>Synopsis: This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) announcement will be used solely for informational and planning purposes, pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). This notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP)/Request for Quote (RFQ) or Invitation for Bid (IFB). This SSS is a market research tool to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources which will be used to determine potential sources prior to issuance of any Request for Proposal/Quote or Bid. This information is not to be interpreted as a commitment by the Government. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary and responders are advised that the government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this SSS.</p>
<p>Accomplishment of this workload is to be performed at the Central Ohio Aerospace and Technology Center located in Heath, Ohio as a result of a previous Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decision to maximize privatization of this workload in place. Additionally, the lack of sufficient test/support equipment and an estimated two-year timeline to move workload prevents the transfer to another facility and would likely result in significant interruption to repair and compromise support to the missile wing. Serialized control, repair/Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM)/Maintenance and/or overhaul of the MMIII Missile Guidance System and its subassemblies, components, test/support equipment, including special tools and test equipment, unique shipping/storage containers, software and demilitarization are requirements. Replacement of unique, peculiar and one-of-a-kind Depot Support Equipment, modifications, and service life extensions will also be a requirement. Since reverse engineering is not authorized under repair, licensing or teaming agreements must be obtained from all Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) allowing the use of proprietary data and capital owned tooling, fixtures and intellectual property in performance of repair and replacements.</p>
<p>Based on the requirements, interested sources not already qualified to provide the requisite services may submit a concise and program specific Statement of Capability (SOC). The SOC should include the following:</p>
<p>1. Present sufficient information to substantiate that there is the necessary knowledge and understanding of the requirements and the MMIII weapon system. Detail experience in performing efforts of similar value, size, and scope within the last five years including contract number, indication of whether your company acted as a prime or subcontractor, level of repair experience (e.g., system level, sub-assembly, component, module, or mostly remove and replace with reliance on sub-contractors, or other), sub-contractors required to team with, contract value and appropriate management. Describe the qualifications of personnel projected to work on this effort. Production engineering and technical personnel should have experience with NS50 Missile Guidance System repair and be able to perform failure analysis and work with the necessary support contractors (OEMs) to ensure resolution. Touch labor employees should have the appropriate certifications with a ratio of journeymen sufficient to maintain a presence in key areas of repair to oversee repair activities and mentor/train lower tiered employees. At a minimum, experience with complex precision inertial components is necessary.</p>
<p>2. Describe ability to handle and dispose of low level radiation, hazardous material, explosives and other environmental sensitive material and ability to obtain the necessary state and/or local licenses. Identify current level of ISO/ANSI/CMMI accreditations.</p>
<p>3. Describe knowledge of azimuth astronomic measurements and reference information derived from star sightings as it relates to the existing facility and its line of site requirements, along with experience, knowledge of operation, troubleshooting and fix capability of this one-of-a-kind equipment required for this effort.</p>
<p>4. Describe the Air Force and Defense Logistics Agency data systems you currently access or your ability to gain access to those systems required for processing changes to technical data and supply chain requirements supporting repair. Describe approach to process specifications changes that are OEM controlled, repair models, unique tools, software source and executable code developed for instrument performance during test (beyond test/support equipment outputs).</p>
<p>5. Describe seamless approach, facility leasing arrangement, and timeline to turnkey/transition from the current contractor and taking into consideration facility integration of remaining OEM workloads that will likely remain on-site, while minimizing interference to ICBM repair and supplying adequate spares to the missile wing and ensuring preservation of continuous mission readiness. Further describe how you plan to minimize the fluctuation or increase of base rates for this effort in a multi-contractor facility.</p>
<p>6. Describe level of security clearances for facility, hardware, software, data and personnel and/or ability to obtain and maintain clearances up to Top Secret. Also describe how you plan to integrate the security requirements of this effort within a multi-contractor facility.</p>
<p>7. Describe support approach to "no notice" surge requirements and how you will address bottlenecks and capacity issues within the repair line and supply chain.</p>
<p>Information is provided for discussion purposes and any potential strategy for this acquisition may change prior to any solicitation release. The government requests that non-proprietary information be submitted in response to the SSS.</p>
<p>Written responses should be limited to no more than 15 pages, using Times New Roman, 12 point font, with a one-inch top, bottom, and edge margins. Tables, pictures, spreadsheets, etc are acceptable, but limited to no more than 5 pages. A combined package should not exceed a total of 20 pages.<br />&emsp;</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). Firms responding to this announcement should include company name, cage code, point of contact, address and indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUB Zone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business. The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.</p>
<p>SOCs may be submitted by facsimile at 801-777-0128; e-mail: kyle.chase@ hill.af.mil; or mailed to 6014 Dogwood Ave, Bldg 1258, rm 24, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5816, Attention: Kyle Chase. Responses must be received not later than close of business (COB) 4:00 pm MST, 16 November 2012. Identify your response with the corresponding Program Title: Sources Sought: Guidance repair.</p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command- Picatinny (ACC-Picatinny) on behalf of the Analysis & Evaluation Technology Division (AETD) within Munitions Engineering Technology Center (METC) is conducting market research to identify potential sources that are capable of providing electro-spun single crystalline tungsten trioxide nanowires.  The goal of the U.S. Army, Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) is to enhance the thermal stability of all hardware subjected to extreme temperatures and thermal cycles. Typical thermal requirements are -52C to 71C for storage and -41C to 62C for operations. AETDs current efforts are to identify enhanced thermal management mechanisms employing nanostructured tungsten trioxide as a potential candidate for a novel thermal barrier coating system. This study is limited to tungsten trioxide coating, which can be applied at nominal temperatures (i.e. room temperature).
Interested parties should include information that provides evidence of experience in the following areas in a white paper format: 1. Electro-spinning metal oxides using traditional electro-spinning, core-shell electro-spinning, and bowl-edge spinning techniques. 2.

<DESC>Market Survey - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS - This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at https://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane.

Description: Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division (NSWCCD) in Indiana is currently seeking sources for hazardous paint removal, surface preparation, and repainting of two Launch Test Vehicles (LTV).
 Each disassembled LTV main body is a 108,000 lb x 7 diameter x 33 long steel tube with confined space entry points. Additional removed components, ranging in weight from a few pounds to as much as 9,500 lbs, bring the total weight of each assembled LTV to 130,000 lbs. A bulk sample of the existing external paint found detectable levels of chromium, chromium VI, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, strontium, and zinc. The internal paint is assumed to be identical.  

The Government is looking for potential vendors who have experience in developing and executing cost effective, yet workable plans in accordance with all applicable safety and environmental regulations.  The potential vendor may recommend using alternate methods of hazardous paint removal other than sandblasting.
 The potential vendor may recommend transporting the LTVs and performing the work outside or at their own facility. 

The vendor and/or vendor facility shall have the following capabilities: confined space entry, hazardous paint removal (i.e. chemical peel, sandblasting, etc), disposal of hazardous waste, surface preparation (i.e. grinding, sanding, buffing, cleaning  including cleaning of tapped holes), surface roughness measurements, paint application, and film thickness measurements. The vendor and/or vendor facility may need the following capabilities: heavy lifting, heavy hauling, and fill welding gouges or knicks.   

Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) will include a pair of 480V, 12A Koike Aronson Turning Rolls, and two pair of custom made storage cradles.

Specifications: Reference drawings of the LTVs are available from the point of contact listed below.
 Surface preparation methods shall be in accordance with SSPC-SP 10 NACE No. 2, SSPC-AB1, SSPC-AB 2, SSPC-AB3, and SSPC-SP 1. Proposed new primer/paint is Intergard 264 Epoxy and shall be applied in accordance with Intergard 264 technical datasheet. All work shall be conducted in compliance with applicable federal OSHO standards as well as all other applicable federal, state, and local regulations.
Planned Acquisition: A contract delivering two LTVs with external and internal surface finish refurbishment by 1/31/2014 is needed. The Government is seeking information on vendors who have past experience in protecting personnel and the environment while removing hazardous paint in confined spaces and in dealing with very heavy items.
  

Submission Information: All responsible, interested sources are requested to submit a capability statement including their capabilities, list of specialized machines and equipment, critical skills and abilities, examples of past experience, evidence of successful Safety Program, and a Quality Management System certificate if applicable. Interested firms that can meet all the requirements set forth above are requested to submit responses with clear and convincing documentation via email or fax to the point of contact listed. Submittal of information is requested via electronic mail only, no later than 15 days from the date of this notice.

There will be no "phase-in" period for these requirements. The contractor shall have sufficient, fully qualified staff to meet all requirements ordered under the ESS CLIN at any time.<br /><br />The training requirements to be provided by the contractor for all PSOs working under this effort can be broken down into four categories:<br /><br />One Time Only:<br />40 hour Basic Training<br />Initial Weapons Training<br />Orientation Training<br />Supervisor Training<br /><br />Annual:<br />AED<br />CPR<br />Less-Than-Lethal Weapons (i.e. Baton/OC Spray)<br /><br />Semi-Annual: <br />Weapons<br /><br />Every Three Years:<br />First-Aid<br />Refresher Training<br /><br />This acquisition is for approximately 432,000 hours of basic service, 4,500 hours of temporary additional services and 12,500 hours of emergency security services per year.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with HOV Services/LASON Systems Incorporated, 11850 Hempstead Highway, Suite 270, Houston, TX 77092. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and related services; the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>The FBI currently collects blood and buccal samples from Federal, Military and District of Columbia Convicted Offenders as outlined in the DNA Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, USA Patriot Act of 2001 and the Justice For All Act of 2004. Recent passage of the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005 expands the scope of collection to include all Federal arrestees as well as non-US citizen detainees. In order to comply with this legislation and be able to process the exponential increase in samples being submitted to the FBI, the program requires a preventive maintenance agreement to ensure the successful operation and to maintain optimum performance of our optical character recognition software package known as TurboScan 2000 that is provided by HOV Services/LASON Systems, Inc.</p>
<p>HOV Services/LASON Systems, Inc. is the only provider of this service as they are the sole provider of the TurboScan 2000 software package. HOV Services/LASON Systems, Inc. is the only company that will be able to modify the configurations as they are the only company that provides the TurboScan software.</p>
<p><br />Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by HOV Services/LASON Systems, Inc., as no other vendor is capable of providing the TurboScan 2000 software that is needed for direct support of the FBI's mission.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office by 08:00 am, EST, by Oct 22, 2012, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>The awardee shall be registered in the Central Contractor's Database (CCR) and also the Online Representations and Certification (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

<DESC>Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific) intends to increase the contract ceiling by $8,366,000 on contract number N66001-08-D-0055, awarded to Tactical Engineering and Analysis, Inc. (TEA). This contract provides support for Test Engineering, Analysis, Prototype development, and Evaluation (TAPE) for MIDS, JTIDS, JTRS, and Aegis BMD systems including evaluation of other applications for solving U.S. military TDL communications problems.  This increase in contract ceiling will be awarded without providing for full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). No source, Government or industry, other than TEA is currently capable of providing these highly specialized services without an unacceptable delay.  TEAs fundamental understanding of current TDL and Navy combat systems is crucial to ensure continuity of uninterrupted support of the following critical ongoing programs/projects for which TEA has demonstrated effective and efficient expertise:  Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Aegis Afloat and Ashore; Tactical Data Links (TDL) Testing and Evaluation (T&E); Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS); Link Monitoring and Management Tool (LMMT); Accelerated Midterm Interoperability Improvement Project (AMIIP); Distributed Engineering Plant (DEP); Tactical Data Link (TDL) Foreign Military Sales (FMS).  Any interruption of this support will negatively affect the mission capability of the Navy and the DoD.  Due to the nature of the above listed programs and their direct support of the Navy, Joint Services, and Allies for pre-deployment interoperability testing and combat system assessments, any delay or interruption of support will impact Deployment schedules as well as combat readiness.  The anticipated period of performance for the proposed acquisition is from the effective date of contract modification award through the expiration date of the contract, 22 September 2013. No extension is required. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all interest and capability statements received within 15 days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. Questions concerning this modification may be directed to Brandon Spaulding, SSC Pacific Contracts Specialist, at brandon.spaulding@navy.mil or (619) 553-2549.

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency Energy (DLA Energy) has issued a DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) for the privatization of the electric, natural gas, and water distribution and wastewater collection systems at Grand Forks Air Force Base (AFB), North Dakota and Cavalier Air Force Station (AFS), North Dakota. The draft solicitation is available on the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov/. The RFP Section J Attachments are contained in the secure package titled SPE600-13-9501. DLA Energy anticipates issuing the official RFP in the near future. DLA Energy anticipates this issuance to reflect a revision to a clause and the response date of January 14, 2013 will remain the same.<br /><br />DLA Energy will hold a Pre-Proposal Conference on November 6, 2012 at Grand Forks AFB with a Site Visit to be held for Grand Forks AFB on November 7, 2012 and for Cavalier AFS on November 8, 2012. In order for interested parties to attend the Pre-Proposal Conference and/or Site Visits, please submit the list of attendees to Sherry.Saurage@dla.mil, Tricia.Castillo@dla.mil, and Carla.Biver@dla.mil by October 24, 2012. The DLA Energy Contracting Office will forward specific information regarding security requirements in order for vendors to obtain access onto Grand Forks AFB. <br /><br />Additionally, electronic copies of the Technical Library to include maps and technical data will be made available to offerors to the maximum extent possible. The Technical Library information will be available at the Pre-proposal Conference for those interested parties that request a copy and already obtained a Joint Certification Program (JCP) certification (see below note regarding registering for JCP certification) no later than October 26, 2012. Please be advised that only one copy of the Technical Library will be available per company. Non-disclosure agreements may be required by the Installation, and if required, will be provided to offerors when registering for the pre-proposal conference. For those interested parties that are not able to attend the Pre-Proposal Conference and/or Site Visit, please submit a request to the individuals in the paragraph above, and provide the company mailing address where FedEx packages can be received and we will mail you a copy of the Technical Library. <br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: To access the secured documents on the FBO website, all vendors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) first and foremost. If you are registered in CCR, once you click on the secured document link in the FBO, it should prompt you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form, in order to complete the JCP certification. All vendors are required to fill out and submit the DD2345 form. Instructions for submission of that form can be found in that link as well. For any additional questions or help, please visit the FBO Help Desk, which can be reached at https://www.fsd.gov/app/answers/list or by calling 1-866-606-8220.
<p><br />If you are not registered in CCR, you will need to register in the System for Award Management (SAM). SAM is a Federal Government owned and operated free web site that consolidates the capabilities found in the old CCR/Federal Agency Registry (FedReg), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) websites. All records from CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS, active or expired, were moved to the SAM website. If you have a registered account in CCR, you can utilize your CCR user name and password in SAM, but only after creating a SAM account. Keep in mind that it takes 48-72 hours for the registration process in SAM to be complete. The SAM website is located at https://sam.gov/. Vendors must also request and be approved for explicit access to each solicitation in order to view the secure packages. For any additional questions or help, please visit the SAM Help Desk which can be accessed by selecting the Help Tab at the top of the SAM homepage.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>1.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective June 7, 2012 electronically. IMPORTANT: CURRENT SCHEDULE 066 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated.

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website. The ORCA website can be accessed https://orca.bpn.gov.

Please note that any offer submitted after July 6, 2012 MUST be submitted on the Solicitation dated June 7, 2012 (Refresh #10) and must be submitted through the eOffer system. Offers submitted on prior versions received after July 6, 2012 will not be accepted.

Schedule 73 Food Service, Hospitality, Cleaning Equipment and Supplies, Chemicals, and Services

Synopsis:

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Please note with this refresh you must complete the mandatory Readiness Assessment free self evaluation, available on the Vendor Support Center website at https://vsc.gsa.gov.  From the VSC home page, click on Tool box in the upper left corner and complete the Research, Analyze, and Decide modules.  The Decide module contains a questionnaire that must be completed by an officer of the company (President, VP, CEO, CFO, etc.) and must be submitted with your offer in order to gain consideration.

<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are hereby incorporated by full text:</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number:  DTNH22-13-R-00646
<p>This synopsis is being posted for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. The RFP is attached.</p>
<p>THIS SOLICITATION was orginally synopsized under DTNH22-11-R-000508 as follows:</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (an operating administration of the United States Department of Transportation) is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths on the highways resulting from vehicle crashes. In support of this mission, the NHTSA issues contracts for conduct of large scale surveys to determine the degree to which vehicle operators and passengers use occupant protection devices. Those surveys include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; The National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS),</p>
<p>&bull; The National Survey of the Use of Booster Seats (NSUBS), and</p>
<p>&bull; The Seat Belt Use by Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers (SBUCMVD) survey.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The NOPUS is the vehicle through which the Agency tracks progress in restraint use (namely, safety belt use, child restraint use, and motorcycle helmet use) and estimates the use of cell phones by drivers. In addition to providing the Agency's official estimates in these subject areas, the survey provides information on who is using restraints and in what circumstances, which is in turn used to target the Agency's occupant protection outreach programs where they are most needed.</p>
<p>The purpose of the NSUBS is to produce the Agency's first estimates of booster seat use and to better inform the Agency on the extent to which children are in the proper type of child safety seat for their size. In addition to providing the Agency's official estimates in these areas, the survey's detailed results will help the Agency target its child occupant protection outreach programs where they are most needed.</p>
<p>The SBUCMVD provides the Federal Motor Carrier Service Administration (FMCSA) official estimates of safety belt use by drivers of large trucks and helps NHTSA target its occupant protection outreach programs where they are most needed.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>NHTSA's objective is to receive professional services in support of all 3 (NOPUS, NSUBS, and SBUCMVD) national surveys.</p>
<p>Solicitation Information:</p>
<p>The Government contemplates that a Time and Material type Contract with a period of performance not to exceed sixty (60) months will be awarded.  The forthcoming solicitation and any related documents to this procurement will only be available electronically for download at https://www.fedbizopps.gov referenced by the solicitation number (DTNH22-11-R-00508).  The anticipated issuance date of the forthcoming solicitation is on or about October 31, 2011. However, it is the Offeror's sole responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will also be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), as well as other related documents.</p>
<p>NO FURTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVALABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>a) BACKGROUND. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns/operates four DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft in various locations throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It has been determined that one of these DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft will be based out of the Hyannis, MA area to be operated in support of critical marine mammal surveys, law enforcement and marine sanctuary related research. Due to winter weather conditions in the Hyannis area, it is necessary that the Twin Otter aircraft be kept in a hangar during the period November 15, 2012 through March 15, 2013. The hangar will protect the aircraft from the environment as well as protect the flight crew and maintenance personnel while performing routine maintenance and pre and post-flight activities through the winter months.</p>
<p>SCOPE: <br />NOAA Twin Otter aircraft will be operating out of Hyannis, MA in support of marine mammal surveys in the Atlantic Ocean. There will be a NOAA Twin Otter mechanic in Hyannis supporting the aircraft at all times except for short periods when the mechanic's services are requested to support aircraft in other locations. Only one Twin Otter is required in the hangar at one time. However, if maintenance or equipment installation is required, there may be a request to shift one aircraft out on the ramp to allow another one access.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide heated hangar space for one (1) DHC-6 Twin Otter having a wing span of 65 feet and 19 feet high at the tail. Heated hangar means that the hangar is maintained at a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Flight crews shall have access to the aircraft 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The contractor can determine if access will be available using on-site personnel that are available at any time, or if not available, issue keys to the flight crews for the hangar where the aircraft is stored.</p>
<p>Security clause 1352.239-73 does not apply to the SOW and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>The following services are requested as part of the hangar rental price. If there are extra charges or fees for any of these services in addition to the fixed base hangar rental price, provide separate pricing information for each item:</p>
<p>1)Ground support equipment use including:<br />a)DC external power unit,<br />b)Ground service equipment on an as needed basis,<br />c)Tow vehicle for aircraft movement in and out of hangar. <br />2)Hangar amenities including: tools, equipment, consumables, phones, heat and DC power,<br />3)24-hour access for maintenance and flight crew,<br />4)Storage space in hangar for extra gear and equipment 5 ft x 5 ft,<br />5)Acceptance of Multiservice Air Card for payment of incidentals.</p>
<p>b) PERFORMANCE PERIOD. The hangar lease is required from November 15, 2012 thru March 15, 2013. However, the Government reserves the right to depart early from the survey site and from use of the hangar without incurring any additional fees or penalties associated with departing earlier than March 15, 2013. At the conclusion of the lease, Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government.</p>
<p>c) INSURANCE. The contractor shall at its own expense, provide and maintain hull liability insurance of not less than $2,000,000.00 to cover the aircraft in the event of fire or any catastrophic damage to the hangar resulting in loss or damage to the aircraft. Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained along with a copy of the insurance certificate.</p>

N00244L332, UNIT PRICES (OCT 2001) (FISC SAN DIEGO)
Contractor unit prices, when incorporated into a Government contract, will be released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) without further notice to the contractor submitter.  If the Contractor takes issue with the release, it should submit its proposal data with the appropriate legends and explain in detail why such data cannot be released as a public record under the Freedom of Information Act.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation: The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and price related factors.
 The Government intends to award the contract to the eligible, low-priced, responsible offeror (see FAR 15.304).  Award will be made upon price reasonableness determination, contractor determination of responsibility within the meaning of FAR Part 9, and acceptance to the provisions set forth herein. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
(i)	Ability to perform per the statement of work
(ii)	Provide the service for the stated period of performance 
(iii)	Price
The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and factor (ii), the two non-price factors. (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.)
Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria.
 Under this factor, the Government will rate the vendors ability to perform per the statement of work as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factor (ii). Under this factor, the Government will rate the vendors availability to provide the service for the stated period of performance as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award.
 
For those proposals that are rated acceptable on factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price.  Ability to perform per the statement of work and provide the service for the stated period of performance, when combined, are equal to price. 
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
(b) The Governments statement of work is attached.  Ability to meet the statement of work shall be demonstrated by the offerors submission of a Word document that addresses how they will accomplish all applicable objectives, tasks and guidelines.
  Please submit no more than a 2 page Word document, font size 12, double spaced.      
(c) The Governments period of performance is clearly defined above.  Ability to meet the period of performance shall be demonstrated by the offerors submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required date and terms.
A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or electronically furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
 
This announcement will close at 1 PM PST on 26 October 2012.  Submit offers via email to Shannon La Com who can be reached at (T) 619.556.9096 or email Shannon.lacom@navy.mil .  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  
 
Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.sam.gov/  . 
 
Any questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted no later than close of business Tuesday October 23, 2012.  Questions received after this date will not be considered.  All questions must be submitted via e-mail to Shannon.lacom@navy.mil.

<DESC>ART IN ARCHITECTURE PROJECT<br />GSA Synopsis for Artist Services<br />Artist Services Synopsis Number:  GS-09P-13-KT-C-0003
<p><br />FBO Classification:  R499<br />NAICS:  711510</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.</p>
<p>GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the new construction of U.S. Courthouse in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
<p>This project provides for the construction of a new courthouse in downtown Los Angeles, CA. The site/design and construction prospectus will be designed to meet the amended 30-year requirements of the U.S. District Courts and related agencies with the initial build-out to house the 10-year housing requirements.  The Project involves the design and construction of an approximately 600,000 gross square foot courthouse, including 110 controlled-access indoor parking spaces, in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>This Project is an opportunity in design and construction excellence. GSA intends to build a new United States Courthouse that shall be a focus of pride for the community it serves, as well as the nation. The Project shall be a functional, innovative, sustainable, cost-effective, state-of-the-art, court facility that will contribute to the overall design quality of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p>GSA generally allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs for new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions.  The art budget for the new U.S. Courthouse project is currently estimated to be $1,500,000.  One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</p>
<p>Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artist Registry (Registry).  The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions.  Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</p>
<p>www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</p>
<p>All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the U.S. Courthouse in Los Angeles, CA, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on November 30, 2012.  Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for this project, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry.  Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline.  If any technical questions arise regarding this posting please contact Mr. William Caine, Art in Architecture Program, Office of the Chief Architect at william.caine@gsa.gov or 202.501.4271.</p>
<p>GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist's past work, along with the artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis.  Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a price proposal for the contemplated project.  GSA has determined that the combined weight of all the technical selection criteria is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the building project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and the installation of the artwork at the project site.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester shall file a formal agency protest to both the contracting officer and the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). 
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>This technical assistance funding for SEINFRA will serve several purposes. First, it will help the State of Bahia to prioritize upgrades for Feira de Santana Airport, located in the state's second largest municipality. Second, the technical assistance will also provide a program to update the remainder of the state's airport network by identifying modernization needs and key technologies to allow night operation capabilities at eight priority airports identified by SEINFRA. These technologies would then be replicated to the entire state's airport network in order of priority.</p>
<p>The State of Bahia is the largest state in northeastern Brazil in terms of economic output, fifth largest in size, and the fourth most populous in the country. SEINFRA is responsible for the planning, coordination, supervision, and implementation of studies, programs, and public works, in the transport, energy and communications sectors in the State, including airport infrastructure, as well as cargo and logistics projects.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $345,060 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(s) Order of precedence.

<p>(t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the <br />Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>WAWF<br />EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT<br />(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.) This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment. <br />(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process<br />Acceptor: The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered. The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of, stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .<br />(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the "Send More E-Mail Notifications" link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1). This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice<br />Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html .

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective June 7, 2012 electronically. IMPORTANT: CURRENT SCHEDULE 066 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NOTICE: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website.

<DESC>This notice is a request for information (RFI) and is not a request for proposals (RFP). The government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it. Proprietary information should be clearly marked. The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and will not be publicly released. In accordance with FAR 15.201(E), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
<p>This is a FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT requesting technology information on rapid sample-to-sequence genomic sequencing systems.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The Research and Technology Directorate under Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) is seeking market research and potential sources for available commercial sample preparation and genomic sequencing systems. Platforms of particular interest are those that support rapid sample processing, sequence-ready nucleic acid preparation, and whole genome shotgun sequencing read output, all with minimal human intervention (i.e., "Sample-to-sequence"). The scope of the information being sought covers the processing and sequencing of unknown aqueous clinical and aqueous environmental samples to identify viral and/or bacterial components. This RFI does not support the development of such a system but seeks to evaluate existing capabilities. Submitters may be contacted to participate in an evaluation of their system hosted at ECBC in Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Maryland. Vendors both domestic and international are encouraged to respond. Submitters are advised to include all necessary participation expenses. These will be factored into the selection criteria. Selection for inclusion into the evaluation does not guarantee all expenses can be met.</p>
<p>PART I - Technical Criteria</p>
<p>The system should be able to support the sample processing of unknown clinical or environmental samples through to genomic sequencing and provide sequencing read data that can be used to identify viral and/or bacterial components. This request for information is focused solely on the sample-to-sequence capability and not the subsequent data analysis or assembly software. This evaluation does not require the use of select agents as equipment will be operating under BSL1/2 conditions. Specific information of interest is as follows:</p>
<p>&bull;Candidate systems must support complex sample processing from initial sample addition to shotgun sequencing read output including: nucleic acid extraction if necessary, nucleic acid sequencing preparation, and sequence read generation, all with minimal manual manipulation. Vendors must include an outline of the process from start to finish, the time involved in all processing steps including manual steps, and all components used.</p>
<p>&bull;Description must include existing system footprint, hardware specifications, power requirements, and a detailed description of the manual steps. Smaller specifications for size, weight, and power (SWAP) will be favored. Incorporate a concept for how SWAP could be reduced in future system models including a system footprint reduction to one cubic foot; include an outline/schedule and timeline for a realistic approach for such and all associated costs.</p>
<p>&bull;Include list of logistics, reagents, materials and associated costs. Favor will be given toward systems that have a lower logistical burden (i.e., battery, chemicals, refrigerated consumables, etc) and lower overall cost.</p>
<p>&bull;System may be separated into components that collectively support sample processing, sequence-ready nucleic acid preparation, and sequence read generation.</p>
<p>&bull;A description of how whole genome shotgun sequencing reads could be generated in approximately one hour of complex sample insertion should be included as well as the time involved for the existing system.<br /><br />&bull;System may contain software and firmware to coordinate sample processing and sequencer activities.</p>
<p>&bull;Sensitivity of system should be optimized to identify organisms in sample at low concentrations, i.e., 10 organisms in one sample.</p>
<p>&bull;Sample processing should support sample inputs of unknown aqueous clinical and aqueous environmental samples potentially containing bacterial cells and/or viral particles.</p>
<p>PART II - Submission of Information</p>
<p>Vendors desiring to respond to this request should provide a white paper as follows:</p>
<p>White Paper:</p>
<p>Limit the number of pages to four (4) total (Times New Roman, Font 12, one inch margins) excluding cover and photos which can be included separately. Interested vendors are also asked to submit a quad chart as a summary template. Describe technology including, at a minimum, the specific information of interest stated in Part I. Other information of potential interest that vendors could include are current and investigational applications of product, future commercial developments, references that document utility of the system or product, and photographs of complete system and components.</p>
<p>To be responsive to this announcement a vendor must supply their information as requested by 31 December 2012 as a Microsoft Word document. The recipient email address is: stacey.m.broomall.civ@mail.mil. At least one image of the full system should be submitted as a jpeg file with email file sizes not to exceed 3 megabytes. Vendors are requested to provide the name of Contact Person, telephone number, FAX number, email and complete address with each submission of data.</p>

The Bureau of Reclamation intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a firm fixed price construction contract for the modifications to the Stampede Dam.  This procurement will be set-aside for Small Business Concerns only.  Stampede Dam is located approximately 10 Miles northeast of Truckee, CA in Sierra County.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 and the related small business size standard is $33.5M.  
The following four sections present principal components of work, but do not address all work items or tasks required for completion of the project:
1. Dam Crest Structure - Stampede Dam will be raised with a mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) wall.  The wall will be designed by the contractor within preset government parameters.  This work will include excavating the existing dam and dike, foundation preparation, excavating/processing/hauling material from a borrow area, constructing two parallel MSE walls, placing and compacting mechanically stabilized earth fill with soil reinforcement, installation of a drainage system, design and construction of a vehicular barrier and asphalt road work.  
2. Spillway Construction - To accommodate the dam raise, the existing concrete spillway will be demolished and reconstructed.  This work will include constructing an earth-fill cofferdam, removing existing concrete and constructing complex reinforced cast-in-place concrete. 
3. Construct Saddle Dikes - As part of the project, two small saddle dikes will be constructed.  This work will include excavation, foundation preparation, furnishing and placing compacted embankment material and re-routing existing roads. 
4. Other - Other major items of work included with this project are: tree clearing, construction of haul roads and use areas, constructing a two mile paved detour for public access to the reservoir, obtaining and implementing the 402 California Storm Water Construction General Permit, working within other various environmental work restrictions, and creating and implementing a restoration plan for all disturbed areas.     
The estimated cost of this project is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.  This procurement will require 100% performance and payment bonds.

<RESPDATE>111412
<CONTACT>He3Auction@science.doe.gov He3Auction@science.doe.gov, Email He3Auction@science.doe.gov
<DESC><p align="left">&nbsp;AMENDED NOTICE: The U.S. Department of Energy (Department) has been participating in an Interagency Group to manage the federal supply of helium-3 (He-3). The Interagency Group assesses and prioritizes requests for He-3 necessary for the federal mission, while simultaneously taking steps to decrease demand and increase supply. The success of the Interagency Group has mitigated short- to mid-term impacts of a He-3 shortage. In recognition of the important activities requiring He-3 that are outside of the federal mission, the Department has identified 4,000 liters of purified He-3 gas for competitive sale. Stakeholders whose Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 He-3 needs will be met by the federal allocation process, or who submitted requests for He-3 gas through a U.S. federal agency in anticipation of participating in the FY 2013 federal allocation process, should not participate in this auction. The Department wishes to sell the He-3 to multiple Bidders who submit the highest bids in a competitive bid process. If a Bidder requests a total amount of He-3 up to and including 100 liters, the lot sizes must be in increments of 25 liters or a single 100 liter lot. If a Bidder requests 100 liters of He-3 or more, the lot sizes must be in increments of 100 liters. Initially, each Bidder will be limited to 400 liters, but may bid on unlimited lots. Should there be any He-3 remaining after the 400 liter limit has been reached by all Bidders, then remaining gas will go to the highest Bidder.</p>
<p>He-3 is stored and will be delivered in cylinders with a Compressed Gas Association 580 brass valve. Unless otherwise specified by the Bidder, each cylinder will contain a nominal 100 liters of purified He-3, standard temperature and pressure. Cylinders are designed to U.S. Department of Transportation specification, 3AA 2015, and are refillable cylinders.</p>
<p>DOE's Invitation for Bids (IFB) for the purchase of He-3 gas is scheduled to be posted on <strong>http://www.isotopes.gov/he-3auction </strong>on <strong>October 9, 2012 </strong>and will be available for downloading from this website. The Department will accept questions regarding the IFB. All questions must be submitted to He3auction@science.doe.gov no later than <strong>5 PM (Eastern Standard Time) October 23, 2012. </strong>DOE will respond to all questions by <strong>5 PM (Eastern Standard Time) October 26, 2012</strong>. DOE will post all questions received and their corresponding answers on the website http://www.isotopes.gov/he-3auction. The identity of the stakeholder posing the question will be kept anonymous and will not be posted on the website.</p>
<p>All valid bids to purchase He-3 gas must be received by the U.S. Department of Energy no later than <strong>5 PM</strong>, local prevailing time (Washington, DC) on <strong>November 14, 2012</strong>. The Department requires bids from qualified Bidders be submitted in <strong>electronic format </strong>to He3auction@science.doe.gov<strong>. </strong>A confirmation of receipt will be sent electronically within 24 hours of the next business working day. <strong>Bids will not be accepted via U.S. Postal Service mail. </strong></p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (an operating administration of the United States Department of Transportation) is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths on the highways resulting from vehicle crashes.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The NOPUS is the vehicle through which the Agency tracks progress in restraint use (namely, safety belt use, child restraint use, and motorcycle helmet use) and estimates the use of cell phones by drivers. In addition to providing the Agency's official estimates in these subject areas, the survey provides information on who is using restraints and in what circumstances, which is in turn used to target the Agency's occupant protection outreach programs where they are most needed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The purpose of the NSUBS is to produce the Agency's first estimates of booster seat use and to better inform the Agency on the extent to which children are in the proper type of child safety seat for their size. In addition to providing the Agency's official estimates in these areas, the survey's detailed results will help the Agency target its child occupant protection outreach programs where they are most needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The SBUCMVD provides the Federal Motor Carrier Service Administration (FMCSA) official estimates of safety belt use by drivers of large trucks and helps NHTSA target its occupant protection outreach programs where they are most needed.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">NHTSA's objective is to receive professional services in support of all 3 (NOPUS, NSUBS, and SBUCMVD) national surveys.</span></p>

It consists of two workstations separated by a center console and an equipment enclosure. The equipment is mounted on a 62-inch by 108-inch cargo pallet for the roll-on / roll-off capabilities and it interfaces mechanically with the aircraft's cargo handling system.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". As implemented by FAR Subsection 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A)(B), "Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements."</p>

<AWARDEE>LINK2HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC.;50 BROADWAY FL 19;NEW YORK;NY;100043814
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
SOLE SOURCE AWARD


1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs 
                                         	Veterans Health Administration
     	Strategic Acquisition Center
     	10300 Spotsylvania Avenue
Suite 400
Fredericksburg, VA 22408
   
2.  Description of Action:  This proposed sole source justification and approval is for the award of a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract for one (1) year with two (2) one year options to Link2Health Solutions, Inc. (Link2Health), 50 Broadway FL 19, New York, NY 10004, to manage calls from Veterans placed on the National Suicide Prevention Hotline for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  Services include routing all incoming calls from Veterans and their families to the Veterans Crisis Line and providing technical assistance and crisis response training to the personnel at the Veterans Crisis Line.  Additional services include managing the Veterans suicide chat services and text messaging, and the VA suicide prevention web site. 

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  In 2007, a decision was made that VA would establish a national suicide hotline number using the National Suicide Prevention Hotline, 1-800-273-8255, ("Hotline") as an access point into the VA Veterans Crisis Line and Chat Services which is a VA staffed national 24-hour toll-free suicide prevention service for Veterans and their family members in suicidal crisis who are seeking help.  Individuals can call the Hotline and as a Veteran press 1 to have their call immediately routed to the Veterans Crisis Line located in Canandaigua, New York.  VA staff at the Crisis Center will then refer the caller to the closest possible Veterans Health Administration provider of mental health and suicide prevention service.  Having a single recognizable toll-free number avoids confusion and is necessary to reach Veterans across the nation.  The Hotline is already well publicized and the foundation of a national network of suicide prevention services known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.  Currently, VA has a contract with Link2Health Solutions, Inc. for similar services and the contract is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2012.  The Hotline has been used since 2007 and VA requires that its use be continued uninterrupted. 
 
This proposed action requires a contractor to manage the incoming calls placed by Veterans on the Hotline in order to immediately route the calls to the Veterans Crisis Line.  Due to the high volume of calls placed by Veterans using the Hotline, VA requires that the contractor have the ability to accommodate spill-over calls by routing them to a designated National Suicide Prevention Lifeline crisis center in order to prevent any Veteran's call from not being immediately answered.  Additionally, VA requires that the contractor manage and route telephone calls placed by Veterans using Skype and to have the ability to route chats from the VA owned web site to the Veterans Crisis Line for immediate assistance should the situation warrant it as well as the ability to route mobile texts.  With regard to the web site, VA requires that the Contractor provide web site database maintenance support, technical assistance, and have the ability to produce reports as to calls placed by Veterans using the Hotline.  In conjunction with managing the Hotline, due to the high volume of calls placed by Veterans, VA requires that the Contractor have the ability to provide back-up response crisis centers staffed by trained crisis responders in order to supplement the Veterans Crisis Line.  To ensure that the  Veterans Crisis Line and the back-up centers handle suicide crisis situations consistently, VA requires that the Contractor  train Veterans Crisis Line personnel as needed in crisis response techniques and theory, suicide risk assessment and crisis response skills.  The total estimated price of the proposed action is $6,328,487. 

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition  is 41.U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5. Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Link2Health Solutions, Inc. is the only responsible source that can satisfy all VA requirements. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the Communications Act has assigned toll-free numbers to be used as National Suicide Prevention Hotline numbers.  The FCC has assigned these numbers, including the Hotline, exclusively to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which administers the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline program. 

On September 7, 2012 SAMHSA awarded a three (3) year grant to Link2Health Solutions, Inc., to administer SAMHSA's National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (Lifeline).  The grant award has an effective date of September 30, 2012.  Therefore, Link2Health Solutions, Inc. is the only entity permitted to use, manage and monitor the Hotline.  Furthermore, Link2Health Solutions, Inc., as the sole grantee of SAMHSA, administers the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and specifically is the only entity with the ability to ensure that all calls placed by Veterans on the Lifeline network (Hotline) are properly routed to the Veterans Crisis Line.  

The grant, however, does not provide for the routing of all incoming calls from Veterans to the Veterans Crisis Line.  For Link2Health Solutions, Inc., to route such calls, VA must contract with Link2Health Solutions, Inc. for this service.  Link2Health Solutions, Inc. is responsible to have multiple levels of back-up centers thus meeting VA's need that all calls must be answered even in the event the Veterans Crisis Line is busy.  Link2Health Solutions, Inc., as the only administer of the Hotline, is also the only entity which can manage chats placed on the VA website because of the interconnectivity between the Hotline and the computers for routing purposes.  As the sole administrator of the Hotline, it is also the only entity which can generate the reports as to the use of the Hotline by Veterans.  

Finally, among its duties for SAMHSA, Link2Health Solutions, Inc. is responsible to support crisis centers with training as to suicide risk assessment guidelines. In order to meet VA's need for consistent suicide prevention training between the Veterans Crisis Line and the backup centers, Link2Health Solutions, Inc., is the only source that can meet that need since it trains the personnel within the Lifeline network which includes the backup centers.  VA has an urgent need to address Veterans in trouble and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline as managed by Link2Health Solutions, Inc., will provide seamless coverage to allow immediate accessibility to the Veteran population through the use of Veterans Crisis Line and Chat Services.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research of this document.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements. There is no competition anticipated for this acquisition.  Additionally, the proposed action will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities in accordance with FAR 5.201. 

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  All future requirements will be handled on a case by case basis to determine any future acquisition strategy. 

8.  Market Research:  Link2Health Solutions, Inc., as the sole grantee, is the only entity recognized by Health and Human Services (HHS) and SAMHSA to use, manage, and monitor the three recognized national suicide numbers.  This includes the Hotline, which belongs to SAMHSA, as established by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC).  The Government's program manager placed a call to SAMHSA on September 12, 2012, and confirmed that no other entity has authority or a grant to manage the Hotline and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline network.  

9.  Other Facts:  The Procuring Contracting Officer has determined that this acquisition meets all FAR requirements under 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  This acquisition is estimated at $6,328,487 for total of three years inclusive of options.

10.  Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>FA5215-12-P-7022
<AWDDATE>091812
<ARCHDATE>11182012
<DESC>Justification and Approval <br />Limited Source Acquisition
<p><br />1. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: Department of the Air Force, 647th Contracting Squadron/LGCZ, 90 G Street, Building 1201, Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii 96853-5230.</p>
<p>2. NATURE AND DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED: Justification for brand name purchase for seventeen (17) Brocade FastIron network backbone switches remote support renewal for one year.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS: Renewal of remote warranty support is essential for maintaining critical functional services for Asia-Pacific for Security Studies (APCSS) network technology division. APCSS network infrastructure currently uses Brocade FastIron Switches as the network backbone connectivity switches between buildings with no problems. Remote support provides a single point of contact for hardware and software support, remote diagnostics and troubleshooting with the product vendor. Renewal of the Brocade warranty support is estimated at $8080.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: Per 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) and FAR 6.302-1, the supply or services required by the agency are available from one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.</p>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATE THAT THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED: FAR 6.302-1 provides for use of brand name descriptions when the requirement can only be met by one brand name product as in this case. The APCSS network utilizes Brocade FastIron Switches in the existing network infrastructure. The requested purchase will work seamlessly in the existing infrastructure. The switch management software used for Brocade switches is the same that is currently used. This will minimize the learning curve and/or education needed to bring the new switches online. This will also minimize the administrative costs to manage the switches since there will be only one interface to manage the existing and requested Brocade switches and only one vendor to call should a trouble call be needed. This will guarantee that there will be no conflicts in hardware and firmware and prevent the situation of vendors "pointing the finger at each other" should the switches encounter operational problems. Having one vendor to contact for support services minimizes potential downtime, speeds up resolution time for incident management, and maximizes reliability and efficiency of network infrastructure.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE: N/A</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE: The proposed price will be compared to previous buys for the same service. The Brocade switches are commercially available and the existing market provides for fair and reasonable pricing. In addition, the item is offered on the GSA schedules and in accordance with FAR 8.404(d) GSA has already determined the prices of items under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. However, the commercial market price is lower than the prices offered on GSA. The Brocade brand represents the best value to the Government and will result in the lowest overall cost alternative than award to other brands.<br /><br />8. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET SURVEY CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON A MARKET SURVEY WAS NOT CONDUCTED: Market research in the form of a web search shows that no other source of this nature is available. Brocade is a unique, one of a kind system and service. There are no other reasonable sources for this requirement. <br /><br />9. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: N/A</p>
<p>10. A LISTING OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING ANY INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION: None. No prospective offerors have expressed, in writing, an interest in providing an offer for this requirement. Based on the aforementioned, no sources are available to fulfill this requirement as in accordance with paragraph 8 above.</p>
<p>11. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED: All actions have been taken to provide competition for the commercially available item within the brand name limitation. APCSS will continue to seek additional sources that become available in the commercial market for this particular requirement.</p>
<p>12. TECHNICAL / REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION: I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.</p>
