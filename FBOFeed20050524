<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Hearing Loss Prevention Branch intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Eckel Industries, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts to furnish, deliver and install a 200-hertz cutoff supersoft chamber at the Pittsburgh facility.  The Hearing Loss Prevention Branch requires a hemi-anechoic test facility for the development of engineering noise controls for construction and mining equipment.  A hemi-anechoic chamber often consists of acoustic wedges attached to a concrete wall or similar structure.  In a hemi-anechoic environment, the measured sound levels are due to sound radiated directly from the object under test.  The acoustic treatments absorb the sound impinging on the walls.  The reverberant sound energy is therefore, negligible with regard to the measured sound levels.  This facility will greatly reduce the time and cost associated with developing engineering noise controls.  Eckel Industries is the manufacturer of a unique treatment for hemi-anechoic chambers called the Supersoft Panel.  The Supersoft Panel is protected by a perforated steel sheet making it suitable for performing testing that mey generate dust such as tests with roof bolting equipment and meets ISO 3744 Engineering Grade accuracy.  This announcement is being issued for informational purposes only; requests for quotations are not available.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which shall be considered by the Agency.  If any responses are submitted in response to this presolicitation notice and the agency determines to compete this requirement, a RFQ will be issued solely to the responders of this notice.  A subsequent presolicitation notice will not be issued.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate solely with Gelco Information Network GSD, Inc., 1860 Michael Faraday Drive, Suite 150, Reston, VA 20190-5304 for the purchase of Gelco Oracle Travel Manager Interface (OTMI) version 2.1.  Version 2.1 upgrade will be implemented with Travel Manger version 8.2.  This interface will add functionality to the interface that was developed in OTMI Release 1. The development and implementation of OTMI Release 2.1 upgrade will further reduce the number of documents with errors and expedite payment of vouchers.  Under the authority provided in Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.106-1(b), the Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  The software upgrade is not a COTS product and will be customized with additional requirements for a 12 month period of performance.  These tasks will validate/verify: 1) On-line Funds with Social Security Online Accounting and Reporting System (SSOARS) – TM shall provide for online funds validation with the SSOARS to verify that there are sufficient funds in the selected accounting code to obligate or pay for the travel document; 2)SOC and Trip Purpose on Vouchers – TM should verify that the trip purpose code selected on the voucher is valid for the accounting code and its SOC element. As part of the implementation of OTMI Release 1, this validation is performed on authorizations. In OTMI Release 2.1, this verification should be performed on the voucher as well, in the event that the user changes the trip purpose to something other than what was selected on the authorization; 3)Amendment Status Verification – TM should verify that the amended authorization has passed to the SSOARS before a voucher created from the amendment can be stamped “SIGNED” and routed. Also, TM should verify that all accounting code elements on the voucher match that of the amendment; 4)Routing List Validation – TM should verify that the routing list attached to the authorization, voucher or local voucher is not blank. If a routing list is not attached, then TM should report the condition back to the originator and should not allow the user to sign the document.  Gelco Information Network GSD, Inc. (GELCO) is the only known vendor source capable of providing the OTMI upgrade that will work in conjunction with Gelco Travel Manager and the (SSOARS). OTMI is therefore a proprietary application developed by GELCO and Oracle.  Other organizations possessing the requisite expertise and resources are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities, experience, and other pertinent data (including GSA Schedule information).  Pricing data may be submitted.  This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of an evaluation of the information received.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received.  Responses to this notice should be submitted by May 31, 2005, 3:00 p.m. Eastern time and should refer to GELCOCS0505.  The size limitation for email attachments is five megabytes per individual email message.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement.  The purpose of this notice is to announce the intent to award a contract on a sole source basis to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game for a base year and three option year periods. This contract shall be awarded in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  MMS anticipates awarding said contract to Alaska Department of Fish and Game for MMS' Satellite Tracking of Bowhead Whales requirement as specified below. This contract calls for the State of Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G Principal Investigators, Ms Lori Quakenbush and Dr. Robert Small) to work in collaboration with the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission (AEWC), Native Alaskan subsistence whalers and the North Slope Borough, Department of Wildlife Management (NSBDWM) to obtain necessary research permits, instrument bowhead whales with satellite transmitters (PTT's), and to monitor the whale's movements.  These findings, together with findings from previous studies, are to be analyzed and used by the Investigators to provide insight into certain bowhead behaviors, including: routes of migration, temporal patterns of migration, speed of travel, and residence times.  Data will also provide information relevant to management decisions about bowhead population stock definition.  The study must be highly coordinated among the above parties, and have a strong public outreach component, so as to minimize the chance of any impacts on Alaska Native subsistence activities taking place in the study area during the time of the study. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has created and leads collaboration necessary to accomplish this research. Undertaking the proposed study requires an unusual degree of coordination between Federal and State agencies, the NSB, and Native Subsistence whaling organizations and boat captains.  The PIs, Quakenbush and Small, are both senior marine mammal biologists with extensive publication records and considerable experience using satellite tracking technology on a variety of species, including beluga whales.  They have excellent rapport with the NSB and Alaska Native community that has been established over decades of close cooperation.   This notice is not a formal solicitation.  This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP).  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of quotation or offers received in response to this notice.  Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract on this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Any information received by the POC listed below by close of business June 8, 2005, will be considered by the government.  POC: Sharon Doerk, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS-2101, Herndon, VA 20170.  Questions must be emailed to Sharon.Doerk@mms.gov or faxed to Sharon Doerk at 703-787-1041.

<DESC>This solicitation is for the Design and Construction of the renovation of the Jessieville District Ranger's Office on the Ouachita National Forest near Jessieville, Arkansas.

This project consists of the construction of a 2,006 square foot addition to a single-story wood-framed office building, renovation of approximately 1,431 square feet of a 3,497 square foot building, construction of a new front entrance, ramps, sidewalks and pavers, stone walls, and associated site work and site utilities, and add alternates for additional items (roofing, carpeting, and light fixture replacement). It also includes further design development and preparation of working drawings and specifications required to completely describe and document all aspects of the renovation and construction, and is to be based upon the preliminary concept drawings prepared and provided by the Government within this solicitation.
Proposals will be evaluated using a two phase process considering qualifications, technical and price factors.

Phase I Proposals and Factors (Qualifications Phase): (1) Technical qualifications, which include experience and qualifications of individuals and firm(s) that will perform the design, (Professional Architects and Engineers), and of the individuals and firm(s) that will manage and execute the construction, including information on major subcontractors, and (2) Past performance of the offeror's team, including the architect-engineer and construction forces. 
After evaluation of the Phase I proposals, a maximum of five offerors will be asked to submit Phase II proposals, which will include: (1) Salient Characteristics;  (2) General method of approach to the project, including a proposed design and construction schedule; and (3) Price proposal in the Schedule of Items format.
Award may be made without further negotiations.  Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms from a price and technical standpoint.  The Government may, after evaluation, conduct further oral discussion with any or all offerors.  Award will be made to the Offeror: (1) whose proposal is technically acceptable and (2) whose technical/cost relationship is the "best value" to the Government.  Contract performance period is 240 calendar days. The Government's estimate is between $250,000 and $500,000.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 236220, and the small business size standard is $28.5 Million. The successful offeror will be required to furnish performance and payment bonds, each in the amount of 100% of the contract price prior to beginning construction.

B.   Past Performance 

The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the contract requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.  The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information.  

When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it related to all acquisition requirements such as cost, schedule, and performance, including standards of good workmanship; the administration aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  (See Section L for submission requirements.)

Past performance findings will be highly influential in determining the relative merits and risks associated with the offeror’s proposal in a comparative assessment with all competitors.  The Government will evaluate the reputation and quality of the offeror’s past performance.  The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror to other offerors.   Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  The Government is seeking to determine whether an offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices.  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, and the offeror’s response, or lack thereof, will be taken into consideration.  In investigating the offeror’s past performance, the Government will consider references submitted by the offeror and may consider information from other sources. 

C.    Price/Cost Evaluation

Price/Costs shall be provided in the format identified in Section L and will be evaluated on the basis of cost realism.  (See Section L for submission requirements.)   As discussed in FAR 15.404-1(d), cost realism analysis is the process of independently reviewing and evaluating specific elements of each offeror's proposed cost estimate to determine whether the estimated proposed cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirement; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror's technical proposal. Realism of prices and costs against technical/management proposals may be evaluated as a part of the overall evaluation. Costs will be evaluated as an objective and subjective factor.  All cost and pricing information required by Section L shall be provided and will be used to determine its allowability, allocability and reasonableness relative to the work to be performed under the proposed contract.  The negotiated rates for field overhead, prime’s overhead on subcontractors, prime’s home office overhead, and prime’s profit will be incorporated into the successful offeror’s contract and will be applied to the direct costs of all contract modifications, additive and deductive, (excluding modifications to exercise options).

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

Detailed information can be found in the FAR Case, as well as by visiting the Help section of the website at http://orca.bpn.gov.

The Contracting Officer may issue the second NTP within forty-five (45) calendar days after issuance of the first NTP. This solicitation is formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  This procurement will result in an evaluation of offerors based on evaluation factors that include (1) Past Performance, (2) Technical Qualifications, and (3) Technical Approach.  If necessary, a competitive range determination will be made for this solicitation which will be based on technical and price factors and will include all of the most highly rated proposals unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency.  For evaluation purposes only in determining the competitive range, the Government will calculate the total price proposal as the sum of the project.  After a competitive range determination is made and final proposal revisions (if necessary) are received, a best value award decision will be made.  Offerors are required to submit technical and price proposals for the project.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals for the project will not be considered for an award.  The Government will award the project based on the most advantageous combination of price and technical factors that result in the overall best value award to the Government.   If discussions are required, they will be conducted with each offeror in the competitive range.  At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror still in the competitive range will be given an opportunity to submit a final proposal revision.
Price and the overall technical rating are of equal weight for the award. RFP ISSUE DATE: The Government intends to issue the Request For Proposals (RFP) electronically by posting it on the NAVFAC website, www.esol.navfac.navy.mil, on or about June 8, 2005. A pre-proposal conference and site visit will be held within two weeks of issuance of the RFP at Shaw AFB.  The exact date, time, and location will be stipulated in the RFP.  Proposals will be due around July 8, 2005. The exact date will be stipulated in the RFP.  Offerors must register themselves on the Internet at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil. The official plan holders list will be maintained on and may be printed from the web site. Amendments will be posted on the web site for downloading.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This is a Small Business Set Aside.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to solicit proposals for Income Tax Advice and Assistance for the NIH Visiting Scientist Program under solicitation number NHLBI-OR-P-05-070.  The Acquisition Method used will be Total Small Business Set-Aside for a period of performance of one (1) year with four (4) twelve month renewable option years beginning with the effective date of the contract award. The anticipated effective date of award is September 30, 2005. 

This acquisition is in support of the Division of International Services. The mission of the Division of International Services (DIS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to provide the highest level of professional guidance and immigration-related services to the NIH intramural community, and to the visiting foreign scientists.  DIS also ensures that the NIH maintains compliance with all applicable U.S. immigration laws governing and/or regulating their stay in the United States as set forth by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Labor, and other government agencies pertaining to our foreign researchers, scholars, and other staff.  

All Visiting Program participants must pay U.S. income taxes, unless they are exempted by an income tax treaty between the United States and their country of residence (for tax purposes).  Although the tax assessment differs according to stipend/salary level (higher levels are taxed at higher rates), Visiting Program participants can expect to pay at least 14 percent of their stipend/salary in federal income tax.  All participants, including those exempted from federal tax, must pay state income taxes, depending on their state of residence.  Before leaving the United States, all foreign nationals must fulfill their tax obligations.  

Professional, expert advice on U.S. income taxation matters concerning international scientists at NIH is available, on a limited basis, through DIS, Office of Research Services, at no cost to the individual.  Those for whom the service is offered includes NIH Visiting Program participants (Visiting Fellows, Visiting Scientists), Guest Researchers, Special Volunteers, Special Experts and other nonimmigrant scientists at NIH in an official capacity. 

This is a request for contract to provide income tax advice and guidance services for visiting foreign scientists at the National Institutes of Health as required by the U.S. government.  

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed to provide income tax advice and guidance services for visiting foreign scientists at the National Institutes of Health.

Specifically, the Contractor shall:

1. Revise and update the existing "Income Tax Handbook for Visiting Foreign Scientists at the National Institutes of Health" (for newly arrived foreign scientists) to reflect the latest changes in the U.S. Tax Code applicable to foreign nationals, including changes in country specific information for those countries with which the United States has tax treaties.

The Handbook should be sectioned to separately address the tax issues of the different categories of foreign scientists at NIH (e.g. one section devoted to Visiting Fellows/grant recipients, one section to full time employees (FTEs) & Professional Services Contractors, and one section to Special Volunteers/Guest Researchers). 

A draft copy of the Handbook shall be provided to the Project Officer for review prior to final production.  The Handbook consists of approximately 36 pages.  Finished product will be reproduced by NIH printing facilities and delivered to DIS, with Contractor being responsible for picking up material for each Seminar.  Contractor will also make an electronic version of the Handbook available to the Project Officer for placement on the DIS web page. 

2. Assemble the "2005 Guide to Income Tax Preparation for Visiting Foreign Scientists at the National Institutes of Health."  The Preparation Guide is for assisting the NIH foreign scientist population in the preparation of their annual tax returns and shall consist of all necessary/relevant Federal and Maryland state tax forms; explanation of required statements; as well as samples of completed forms of frequently used Federal and Maryland State tax forms.  In addition to the samples included previously, a sample should be included which illustrates how short-term visitors who are reimbursed for per diem and travel expenses should file a tax return.

A draft copy of the Preparation Guide shall be provided to the Project Officer for review prior to final production.  Finished product will be reproduced by NIH printing facilities and delivered to DIS, with Contractor being responsible for picking up material for each Workshop.  Contractor will also make an electronic version of the Preparation Guide available to the Project Officer for placement on the DIS web page.

3. Develop curricula and present one (1) three-hour seminar per month for newly arrived foreign scientists.  These seminars are to be conduced at NIH facilities in Bethesda, MD and invitees would be newly arrived scientists from NIH facilities here in Bethesda as well as NIH facilities in Frederick, MD and Baltimore, MD.  The seminars should provide general information about U.S. tax obligations applicable to foreign nationals employed (FTEs) or otherwise conducting research (Visiting Fellows, Professional Services Contractors, Special Volunteers, Guest Researchers, Exchange Scientists) at the NIH in Bethesda or NIH facilities in Frederick and Baltimore.  A question and answer session must be included at the end of each seminar.  The Project Officer will provide the contractor with a list of registered attendees (scientists) and the contractor shall take attendance and provide the Project Officer with names of the attendees.  In order to evaluate performance, an evaluation will be distributed to and collected from the foreign scientists attendees and returned to the Project Officer.

A small number of NIH foreign scientists are located at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratory, Hamilton, Montana (approximately 25); the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch, Phoenix, Arizona (approximately 15); and the National Institute of Environmental Health Scientists, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina (approximately 150).  For those foreign scientists located at the above mentioned remote locations, where no tax seminars for new arrivals will be conducted, the contractor shall answer questions via FAX or e-mail.  Depending on availability of the facilities, some seminars and/or workshops may include attendance of the out-of-town scientists by video teleconferencing. 

4. Develop curricula and present eight (8) six-hour Tax Preparation Workshops during the period February 15 and April 7 with specific emphasis on the preparation of Federal and state income tax forms in advance of the annual April 15 filing deadline.  The Workshops shall consist of two (2) three-hour sessions, allowing time for a lunch break.  Each session shall include time for questions-and-answers from the participants.  Six of these Workshops will be conducted at NIH facilities in Bethesda, Maryland.  In addition, one Workshop will be held in Baltimore, Maryland and one will be held in Frederick, Maryland, for the NIH foreign scientist population stationed at these off-campus locations.

For the approximately 150 foreign scientists located in North Carolina, the contractor shall provide one (1) on-site tax Preparation Workshop.  For the foreign scientists located in the other defined “remote locations” (Montana and Arizona), the contractor shall answer questions by fax or e-mail.

If the contractor finds it necessary to change the dates or times of any of the above mentioned seminars or workshops after they have been scheduled and advertised, the ORS/DIS should be given at least two weeks to reschedule meeting facilities and notify the foreign scientist community of the change.  Every effort should be made by the contractor to have a qualified alternate conduct the seminars.  When there are unforeseen situations such as extreme weather conditions or illness, the contractor shall contact the ORS/DIS as early as possible.

5. Provide flyers announcing time and location of seminars and workshops.  The flyers should specify the appropriate workshop to be attended by scientists (such as “morning session to be attended by “treaty-eligible foreign scientists” and “afternoon session to be attended by those individuals not eligible for a foreign tax treaty”.  Flyers will be provided to contact persons in the Institutes/Centers (ICs) for distribution to foreign scientists.  Announcement of the time and location of the workshops will be announced on DIS’ web page. 

When available from the Internal Revenue Service, provide ORS/DIS with forms and instructions for preparing estimated tax payments for Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia.  If requested, obtain forms and instructions for Montana, Arizona, and North Carolina.  The contractor shall also provide Federal and state (for above listed states) withholding forms to ORS/DIS as soon as they are available.

6. Provide the ORS/DIS Tax Project Officer & DIS Staff with written guidance on the latest changes in the U.S. Tax Code, tax treaties (including copies) and any other tax-related issues affecting foreign scientists conducting research at NIH.  Where tax treaty issues are involved, the guidance should take into account that NIH must be protected from under withholding.  Also, the contractor shall recognize that any written or verbal information supplied to ORS/DIS must address implementation issues along with any tax opinions.

7. Provide up to 36 hours per year consultation to ORS/DIS on tax issues raised by DIS staff.  This consultation shall include two sessions as requested by the Project Officer.  One session will be presented in the month of October and the second session will be presented at the beginning of the calendar year to discuss tax law changes affecting foreign individuals and their employment at NIH.  Consultation time will also include tax queries that the Project Officer receives from DIS staff and forwards on to the contractor.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Safety Research (DSR), Protective Technology Branch (PTB) has a requirement for harness design and sizing effectiveness.  The use of full-body fall-protection harnesses has been a critical work practice control for reducing the number of falls-from-elevation-related severe injuries and fatalities.  To improve the efficacy of these devices, NIOSH DSR has proposed a series of studies on full-body harness sizing and design parameters.  Elliptic Fourier (EF) method is one of the few techniques that have been developed to quantify human torso shape and size for potential harness design application.  NIOSH proposes to use the EF method to extract shape information from the Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource (CAESAR) data, based on the EF equations and sizing scheme developed in a recent NIOSH study.  The goal is to define the optimal adjustment range of each harness component for both vest type and over-the-head type harnesses.  We intend to negotiate on a sole source basis with Anthrotech, Inc., Yellow Springs, Ohio to devise a series of analyses that determine the optimal adjustment range of each harness component, based on the Elliptic Fourier prediction equations and CAESAR data.  The contract will include three phases.  Phase 1 is to develop a sampling strategy for mining the CAESAR data; a sample in the proximity of 600 out of the 2340 CAESAR subjects is suggested.  The second phase is to use the Elliptic Fourier (EF) procedure to determine the EF coefficients of torsos for the selected subjects.  The best-fit harness size of each selected subject will be calculated.  Phase 3 will classify the selected CAESAR subjects into different harness size groups, and use a weighted statistical approach to determine the optimal adjustment range for each harness component, for each harness-size category.  A full set of the CAESAR database will be available to the awardee for the task.  During phase 3 of the task, interactions with harness manufacturers are required to finalize the final harness-component adjustment range.  This announcement is being issued for informational purposes only; request for quotations are not available.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which shall be considered by the Agency.  If any responses are submitted in response to this presolicitation notice and the agency determines to compete this requirement, a RFQ will be issued solely to the responders of this notice.  A subsequent presolicitation notice will not be issued.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<CONTACT>Laureli Mazik, Contracting Officer, Phone (719) 556-9631, Email laureli.mazik@cisf.af.mil - Cheryl McGuire, Contract Manager, Phone (719) 556-9631, Email cheryl.mcguire@cisf.af.mil
<DESC>SMC/LGKM, located at Peterson AFB, CO, is contemplating negotiating a twenty-four (24) month, approximately $800K, contract extension on a non-competitive basis with ITT Industries, Systems Division, for continued support and deactivation of the Single Channel Transponder Injection Subsystem (SCITS) & ICBM SHF Satellite Terminal (ISST).  The current contract, F04701-00-D-0502, set to expire 17 Aug 05, will be extended to 17 Aug 07 for continued support of services, which include operational problem resolution, configuration control, engineering change proposal preparation, technical data and related engineering, technical and program management, and deactivation activities.  Deactivation of the program will begin on or about Jan 07.  The SCTIS is comprised of the Command Post Equipment, which is used for the Command and Control, and the Terminal Equipment, which performs signal processing. There are four, fixed operational SCTIS sites world-wide and two sites that are used for operational test and maintenance. SCTIS transmitters are used by command and control centers to send messages to appropriately configured strategic forces, mainly launch control centers and bombers.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff depends on the ISST to deliver emergency actions messages to Air Force missile crews.  To ensure national defense, the terminals must remain on-line, fully functional and High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse protected 24 hours a day.  Using the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C)(1), pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), SMC anticipates that this effort will be available only from the original source.  Place of performance is at contractor's facility and site locations.  ITT Industries continues to have the proprietary rights to data necessary to support the systems. Accordingly, any other interested source would have to obtain license from ITT Industries.  SCTIS/ISST unique resources (facilities, test equipment, technical data, computer Systems, etc.) used to support the systems are the same resources required to provide post-production support.  Also, those required assets would have to be duplicated in order for a competitor to perform at an acceptable level.  The expense of duplicating unique resources alone is substantially greater than the price of the two-year contract extension, especially considering that deactivation of the program is expected to begin on or about Jan 07.  As the sole producer of these systems, ITT Industries is the only contractor possessing the proprietary data, the technical expertise, the equipment, and the documentation required for this sustaining effort. However, interested parties must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) within 10 days of this announcement demonstrating proven SCITS/ISST logistics capability, program experience, knowledge, and that continuity and program success will not be compromised.   The SOC shall not exceed 10 one-sided pages in length. Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 98 or higher or, PDF Format.  All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point. Verbal responses will not be accepted.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute a RFP.  A solicitation for this contract extension may or may not be established. Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with the submission of an SOC. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether any prospective credible source other then the incumbent exists.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710 (1000 employees). Submit all responses to synopsis to: SMC/LGKM, Attn Laureli Mazik, 1050 E Stewart Ave, Peterson AFB, CO  80914-2902 (e-mail: laureli.mazik@cisf.af.mil).  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  The Ombudsman can be contacted at SMC/DS (310) 336-3571.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) for clear view silica fused re-entrant windows capable of allowing manipulation and detection of atoms in a vacuum chamber.

Sole source determination is based on UKAEA’s experience in developing sizeable windows that allow sufficient magnetic field development.  UKAEA is the sole source manufacturer and provider of 5” clear view windows. Furthermore, purchase of a different size window would not allow for placement of coils necessary for trapping atoms and in some cases limit the scope of our research.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 327212, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the government will consider responses received by June 6, 2005.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposal acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>US Department of Commerce/ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-intends to negotiate with MapInfo Corporation, on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) only one responsible source.  The acquisition is to complete, install, integrate, debug and support software upgrades for the International Trade Administration’s TradeStats Express™, a Web-based GIS data dissemination and analysis system.  The period of performance will be for 4 months under simplified acquisition procedures.  MapInfo Corporation is the only vendor at this time capable of immediately supplying ITA with the full range of services required to complete unfinished development tasks and maintain stable system operations.  The TradeStats Express is a specialized application — not COTS — built on a version of MapInfo’s MapXtreme platform.  MapInfo engineering team can make modifications to MapXtreme’s proprietary source code, which is periodically necessary to achieve the system functionality required by ITA.  MapInfo has the sole capability to modify source code and has unique expertise regarding the architecture, coding, and support requirements of the TradeStats Express application.  MapInfo has been the developer of the application from the project’s inception in 2000, and the firm has hands-on experience with the system.  This experience has repeatedly been critical in applying fixes, work-arounds, and code enhancements to meet the project timeline.  MapInfo has the necessary familiarity with the ongoing transition of the application to TradeStats Express Version 2™, which is based on the .NET platform.  MapInfo is familiar with the complex support tools which they have developed for the TradeStats Express over the past three years.  These specialized tools speed data loading, diagnose problems, maximize security, and optimize system performance and configuration. The TradeStats Express application is a unique combination of custom application software (TradeStats Express application code and a specially-modified build of MapXtreme), the operating environment (Windows 2003 Advanced Server), and hardware (two specially configured multiprocessor Intel-based servers). Given the customized nature of the application software, the complex integration of application code with underlying proprietary code for the MapXtreme application, the presence of application-specific hardware configuration issues, and the specialized requirements for system maintenance, it maybe unlikely for another contractor to assume responsibility for the system without major delays and extreme high risks to the sustained operation of the TradeStats Express — a mission-critical application for the International Trade Administration.  The contractor shall provide the services requested in accordance with the attached statement of work.

If an offeror is certain they can meet the requirements, they are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response with a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15-days after publication of this synopsis.  All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the attention of Jay Parsick, Contract Specialist.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The announcement is amended to update and clarify the requirement as announced and to make certain minor corrections.  Specifically, the Government, rather than the contractor, will create the shopping list previously discussed; data from health food stores may not be available at an acceptable cost; the requirement is removed for special market reports as needed; the acquisition likely will NOT be incrementally funded; and a single database must be created by the contractor and delivered, because compilations of existing databases are not adequate to fulfill this program need.  The RFP release and proposal due dates are not changed. The text of the announcement is hereby restated to read as follows:  The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a requirement for the Food Label and Package Survey (FLAPS).  A contractor is sought to provide a single, computerized marketing database that contains annual dollars sales, units sales, and product descriptors (nutrient content claims) at the product class, brand, and item level of processed, packaged foods and dietary supplements from supermarkets, drug stores, and mass merchandisers.  In addition, data from health food stores and other sources of dietary supplements are desired if available.  The database shall be representative of the US food and dietary supplement market.  Subsequently, the successful contractor shall purchase a portion of approximately 1300 food products for the FLAPS sample.  A single cost-reimbursement contract award is anticipated for eighteen (18) months. The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available on or about 15 days from the date of appearance of the original announcement, with a proposal due date thirty (30) days after the RFP release.  The RFP will be made available at the single government point of entry, FedBizOpps or www.eps.gov, only; hardcopies will not be provided.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal in accordance with the RFP instructions for consideration by the Government. This announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD AT http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Proposal due date remains 27-May-2005, close-of-business.  The project will consist of preparation of a suitable seedbed, seed native and non-invasive vegetation, control noxious weeds and irrigate until the plants are well established.  After establishment of native and non-invasive plant species is achieved (2 years) the water rights will be removed.  Irrigation water will be temporarily transferred by the Navy to the 300-acre buffer zone until native plant species are established.  Native and non-invasive plant communities at NASF typically consist of salt desert shrubs, Four-wing Saltbush, Shadscale, Greasewood, Quailbush and perennial bunch grasses such as creeping wild rye, wheatgrass, and alkali sacaton. The precipitation average in this desert is 5 inches per year. To control the soil erosion and restore the native habitat, the weeds need to be controlled and the 300 acres replanted. This project shall convert old agricultural lands, 300 acres, to native and non-invasive vegetation. Irrigation water is available from the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District (April-November). Graded border irrigation is the method of irrigation used in this valley. This parcel was irrigated last in 1998. Re-vegetating Agricultural Outleases with native and non-invasive plant species complies with the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Management of the Greenbelt at NAS Fallon, The NAS Fallon Agricultural Outlease Land Management Plan, State of Nevada and Churchill County dust control regulations.

<DESC>************ PLEASE NOTE:   This is a modification to Space Warfare Center (SWC) "Open" Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 04-01.   “Call" SWC BAA 04-03 adds focus areas to the Space Battlelab Section.  Calls may be issued against SWC BAA 04-01 for a period of no more than five years from the date of its initial announcement.  White papers for SWC BAA 04-03 may be submitted from the date of this announcement through 22 May 06.  All terms and conditions of the previous announcement for SWC BAA 04-02 remain valid.  A complete description of SWC BAA 04-03 is identified in the attached document.  The SWC may contract for activities covered in the focus areas detailed within this document.  The intent of the BAA is to investigate and develop concepts and technologies that will enable the SWC to meet current and future Air Force warfighter space needs.  The goal is to develop technologies that provide the best possible space capabilities for the warfighters, when and where needed, in the most cost-effective manner.  White papers and subsequent proposals can cover either development of new capabilities for potential 3600 R&D acquisitions or leverage off existing capabilities for 3400 O&M acquisitions.  Please closely follow the directions in the BAA regarding submission of white papers and do not submit a formal proposal at this time.  After market research was performed, it was determined that specific funds would not be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  However, should potential white papers be accepted from those institutions, and adequate funding becomes available, proposals will be requested from them.  Direct questions to Mr. Robert Wind at (719) 567-3565 or Ms. Brenda Lewis at (719) 567-3440.

<SOLNBR>W91260RFI0003
<RESPDATE>060805
<ARCHDATE>08072005
<CONTACT>Leah Pauls, 719-554-8448
<DESC>The original RFI is modified to include answers to questions submitted during the first 10 calendar days of subject RFI. Questions and answers are published below for open review. Questions are annotated with the letter Q followed by a number. The associated answer follows with the letter A and the same number. Q1: In the Antenna Solution section there is a reference to system notes. Where are the system notes? Do these notes have minimum link budget requirements? A1: The Envisioned system (System notes) is a few categories down in the RFI. See paragraph 4 in original RFI. Q2: Is there an estimated weight limit for trailer system? A2: The weight is light weight to fit the mindset description to a highly mobile system. A fifth wheel type of equipment trailer would be too big. Q3: What is the maximum expected tracking rate? A3: TBD (LEO, Near Space, Atmospheric). Q4: Does the requirement for simultaneous operation of the wideband and narrow band links mean simultaneous operation over two different frequency bands? A4: Yes, we will be using several different bands to perform data download and command and control functions. Q5: Is the 54 Mbps minimum wideband data rate for full duplex operation, or are there different data rates required for the uplink and downlink? A5: The minimum 54 Mbps is required for the downlink. We would like to have the capability to uplink wideband data to other platforms in different frequencies but not at the 54 Mbps. Q6: What are the required interfaces between the Satellite Ground Station and the remainder of the system? A6: The interfaces should all be IPv6 compliant. Q7: Are you looking for 1 SATCOM terminal to provide simultaneous TT&C/C2 and mission datalinks to one platform asset at a time? A7:Yes, but consider multiple channels. Also acquire asset A/ disengage and focus on asset B/ reacquire asset A. Or, it might acquire and transmit to 2 assets at the same time. Q8: If not one (1) platform, what are the number of simultaneous platforms? A8: One to several, exact number TBD. Q9: Can you identify candidate theater based assets? A9: Space (i.e. TacSats), Near Space (i.e. HAAs), atmospheric (i.e. UAVs). Q10: Is the SGS strictly an Intermediate System or communications system node on the HMMWV trailer? A10: It is a mobile ground station (See answer to Q22). Q11: Will the SGS configuration also host tactical radios and co-located networking equipment? A11: Yes, and more than that. It can serve as a node or relay. Q12: Are these stations manned or unmanned for operation? A12: Manned. Q13: Are EW (AJ/LPI/D) factors of any concern to the TT&C and C2 links? A13: Yes. Q14: Will sensor downlinks via AFSCN including the Unified S Band (USB) upgrade (supports wider bandwidth downlinks) be a capability of interest? A14: Possibly. Q15: Can further clarification be provided on the wideband data rates such as an upper rate bound, or a maximum bandwidth constraint? A15: Not at this time. This ground station will satisfy a number of experimental requirements (see Q23). Q16: Can you provide specific frequency ranges in the C, X, and Ka bands of interest? A16: No, per answer above. Q17: What is the desired RF band change-over time for a terminal? A17: That is part of this RFI&as fast as possible. Q18: Can you provide nominal downlink transmitter EIRP data for each band? This will support FWCGS antenna sizing versus rate supported. A18: This will vary. Q19: Are all links to be provided to all platforms? A table correlating links to platforms would be helpful. A19: Not all platforms will require the same links. Q20: In addition to the network/communications services and applications described, does the Control System include any other tactical applications for TT&C, C2 and mission data processing/display or will external but co-located, in-field, and located else where users perform these functions? A20: Yes to both ideas.  This is to be as flexible as possible. Q21: If yes to 1, what are the applications that will need to be supported by the SGS? This data will help us size and configure processing capabilities. A21: Besides the answers to Q1, internet connectivity and data transmission are absolutely necessary. Q22: Will connectivity to co-located and in-field users also be via SATCOM or will existing LAN, SWLAN, and tactical theater nets also be applied for connectivity? What are your preferences for inclusion in the SGS for FWC? A22: SATCOM and internet, in addition to plug-in LAN/WAN. This ground station will be used for experimentation and be a test bed itself, rather than an acquisition program. However, the technological spin-off might be considered for further development bey ond the Envisioned System. Q23: Is there intent for both local and remote (over AFSCN) SGS control? A23: Yes. Q24: Can you provide limits on dynamics of platforms. For example, speed and altitude, etc. for low altitude rapidly moving platforms? A24: Space, near space, atmospheric are the three classes of platforms. Q25: Does self-contained above imply AC power generation must be mounted on the same HMMWV trailer? A25: Yes. Q26: The sources sought notice mentioned an ROM.  I take it from the balance of the text that the Army is looking for general approaches with respect to the technology in not necessarily a ROM price estimate. A26: We need a fairly reasonable estimate of costs associated with putting together the varying capabilities. We hope that all responding to this effort are aware of emerging technologies to use for modularity, to incorporate other technologies as they mat ure, i.e. the reference to the antenna. The design can be anything possible that is light-weight and highly mobile. The final thought is that this ground station must be in line with the Envisioned System description. Q27: &we currently have a baseline design into the Air Force for a AFSCN compatible Transportable. Our engineering and program development folks would be interested in briefing the Army on our approach and where the requirements may vary. As I understand i t sounds like your customer is looking for a budgetary estimate, w/ a more detailed communication on the specs. we could give a better estimate. Is your customer available for a 1 to 2 hr. meeting? A27: We cannot meet with individual vendors at this time. The ROM is a best guess for an Envisioned System solution. A28: Is there a permanent station segment as well as a mobile ground station? A28: No. The mobile station can be fixed /co-located if needed for a specific purpose. Q29 Are there any size weight limitations? A29: No. Lightweight means just that. We are not looking for big dishes and huge trailers. Q30: Using a Hummvee&  A30:Yes, as it is the current asset used by teams throughout the world. This means that it could be towable, or fully contained within a shelter. This is up to the vendor to decide. Q31: The requirement & includes 'space and near space' requirements as well as 'rapidly moving aircraft' - these statements seem to require a multitude of systems - is there any documentation or reference material that can be made available that describes the requirement in more detail so we can evaluate our capabilities in relation to your requirements? A31: Reference the desired Envisioned System description of having one multi-use ground station capability. & as long as it answers& per the RFI, will be welcomed for our review.  This is a Request for Information to identify sources interested in supplying the aforesaid system. The following information is provided for planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government as  to the ultimate acquisition approach. All interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications, capabilities, and previous experience related to fulfilling similar requirements via email to: leah.pauls@smdc-cs.army.mil 12:00 PM MST on June 6, 2005 will be considered by the Government.

Constructive simulation, virtual simulation, and capabilities analyses support services are sought for the Simulation and Analysis Facility (SIMAF) and ASC/XR. The ASC/XR Mission is effects-based planning to maximize efficiency in delivering war-winning capability. XR provides planning interfaces across the aeronautical enterprise and to MAJCOM and HQ AFMC processes. Collaborative modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS+A) is seen as a key enabler of capabilities analyses and integration as well as system-of-systems (SoS) concepts for future capabilities.  The SIMAF is a secure facility capable of operating through the full range of security classifications.  Contractor personnel will be required to have the appropriate level of clearance to meet day-to-day operational requirements.   The scope of simulation efforts within the SIMAF spans weapons systems acquisition life cycles, from conceptual to developmental phases through sustainment, and may be executed in segregated or integrated air-to-air, air- to-ground, and surface-to-air environments as specified by the government.   Typical requirements are constructive simulation studies, virtual simulation studies, human system integration studies, distributed simulation events, and support for simulation events that may include live testing or direct test.   Five support functions structured as Performance Based Services are anticipated for FY06 thru FY10. Firms may propose one (except for E below which must be proposed in concert with at least one other area), two, three, four or all functions (approximate functional percentage of total effort is shown as percentage): A)	Capabilities Development and Integration (software development) (30%)  Typical areas of software development include, but are not limited to simulation specific code, weapons SoS network architectures, interfaces and protocols; computer system network architectures, interfaces and protocols; and data analysis software.

The Material to be procured will include: Computer Hardware, Cockpit Hardware, Simulation Systems, Visual and Graphic Display Systems, Computer Networking Equipment, Communications Systems. For more detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. E)	Enterprise Capabilities Integration Process Support (5%) ASC/XR strives to leverage MS+A techniques across aeronautical enterprise processes.  Both General Support and specific Project Support efforts are anticipated under this functional area. General Enterprise support consists of  participating in Integrated Analysis Team meetings, the Aeronautical Enterprise (AE) IPT, ASC/XR Capabilities Integration Board (CIB) meetings, the Aeronautical Enterprise Steering Group (AESG), analytical planning support to I-CRRA Action Items or Objectives, Cost Estimating capabilities toolsets, architecture product (e.g. OV-1) validation, participation with OEMs thru Wright Brothers Institute (WBI), etc. Project specific efforts likely to be tasked thru task order might include participating in project System Engineering Working Group (SEWG) and other MS+A related project working group meetings,  assisting in development of project specific analysis plans to include the appropriate mix of constructive, virtual, and hardware in the loop simulations!  , etc. , assisting in development of program management plans, test plans, etc, for project specific requirements,  working with specific projects in developing Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) support plans,  assisting in planning and executing assessments of competing conceptual approaches for a specific project such as support to a government source selection. The acquisition strategy currently contemplates a 60-month effort with a three- year CORE effort incrementally funded and two one-year options and Customer Event Task Orders.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements Time and Materials  (T+M) type contract is contemplated.    The estimated level of effort for this contract is approximately 55,000 labor hours for the first year, increasing by 10 percent per year thereafter for a total three year CORE effort of approximately 180,000 labor hours. The two option years have an estimated 65,000 labor hours each. Customer events will be supported using task orders.   Collaborative analysis involves significant challenges in protection of intellectual property and classified information. Associate contractor Agreement clauses will be utilized in each functional area contract that XR awards. An Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause 5352.209-9002 is anticipated to be necessary to emphasize the restrictions that will be levied upon recipients due to the need to protect Proprietary Information and Intellectual Property of other contractors. Individual employees will be required to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).   A Top Secret facility/personnel security level will be required.  Top Secret clearances will be required for 50% of the staff at time of contract award.   All personnel must be capable of receiving a Top Secret clearance, although they are not expected to be necessary for everyone at this time.  All personnel will be required to hold a Secret clearance.  Foreign firms should be aware that restrictions apply which could preclude their receipt of any resulting contract.  ITAR restrictions apply in performance of these contracts.  To determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award, foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or technical point of contact before submitting an SOC.  Submit only unclassified information for consideration and evaluation.  Statements of Capabilities (SOC) Organizations having capabilities in military operations research Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (MS+A), computer simulation requirements definition, exercise and test planning and implementation in a simulated environment, and scenario generation for large scale distributed simulations are invited to submit a SOC by 17 Jun 2005 for consideration. Firms having the capability to perform one or more functions A - D (or E with one of the above) are invited to submit a statement of capability (SOC) in order for the Government to determine the appropriate small businesses strategy.  Based on the results of the SOC evaluation, the Government reserves the right to set aside one or more functions of this requirement for small businesses or to develop innovative small business goals or arrangements.  Offerors shall indicate whether they are/are not a small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), hub-zone certified, woman-owned, service disabled veteran owned, veteran owned!  , or Historically Black College/University and against which function(s) they are submitting their SOC, and if your interest is as a prime contractor or as a  subcontractor.     The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the offerors capabilities to perform in the specified five critical support functions.  For each functional area (and the associated addendum) to which you plan to respond, please answer the following questions.   1.	What is your experience in this functional area (as described in this  announcement and in the Appendix)?  Please include detailed examples, duration and scope of relevant past work, including names and phone numbers of POCs.   2.	List whatever standard business practices (ISO 9000, CMMI, etc.) to  which you adhere.  Include certification date, method, and level.  3.	Indicate your business size and category and if responding as a  potential prime contractor or sub-contractor. Provide specific examples of your firms capabilities to meet facility/personnel security, ITAR requirements, and to comply with the OCI and ACA restrictions. Sample study scenario may be provided at a later date for your consideration.   Please check the PIXS site for updates. All interested firms are requested to submit their SOC plus any sample study scenarios responses (original plus 2 copies) by 17 Jun 2005, substantiating each qualification described above.  The SOC shall be limited to a maximum of five pages per function. Pages allowed for any sample study scenario responses will be specified when posted to PIXS. Font size for the SOC is no smaller than 10 pt Times New Roman. Submit SOC to ASC/XRS, Attn:  Ms. Patricia Krabacher, 2275 D Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, 45433-7224.  Any responses received not clearly indicating which of the five function support areas the respondent is a potential source for (or which fail to meet the page limitation) may not be considered.  Submit only unclassified information for consideration and evaluation. Potential offerors responding to this sources sought synopsis must indicate whether they qualify as a small business under NAICS Code 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  An organizational conflict of interest clause AFMC FAR Clause 5352.209-9002(Tailored), Organizational Conflict of Interest (Aug 2002)is anticipated in any resultant contract which is likely to restrict OEMs from providing proposals for follow-on efforts.  Additional background information may be loaded in the PIXS library for XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services at  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/default.asp  .

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541110 THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This Sources Sought is in support of market research being conducted by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) to identify capable potential sources interested in providing services for the “Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Confidentiality Advice and Services”.  

This Sources Sought is in support of market research being conducted by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) to identify capable potential sources interested in providing services for the “Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Confidentiality Advice and Services”.  

The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) Office of Chief Counsel requires professional services related to the processing and resolution of requests for confidentiality received by the agency. Specially, the Contractor will be required to review documents and produce draft responses to confidentiality requests that are consistent with law and agency’s regulation on confidentiality.

Requirements
The Contractor is required to perform all work necessary to evaluate the sufficiency of each confidentiality request in accordance with 49 CFR Part 512 (a copy of the regulation is provided in the Appendix) and the FOIA and produce a draft response.  Successful Contractor performance includes producing timely and effective responses to confidentiality requests and a consistently high-value work product.  Contractors must also have a demonstrated ability to review documents in a quick manner and determine whether their release would result in substantial competitive harm to the requester.  The agency anticipates the need for one on-site specialist for a period of 12 months to assist in clearing the confidentiality request backlog the agency currently faces.

The agency’s current backlog averages around 100 unprocessed requests. Confidentiality requests can be divided into two levels of efforts.  Approximately 95% of the requests will require review of a limited amount of material consisting of less than a few hundred pages of materials.  The review of this material and drafting a response to the request averages around 1-5 labor hours.  Approximately 5% of the requests consist of multiple boxes of material and thousands of pages of documents.  The amount of documents involved makes the review and response sufficiently complex to warrant additional time in responding.  Due to the varying sizes of these requests, the agency plans to work with the Contractor to establish specific deadlines for this type of work.    

Contractor personnel providing professional services under this contract shall be fully qualified to provide high quality advice and services in all of the subject areas described above.  Each Contractor employee providing professional services under this contract must also have prior experience, for a minimum of one year, in addressing issues of confidentiality under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for a federal agency at a professional level comparable to that called for in this solicitation.  Each Contractor employee shall also have a basic understanding of competitive concerns in a regulated industry such as the automotive industry.

All submitted information should be limited to no more than 15 pages, one-sided, minimum font size 10 and should be sent to Lamont O. Norwood, Small Business Specialist, via e-mail at lamont.norwood@nhtsa.dot.gov  by xx May  2005 no later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time. A responder may request clarification in writing for any requirement that is unclear from Lamont O. Norwood, Small Business Specialist Contracting Officer, at (202) 366-8573 or by sending an e-mail tolamont.norwood@nhtsa.dot.gov <mailto:lamont.norwood@nhtsa.dot.gov>. Any requests for clarification must be received no later than three (3) business days prior to the close of this sources sought announcement in order to receive a timely response. 

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All routine communications regarding this announcement should be directed to the contractual points of contact listed above. All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency.

It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Requirement is for hotel accommodations for 500 rooms during USSOCOM International SOF week, 5-11 June 2005. Security issues, time constraint and the highly sensitive nature of the conference are key factors in this requirement. The Hyatt Regency was selected to be in the best interest of the Government due to the close proximity to MacDill AFB for military personnel traveling to the conference site daily and for it’s location for conference attendees that will not have proper transportation.  This agency intends to award to Hyatt Regency 211 North Tampa Street Tampa, FL 33602.

<SUBJECT>70 -- ClearPath mainframe upgrade
<DESC>This serves as a “Notice of Intent” to award a sole source task order for Clearpath mainframe system upgrades to Unisys, Inc. under the NASA SEWP contract, pursuant to FAR 16.5 (exception to Fair Opportunity).  The General Services Administration Federal Supply Service (FSS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has a requirement for upgrades to their Unisys Clearpath mainframe systems.  The Unisys ClearPath hardware and software are proprietary to and only available through Unisys Corporation.  No other hardware and software will be compatible with the Unisys environment.  It is essential that all hardware and software which supports the FSS applications be certified to support ClearPath systems and that they be installed in a manner which supports the ClearPath.  The substantial improvement of continuity of operations of this critical computing environment is closely aligned with the identified goal of FSS to provide system uptime in excess of 99 percent.  The purchase of the upgrades will allow FSS to meet these uptime goals in the face of disaster of the primary ClearPath system in Eagan MN, by activating a synchronized replicate in Salt Lake City UT.  This requirement is proprietary to Unisys.  Because the requirement entails an integrated mainframe upgrade solution, purchase of individual components from authorized resellers is not feasible, economical, or recommended.  There would be no savings realized by purchasing each item separately, as this mainframe environment dictates a custom, bundled solution.  Conversion of the existing applications to a different operating environment would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirements and mission of FSS OCIO.  This Determination and Findings authorizing use of an exception to Fair Opportunity is in accordance with FAR 16.5, based on the above.  All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 202-329-7250, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.

<SUBJECT>C -- Architect/Engineer Design Services
<DESC>Robert S. Vance Federal Building and Courthouse
Birmingham, Alabama, Proposed Renovation & Alterations Construction, Design Phase

Networking Session

On Tuesday, June 7, 2005, The United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct a Networking Session for Small and Large Business Architect/Engineer firms which may be interested in exploring teaming opportunities with the selected Short-Listed Lead Design A/E firms on the design phase of the renovation of the Vance FB / Courthouse in Birmingham, Alabama.  The Networking Session will be conducted from 6 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at The Vance Federal Building/Courthouse, 1800 Fifth Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama.  Signage will be posted at the Building entrance directing all attendees to the selected meeting area.

The facility to be renovated will consist of 174,000 gross square feet and will provide space for The U.S. District Court, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court with associated chambers and the Bankruptcy Clerks Office.  Space will also be included for the U.S. Marshal Service, the U.S. Attorney,  the U.S. Probation, GSA and other Federal Agencies.  There will be a maximum of 39 outside parking spaces.  The Courthouse is located within the Central Business District of Birmingham, Alabama.

The Estimated Construction Cost (ECC) is between $12,000,000 and $15,000,000 and most, if not all, design and construction disciplines are expected to be represented.  The Short-Listed Lead Design A/E firms desire to discuss teaming opportunities with qualified A/E firms to meet the GSA requirement that a minimum of 35% of the level of contract effort be performed in the State of Alabama.  These firms must have an active production office established within the State of Alabama within 90 days prior to March 7, 2005.

The Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA’s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and is committed to opening a dialogue between qualified Architect/Engineer Firms in the community and State who may desire to become a part of the project with the Design Teams.

Large and Small Business Architect/Engineer firms will be given an opportunity to meet the GSA Project Team and representatives from each of the Short Listed Lead Design A/E firms, listen to a GSA presentation on the scope of the project, and to participate in question and answer session.  It is expected that at the conclusion of the Networking Session participants will be a better position to determine whether or not to further pursue teaming opportunities for this project.

Questions about the Vance Networking Session should directed to  David Gibson, GSA’s Small Business Advocate for The Public Buildings Service in The Southeast Sunbelt Region (404) 331-2366, E-Mail DavidA.Gibson@GSA>GOV.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to negotiate a sole source contract with the University of Washington, Aquatic & Fisheries Science for NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to participate in the Willamette-Lower Columbia and Interior Columbia River, Technical Recovery Teams (TRT)
Background and Objective. Provide scientific and technical support to NMFS for the management, conservation, and wise use of the Northwest region's marine and anadromous resources. 
 The Willamette-Lower Columbia and Interior Columbia Technical Recovery Teams (TRTs) are multi-stakeholder groups created by NMFS in 2000 to conduct technical analyses and develop biologically based delisting criteria for Ecologically Significant Units (ESU) listed under the Endangered Species Act. The TRTs work with state, tribal and local government scientists to amass data, conduct analyses, and draw biological conclusions about the status and desired future condition of listed salmonid ESUs.  Much of the development and support of technical analyses used by the TRTs is conducted by staff at the NWFSC. The NWFSC and TRT’s are developing analytical approaches to answering questions related to quantifying the present status of populations, describing biologically based ESU recovery goals, and technical approaches suggesting which actions are sufficient for achieving recovery.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6 Commercial Items as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     HSFE04-05-RQ-4787  is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).     The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03.  This procurment is a small business set-aside.  The NAICS Code applicable to this RFQ is 336120; small business size standard is 500 employees. The Department of Homeland Security/FEMA proposes to purchase nine (9)Container Sidelifters to be able to perform the following tasks and to meet specifications below.
•	Pick-up and unload on any even or uneven surface
•	Handle any container size from 20 to 40 feet
•	Movable Cranes or Cranes Mounted on Telescoping 20/40 trailer to handle 20 and 40 foot containers using  the short (compressed) trailer for 20’ containers and the long (extended) trailer configuration only for 40’ containers.
•	Trailer must be equipped with air ride suspension, dump valve and 9’1’’ axle spread. 
•	Cranes mounted to trailer in fixed location within 48’’ of the rear of the trailer for best reaching and setting containers in tight confined areas.
•	Intermodal transfers between road and rail (Unloading from road to flat rail cars or vice versa).
•	Trailer to Trailer loading capability with OVERDECK leg stabilizers for maximum stability and no stabilizer leg interference between Side-loader and trailer, chassis or rail car being transferred to and from.
•	Low profile cranes to allow for over-the-road clearances.
•	Double stacking of empty or fully loaded containers, even in confined spaces. 
•	Meet all Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications and standards.

SPECIFICATIONS:

•	Maximum capacity:  35 metric tons (77,000lbs)
•	Container handling capability: 20’ – 40’
•	Extendible trailer chassis to handle 20’ and 40’ containers.
•	Self contained power source for hydraulic and electrical system.
•	Proportional cable remote operation.
•	Crane reach capability to lift to and from another trailer, chassis or rail car and stack containers two high with one on the ground.

•	Delivery time should not exceed 90 days after contract date.

<DESC>SCOPE OF WORK

“DEFINITIONAL MISSION” FOR ADVISORY AND ASSISTANCE SERVICES BY NON-GOVERNMENTAL SOURCES FOR HAWAII, INDIA, INDONESIA, SRI LANKA, AND THAILAND.”

PROJECT TITLE:  HAWAII, INDIA, INDONESIA, SRI LANKA, AND THAILAND: EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS DEFINITIONAL MISSION

1		SCOPE OF WORK

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for proposed study, technical assistance or other trade capacity building activity(ies) herein after referred to as “study(ies)”;

1.3		assess any alternative study or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA/U.S. Government consideration;  

1.4	evaluate a minimum of two studies in each country to recommend for USTDA funding; and

1.5	provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues. 

2  		DELIVERY & PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

2.1		KICK-OFF MEETING WITH THE USTDA PROGRAM OFFICE

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).    
 
2.2		PRE-VISIT REPORT (3-5 PAGES)

Prior to departure to the host countries, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on viability of the project(s), financing options, U.S. company interest in the project (s), a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  The Contractor shall consult with USAID, NOAA, DHS-FEMA, U.S. Geological Survey, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the U.S. private sector to discuss potential projects and funding.
    
2.3		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host countries of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4	CONTRACTOR’S RESPONSIBILITY AND BACKGROUND

		USTDA has approved up to $90,000 for a Definitional Mission (DM) to Hawaii, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand to review potential technical assistance, feasibility studies, and other activities related to emergency communication systems and an integrated communications backbone for disaster mitigation and risk management.  

                        Communication links have always been a critical component of disaster response, reduction and relief.  The tragic events in South and Southeast Asia, resulting from the earthquake and tsunami in December 2004, are the most recent example.  During Ambassador Howard H. Baker Jr.’s address at the January 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe, Japan, he asserted that the United States Government is committed to strengthening the world’s ability to reduce risk from hazards in order to prevent those risks from turning into disasters.  This includes warning systems that alert the public about all major hazards and that communicate warning messages via all available notification technologies.  

                        The support of early warning systems and backbone communications projects in India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand promotes economic development through the improvement of each country’s emergency communications infrastructure, productivity improvement, and disaster mitigation technology transfer.  The United States is one of the most advanced nations in the field of information communication technologies, and U.S. companies are well-represented and particularly active through USAID and development-bank financed projects in South and Southeast Asia.  

	                        The goal of public warning is to reduce the damage and loss of life caused by a natural or man-made hazardous event because people that are properly alerted will be better able to respond to the emergency.  To assure that everyone can be alerted, it is essential to leverage all available communications media as appropriate, including broadcast or individual targeting.  The content of alert messages is now being standardized across all hazard types, including severe weather, fires, earthquakes and tsunami.  Operational systems based on international standards have shown that a single authoritative and secure alert message can quickly launch Internet messages, news feeds, television text captions, highway sign messages and synthesized voice over automated telephone calls or radio broadcasts.  

	                        Appropriate communications systems and coordination among local authorities are two key components of effective disaster early warning systems.  Technical assistance is needed to define a system for India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Maldives that will provide a suitable means for warning reception, warning dissemination, and community preparedness.  Capacity enhancement for disaster risk management is needed, including communications infrastructure development.  A successful system in these countries should also be able to be subsequently replicated in other countries in the region. 

                        This DM shall evaluate projects to help Indian Ocean countries prepare for natural disasters and other hazards.  This work will contribute to a better communications system that will allow governments and local entities in Indian Ocean countries to better communicate and to respond to emergencies.   A key goal is to promote the development of effective response capabilities to a range of natural and man-caused disasters and emergencies.  Another goal related to warning systems is the promotion of interoperability of the various national systems as a regional approach emerges.  

                        While many donor countries and international organizations are providing technical and capacity building assistance in this area, this USTDA-funded DM will focus on command and control and backbone infrastructure for emergency communication systems.  The Contractor shall evaluate possible technical assistance support for early warning systems as well.  The Contractor must consult and coordinate assistance plans with NOAA, USGS, DHS-FEMA, USAID, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and others.  

                                    USTDA June 6-10 Asia-Pacific All Hazards Workshop will be an excellent opportunity to meet key officials from both the U.S. Government and the South and Southeast Asia region to gather information and ideas.  USTDA will consider projects that leverage other donor assistance.  In addition, USTDA will place priority on leveraging U.S. private sector contributions and support for projects that have a mutual economic benefit.     

2.5		CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL 

The Contractor shall travel to the host countries no later than July 2005 to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.  The Contractor shall spend at least 3-4 business days each in India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand.  While a visit to the Maldives is not required, the Contractor shall be responsible for reviewing and considering assistance for that country.  The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Economic Section at the U.S. Embassy in each country upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report.

The Contractor shall also participate in USTDA’s June 6-10, 2005 Asia-Pacific All Hazards Workshop in Hawaii for a minimum of 3 days. 

2.6		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall consult with USAID, NOAA, DHS-FEMA, U.S. Geological Survey, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the U.S. private sector to discuss potential projects and funding.  The Contractor shall investigate projects related to command and control, backbone systems and emergency communications technology solutions, among others.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project and any related impacts on trade capacity building in each host country.

2.7		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.7.1		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.7.1.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a study of the proposed project(s); 

2.7.1.2 	 assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.7.1.3            provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues

2.7.1.4        evaluate all studies in the context of the overall assistance package

2.7.2		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.7.2.1 	be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.7.2.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.7.2.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.7.2.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing market entry problems and/or strong competition from foreign companies, which often receive subsidies, and other support from their governments.

As part of this review, the Contractor is required to contact officials from the potential financing institutions, including, where appropriate, multilateral lending institutions, Ex-Im Bank, OPIC, and private/commercial sources, to assure that the project sponsors have adequately explored their financing options.  The Contractor shall provide names and phone numbers of contacts at the potential lending institutions and summarize their comments.  The Contractor must determine the most likely source(s) of implementation financing and ensure that the terms of reference for any proposed study fulfill the requirements of the most likely source(s), or suggest appropriate revisions to ensure that they do.  

3.5		U.S. EXPORT POTENTIAL (1-2 PAGES)

The Contractor shall submit a best estimate of potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation.
