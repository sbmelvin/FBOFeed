<DESC>The Department of Commerce/NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Center for Coastal Studies for follow-on large whale disentanglement services.  Several species of endangered marine mammals are subject to entanglement in active and derelict commercial fishing gear.  The endangered species of most concern in the northeast region of the United States is the northern right whale.  The minimum population estimate upon which management actions are currently based is 300 animals for the Western North Atlantic stock of the northern right whale population.  Scaring patterns on known individual right whales indicate that a minimum of 72% of the remaining population exhibit signs of entanglement in fishing gear.  A second species of concern is the humpback whale.  Entanglement for these whales is the most prevalent human-induced take observed in the Northeast.  It is estimated that 50% of the humpback whales of the Gulf of Maine sub-stock bear scars from entanglements.  Disentanglement of a live whale from fishing gear is an extremely dangerous operation that may result in injury to the whale and those attempting to free it.  The goal of the National Marine Fisheries Service is to maintain a team of experts to respond to marine mammal entanglements and prevent entanglements from becoming fatal. The anticipated contract performance period is for one year plus zero option years.  The statutory authority for this action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Fiscal year 2005 funds have been directed by Congress to the Center for Coastal Studies.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710.  The size standard is 500 employees.  No award shall be made based on responses to this announcement as this is not a request for proposals.  Numbered note 11 applies.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Cape Cod Commercial Hook Fisherman's Association for the implementation of the ACCSP 2005 Electronic Vessel Reporting Pilot Project.  Currently, all miltispecies permitted fishing vessels are required to report catch and related data using paper Vessel Trip Reports (VTRs).   Amendment 13 to the fishing regulation has sharply increased the number and precision of monitoring requirements by implementing several small Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for stock areas of species of concern, and implementing a new Days-At-Sea (DAS) regime.  TACs require greater timelines in monitoring amounts caught to allow for the same forecast precision as a large TAC.  NMFS requires a coordinated system that provides both timely vessel and dealer information.  The contractor shall test replacing the current paper-based vessel reporting system with an electronic system to demonstrate improved fishery management by linking vessel reports to Dealer Electronic Reporting (DER) in a coordinated system.  The statutory authority for this proposed action is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(3), Only One Responsible Source.  Cape Cod Commercial Hook Fisherman's Association is uniquely as the only local organization with current applications and capabilities to perform the pilot project.  The applicable NAICS code is 541690.  The size standard is $6 million.  This proposed action is anticipated to be below the simplified acquisition threshold of $100 thousand.  No award shall be made based on any response to this announcement as this is not a request for quotations.

<DESC>1.  The 37th Contracting Squadron, Lackland AFB TX, has a requirement to provide chapel music services in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW).  This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as request for quotation (RFQ) number FA3047-06-TC050.  The performance period is 01 October 2005 through 30 September 2006, with 4 one-year option periods.  This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.  The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the best value to the government.  Award is contingent upon availability of funds.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05 and DFARS Change Notice 20050901.  The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 711130; size standard $6,000,000.00.

2.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, are applicable to this solicitation.  Interested parties may submit a written quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1 and the attached CLIN structure.  Oral quotes will not be accepted.

3.  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Addendum:  Basis for Award:  This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures.  For proposals determined technically acceptable, a tradeoff between price and past performance will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price.  Offers shall propose on all items.  Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated.  An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.  Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will not be considered in the performance/price trade-off and will be ineligible for award. 

4.  The evaluation process will proceed as follows:  (a) Technical Acceptance:  By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the terms, conditions, and requirements of this solicitation and subsequent contract, and will be determined technically acceptable.  Any exception taken to the terms, conditions, or requirements will result in a determination of technical unacceptability; (b) Price:  Initially, all technically acceptable offers will be ranked according to price, including option prices.  Price will be evaluated for reasonableness and realism subject to the processes described in paragraph 8.  Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, if applicable.  Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished; (c) Past Performance:  Using questionnaires, the contracting officer will seek relevant and recent performance information on all technically acceptable offers based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Recency:  To be considered recent, a contract shall have been performed during the past three years from the date of issuance of this posting.  Relevancy:  Relevant performance includes performance of work efforts that is similar or greater in scope and magnitude.  Magnitude consists of the contractor's ability to provide a variety of music for multi-faith groups.  The following varying degrees of relevancy apply to this solicitation: Very Relevant:  Past/present performance effort involves providing/managing musical support services to military chapel program of the same or similar size, complexity, magnitude, and diversity of faiths as that outlined in the solicitation.  Relevant:  Past/present performance effort involves providing/managing musical support services to smaller  military chapel program or a large non-military religious congregation with average attendance of 500 or more persons per week for all services combined.  Somewhat Relevant:  Past/present performance effort involves involves providing/managing musical support services to a smaller religious non-military congregation with average attendance of less than 500 persons per week for all services combined.  Not Relevant:  Past/present performance effort involves providing/managing musical performances of a secular or non-religious nature.  More relevant past/present performance will receive greater weight than less relevant performance in assigning an overall confidence rating.  Offerors shall submit a minimum of 3 references, but no more than 5 overall of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers.  The offeror shall provide the attached past performance questionnaire to the reference and bear responsibility for ensuring that the reference provides the completed questionnaire to the point of contact identified in paragraph 11 of this posting by the deadline for offer submission.  Questionnaires submitted prior to the deadline for offer submission will be accepted.  The reference list should include, as a minimum: Contract Number, Description of Contract/Project Effort, Period of Performance, Contract Dollar Value, Name, Title, Current Address and Telephone Number of Contracting Officer and Quality Assurance Evaluator/Project Manager.

5.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.  The agency will evaluate past performance in accordance with the criteria in paragraphs 4(c) through 8 of this solicitation.  The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions.  The confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.  A trade-off process is then conducted.  The lowest price may not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest past performance rating may not necessarily receive the award.  A performance/price trade-off evaluation will not be conducted if only one acceptable offeror is received.  In this event, award will be made to the only technically acceptable quote received.  

6.  Overall confidence ratings are defined as follows: High Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has high confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Significant Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable. Little Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

7.  Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant and recent experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.  Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history will receive a neutral rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.  However, a rating other than neutral may be assessed if the offeror proposes management personnel who have a record of performance on relevant contracts, or if a proposed subcontractor or partner who will be performing a significant portion of the work has a performance history on relevant contracts.  When relevant performance information indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.  The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.  The offeror may be notified of any adverse past performance information and given the opportunity to respond. 

8.  If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and realistic, and is judged to have an overall high performance confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.  Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.  If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is not rated high confidence in the performance assessment, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable and realistic is rated high confidence overall for past performance.  An integrated assessment will then be performed on all technically acceptable offerors whose past performance and price were evaluated, and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.  If no proposals are rated high confidence in the performance assessments, an integrated analysis will be accomplished on all technically acceptable proposals and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.

9.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of very good or lower.  (2) If discussions will be conducted, all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.  The contracting officer will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest price offeror if that lowest priced offeror.  The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.

<DESC>TECHNICAL AND ENGINEERING ACQUISITION SUPPORT (TEAS V):  Reference Sources Sought Notice posted 2 May 2005, the acquisition strategy for the TEAS V acquisition has been determined.  After considering the integrally related nature of TEAS Program engineering support tasks and objectives across the full spectrum of TEAS customers and throughout the weapon engineering life cycle from the concept and technology through development and sustainment with testing at every stage, the acquisition strategy is to award a single contract using Full and Open competition, with North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541710 (small business size standard for the TEAS V acquisition is defined as one with <1,000 average “number of employees”, as the term is defined by FAR 19.101).  This is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) task ordering contract with approximately 126 task orders in the initial ordering period.  The Government intends to award a basic contract with four option periods.  Projected contract award date is mid April 2006 with a transition period to the task ordering period of performance which is 11 June 2006 to 30 September 2007.  A Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) was posted 16 September 2005 on FedBizOpps.  Formal RFP release is tentatively scheduled for 7 Oct 2005.  The contract will include a 31% small business subcontracting requirement.  This 31% small business subcontracting requirement in a manner that includes at least 60% of total small business labor hours being allocated to Members of Technical Staff and includes at least 10% (cumulative) of total small business labor hours being allocated to Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HubZone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business and Women-Owned Small Business concerns.  The small business subcontracting requirement escalates by one percent (1%) with the exercise of each subsequent option period (i.e., 32% for option period 1; 33% for option period two; 34% for option period 3; and 35% for option period four.)  The contract type is cost-plus-award-fee and cost-reimbursement (with no-fee).  Cost reimbursement (no-fee) line items are included for travel, relocation expenses, other direct costs, OCONUS mission essential salary/logistics support privileges/incentive, furniture, office equipment and other related items, and if necessary, off-base facility. 
The Air Force Air Armament Center (AAC) at Eglin AFB [AAC/ENR (PKZA)] will be holding a Pre-Solicitation Conference (i.e., Industry Day) for prospective TEAS V offerors on 22 September 2005 from 0800-1100.  Conference location is Bob Hope Village, 30 Holly Avenue, Shalimar, FL 32579.  Check-in and registration will take place inside the Ballroom at 0740 - 0800.  All interested companies are invited to attend the conference and provide feedback on the TEAS V acquisition strategy/draft solicitation.  (Reference Industry Day and One-on-One Session Registration posting on FedBizOpps, which includes directions to Bob Hope Village and a question request form).  The attendee list for the Pre-Solicitation Conference and questions and answers will be posted on FedBizOpps for all interested parties.  
Interested parties are encouraged to submit questions relative to the TEAS V acquisition prior to release of the formal Request for Proposal (RFP).  All questions/comments thereafter must be submitted only to the Contracting Officer.  All questions and answers will be posted on FedBizOpps and should be sent to both Dana Sillars, Contracting Officer with a cc to Carl Ledford, Contract Specialist, via email (sensitive/proprietary information will be protected).

<CONTACT>Eddie Mills, IT Specialist, Phone 256-895-5914, Fax 256-895-5898, Email eddie.mills@gsa.gov - Eddie Mills, IT Specialist, Phone 256-895-5914, Fax 256-895-5898, Email eddie.mills@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration, Federal Technology Service (GSA-FTS), on behalf of the Department of Defense High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP), is issuing this request for information to industry.  The HPCMP is considering pursuing a contract for the purchase and maintenance of workload management software (in it’s simplest form, queuing and scheduling) to support the HPCMP’s HPC Centers’ computer job management requirements.  In addition, limited direct technical services in support of customer-specific software enhancements and installations may also be pursued.  It is envisioned that the contract will provide a capability for the HPCMP beginning in mid-2007.  Software products from an incumbent contractor are currently addressing this requirement.  Currently the HPCMP is responsible for approximately 30 HPC-class systems, of varying manufacturers, distributed across 8 large computing centers with 13 of the HPC systems having over 1000 processors each.  The HPCMP web-site www.hpcmo.hpc.mil provides links to activities and resources associated with the Program.

As a part of the early stages of formulating this acquisition, the GSA is surveying potential candidates for qualified participation as well as seeking early input that will assist in formulating the architecture of the contract.  Two items of interest include:

a. The GSA is assessing the potential for using a Schedule 70 “General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, Services” contract vehicle to address this requirement.  Please indicate if candidate product(s) and services are currently available or will be available on a GSA Schedule 70 contract prior to an anticipated contract award date of April 2006.

b. The Government considers the significant scale of implementation associated with the selected product(s) coupled with the long-term commitment to the selected product, maintenance and services to be unique.  As a function of this, the HPCMP is pursuing a correspondingly unique software licensing and respective pricing model.  This is envisioned to go beyond traditional “volume discounts” to view the HPCMP requirement as a long term conglomerate of dynamically changing and growing resources versus an assembly of many pieces that incrementally change from year to year.  The GSA is seeking input from industry with respect to an industry-acceptable licensing model that can effectively address this unique environment.


Please respond back to Ms. Mona Neal by 5pm CDT 5 October 2005, addressing the above two items as well as providing any other information that might be of value in formulating the architecture of this acquisition.

This Request for Information is not a solicitation.  The Government is only seeking responses from potential interested sources.  Limit responses to 3 pages.  Responses shall be sent by e-mail to mona.neal@gsa.gov.

Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the National Stock Number, Nomenclature, Part Number and Unit Price.   NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

<DESC>Requests for Proposals (RFP) N02-CN-55023-76, entitled:  Computing Support for the Biometry Research Group (BRG).

The BRG, Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), National Cancer Institute (NCI) in interested in acquiring computer-related technical support services, primarily systems design, computer programming, system documentation, and operational support.  The resultant award will not be a contract for statistical consultation or services.  This acquisition is a recompetition of contract N02-CN-15004 awarded to Information Management Services, Inc. The computer-related support that shall be provided falls into three main categories: (1) data management activities; (2) systems design and development; and (3) statistical analysis and modeling. Data management involves keying, formatting, and editing data collected from field studies. Systems design and development entails defining technical specification requirements and developing the program language code required to implement automated solutions. Statistical analysis and modeling involves using standard software packages and developing specialized software to carry out analyses under the general guidance of the BRG personnel. Total support for any one project will often involve aspects of more than one of these activities.

Not all of the specific projects to be supported under this contract are listed or can be predicted at this time. These projects will vary in size, complexity, and duration; they range from long-term projects to special studies. These include development and maintenance of multi-institutional collaborative screening or clinical trials, biostatistical studies on various aspects of cancer using one or more data files, development of statistical and epidemiological methodology for carrying out such research projects, pilot or feasibility screening and/or prevention trials, the conduct of epidemiologic and biostatistical studies of cancer screening and cancer prevention. Some projects require computer science expertise in information retrieval and data analysis of existing data bases which can only be carried out by the design and development of specialized software; others require the application of general purpose or existing software for data organization, maintenance and analysis. Some projects require data collection expertise in a variety of medical research settings which will necessitate the development of test instruments and coding instruction manuals, and the timely editing of data using rigorous quality control procedures; other projects require the utilization of existing data collection methods and procedures. In the majority of circumstances a high level of professional and technical expertise is required since turn-around time should be rapid, complex situations must be quickly assimilated, and accurate solutions produced using state-of-the-art technology.

It is anticipated that one (1) award will be made and that this contract will be incrementally-funded with a period of performance of five (5) years, plus two option years, for a potential period of performance of seven (7) years.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 518210.  The RFP will be issued ELECTRONICALLY on or about October 5, 2005.  The RFP will be available on the Research Contracts Branch (RCB) web site at: http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/.	Click on “Current Request for Proposals.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement to develop a cost model that parametrically evaluates the program acquisition cost (i.e. design, development, testing, evaluation, and production/recurring costs) of nuclear thermal propulsion systems.  The model will be capable of accurately estimating the cost of NTP systems sized from 15,000lbf to 250,000lbf thrust using various reactor designs and fuel types.   This NTP cost model will leverage from NTP cost models previously developed for NASA/Glenn Research Center (GRC) in its development to assure the added capabilities and enhancement of the model that are the focus of this effort. The NTP cost model development will be anchored by the best historical and up to date data that is available and will be collected from industry, academia, and other government agencies thru data collection efforts and will be included as part of the cost model (database) deliverables. The model's intent is to be able to perform quick and accurate assessments of an NTP system in efforts to support design trades as well as acquisition strategy evaluations (i.e., technology demonstration using robotic precursor missions versus initial development for human-rated missions). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase these services from Pratt & Whitney/Rocketdyne, Canoga Park, California.   Competition is considered impractical based on the following reasons: 1.  P&W/Rocketdyne, under a previous contract with MSFC, was responsible for the development and delivery of the Liquid Rocket Engine Cost Model (LRECM).  As a result, they possess an in-depth understanding of propulsion database cost modeling and are therefore in an unparalleled position to understand and implement the requirements of both the Center and the Agency in the area of NTP cost collection and modeling. 2.  P&W/Rocketdyne, under a previous contract with the Glenn Research Center, was responsible for the collection and modeling of NTP data.  Utilization of this data as the foundation for further NTP cost modeling is critical in meeting the Center's needs.  As the developer of this model, P&W/Rocketdyne is in a unique position to both understand the existing database model and successfully build upon it to further develop the cost model needed for this MSFC NTP effort. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) seeks to add two labor categories and increase the maximum number of hours available under the contract in FY2006 with the Integrated Management Resources Group.  The addition of a Data Analyst and Training Specialist will support on-going auditing services and are necessitated by the assumption of several large terminated pension plans by the PBGC.  It is not practical to compete this limited service because of IMRG's familiarity with the complexities of pension plan audits, knowledge of ERISA as well as PBGC policies and procedures, and need to supervise the additional efforts.  The increase under the existing contract will ensure the continuity in the work.  This is not a request for proposal. See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The award amount is to be in the $25,000 to $50,000 range.  If there are questions concern ing this procurement, contact the Contract Administrator, Scott Britt at scott.w.britt@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>------SYNOPSIS------
The subject solicitation (Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements (SABER), Cannon AFB, NM), been cancelled in its entirety due to recent BRAC recommendations to transfer Cannon AFB to an "enclave" status, pending the identification of a new mission for the base or final closure by December 2009.  Under these conditions, we cannot estimate with any confidence at what level a SABER contract would be worth, not knowing what the future operations of the base will be.

<DESC>This solicitation is hereby modified to entend the date for submission of quotes to 0900, Thursday, 22 September, 2005.  Please find below questions (with responses) submitted by prospective Offerors.                                   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS   TO THE ART CONSERVATION REQUIREMENT 1.	Please clarify the number of required copies of the proposal to be delivered.  Please complete and return: (i) One (1) original and one (1) copy of the complete solicitation (includes Clause 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications, Pages 19-28; (ii) one (1) original and three (3) copies of separately bounded technical pro posals; and (iii) one (1) original and three copies of separately bounded price proposals. 2.	On page 50 of the proposal titled Price Proposal, what does the statement to include number and loaded labor hourly rates mean?  What is a loaded labor hourly rate? Labor categories and quantities are outlined on pages 4-12.  Loaded labor hourly rates are those which include profit, fringe benefits, etc.   3.	I would like to include documentation showing proof of fine arts insurance with my proposal.   Should I include it in the Technical Proposal and if this is the correct place does it count against the 25-page limit for information?   Also if I wanted to submit several examples of treatment proposals and reports that provide the reviewers with understanding of my professional abilities and experiences, would these reports count against the 25-page limit too?   Some of my reports with included photographic prints are 4 to 6 pages long.   I would like to include 3 or 4 report examples with my submission.   I would think that this information would be of value to the reviewers.   I do not want to go over the 25-page limit for submission limit.   Please advise! Please feel free to include documentation showing proof of fine arts insurance and examples of documentation that shows your professional abilities and experiences.  Such documents will not be counted against the 25-page limitation. 4.	On you SF1449 Continuation Sheets, the first pricing item for each year is not clear to me.  For example, in the base year:  0001 Conservation of Art Quantity 12 Unit Months you identify 10/1/05-8/30/06 for the time frame, but what are the services or t asks to be performed?  There is reference to Purchase Request Number W74R7L-5153-0001-000, but I don't seem to have anything with this number.  Does this pricing line item relate to some set of basic duties per month (such as management, scheduling, etc.),  which are over and above tasks which will be identified individually (such as the examination or treatment of a specific artwork)?  If so, what is the monthly commitment for these basic duties? The Base Year CLIN (001 Conservation of Art Quantity 12 Unit Months) depicts the unit monthly price for labor hour CLINS  (001AA and 001AB).  As for the requisition number shown, this is merely used for the Governments identification of a requirement.  Th e pricing line item is not over and above tasks that will be identified individually. 5.	Re: Item 0001 AC, Other Direct Costs.  I can provide a schedule for our typical add-on costs (some of your listed items are included in our normal hourly rate), but do not have quantities from you to get to an Estimated Cost.  Can you provide a directio n on this or shall I just identify a plug-in, best guess (which is less than 12,000.)? CLIN 001AC is Other Direct Costs.  This amount ($12,000) needs to be included in your pricing.  This amount represents how much will be permitted for such costs in the actual contract.   6.	Re:  Item 0001AD, Contract Services Accounting.  Our general business accounting is in our hourly rate.  I realize we should add something for yearly Contractor Manpower Reporting and project-specific monthly billings, etc.  Are there additional account ing requirements or services we have to provide to the Army as part of the req uested services? The Contract Services Accounting CLIN is outlined on page 48 of the Solicitation under Contractor Manpower Reporting Requirement.  Only the listed information is required.                         NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

Does this statement only refer to the labor to support the conferences or is the cost of the facility also included. It appears to me that the RFP only includes labor and travel . Answer:  Task # 7 includes labor and the facility.  The intent is to provide the venue and administrative support.   Pricing of the facility cost is at the discretion of the bidder.

<DESC>Brookhaven National Laboratory has a requirement, and is seeking, sources for a holder system is to be used in 3 JEOL electron microscopes.  It must provide nanomanipulation capabilities while the specimen is mounted and observed in the Transmission Electron Microscope. The system must accept standard 3 mm diameter TEM grids to be compatible with current samples. Nanomanipulation is required over a range of a few hundred microns at coarse resolution and at Angstrom resolution for fine positioning over at least 2 microns. The holder must have Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) capabilities to locally probe the structure of the sample under investigation. The system must be capable of collecting I-V curves of nanoscale materials in an easy and integrated with the operations fashion. A user interface that is easy to understand and operate is necessary to make this tool available to most microscope users.

Brookhaven National Laboratory has identified the Gatan Model ST1000 as compliant with its requirements.  It includes a single-tilt TEM specimen holder, fitted with in-situ STM including 3-D approach mechanism, control system, field emission module, 3 additional wires attached to TEM-STM holder, software for control and data acquisition..  The probe scanner is integrated with a 3 dimensional approach mechanism providing a very wide range of motion ( from picometer to millimeter ), to enable the probe to be positioned accurately at the region of interest indicated by TEM imaging. In addition to acquiring STM images, the probe may be used for measuring electrical properties at specific locations on the specimen. This enables, studies of the conductance of nanoscale structures, identified in the TEM.

All interested manufacturers whose products meet or exceed Brookhaven’s requirements and the capabilities of the Gatan Model ST1000 Single Tilt TEM-STM system should contact David J. Paveglio

Contracting Officer: Patricia Godwin. DESC:       The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center- Charleston (SPAWARSYSCEN- Charleston) intends to negotiate a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 with New England Wire Technologies, 130 North Main Street, Lisbon, NH 03585. The proposed action is to provide 3,400 feet of Type 6 Litzendraht (Litz) High Current Radio Frequency (RF) Transmission cable.  Litz cable is standard for use within VLF Antenna matching components, due to its unique construction and characteristics. The configuration consists of hundreds of individual strands of magnet wire woven in a specific pattern to minimize loses and maximize the flow of RF Current.  The hundreds of individual strands of wire within Litz cable are woven in a manner to minimize loses due to proximity (which are due to interaction with magnetic fields created by high current flowing in adjacent conductors) and skin effect (which is the tendency of high frequency current to flow in the outer surface of the conductor) by facilitating even distribution of current throughout the maximized surface area. New England Wire Technologies is the only known responsible source that can fulfill the mission requirement. New England Wire Technologies is a Small Business incorporated in New Hampshire. No solicitation will be made available as a result of this announcement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the individual identified below.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  Any response to this announcement is due ten (3) days from the date this notice is published.  Responses received will be evaluated.

<DESC>Request of Information (RFI) For Infrared Cueing System (ICS).... Date: 14 September 2005.... Contact: RDECOM, CERDEC, Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD), Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: AMSRD-CER-IW-EO, Jose Vergara, email: jose.g.vergara@us.army.mil.... Synopsis:  Request of Information (RFI) for Infrared Cueing System (ICS).... Description: The U.S. Army Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is soliciting White papers from qualified and interested s ources to provide an Infrared Cueing System (ICS) with minimal development, for application on board various Army ground vehicles. The purpose of the ICS is to detect the launch of the threats projectiles and missiles at significant tactical ranges with ac curacies to support countermeasure systems. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for an award of a contract, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  No basi s for a claim shall arise as a result from a response to this Sources Sought/Market Survey or Government use of information furnished. Responses to this RFI will be reviewed by the Government and may result in an invitation to submit proposals against the BAA for a 2QFY06 award& ICS is a two-year program with option for up to another additional two years. The system will provide the Warfighter with near real-time situational awareness (SA) as well as support rapid target declaration and acquisition. Specifi c program objectives include: (1) enhanced situational awareness, and (2) high confidence automatic target declaration and cueing in a battlefield clutter environment. Battlefield clutter is defined as small arms fire, weapon firings not targeted against y our platform, explosions, natural background and fires.... The Government will provide a general architecture and interface control documents defining integration requirements with other systems. A lab-prototype ICS shall be tested within twelve months, a fully-functional lab system within 18 months and platform hosted within 24 months.... The Government is asking for information on approaches to the ICS that are achievable within the approximate bounds of the cost and schedule constraints discussed above . Only those organizations or industry teams (encouraged) capable of providing the full complement of the objective capabilities should respond. The Objectives of the system are as follows:.... (1) PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS: (1.1) The ICS (sensor) shall be ca pable to provide 360 degree coverage in azimuth. State how many sensors are required to provide this coverage. State the field of view of each.... (1.2) The ICS (sensor) shall provide coverage in elevation of at least  plus or minus 55-degrees with respect  to the sensors.... (1.3) The ICS shall have the capability to detect launch of threat munitions and in-flight motor burn of the threat.... (1.4) The ICS shall be capable to declare a threat from an effective range of the weapon.... (1.5) The ICS shall be capable to classifying the type of threat. Describe methodology/ algorithm for classification. For example, various types of target discrimination techniques may be considered, including but not limited to time sampling, spectral band discrimination, spati al content and target characteristics with time The threat location error shall underline assumptions to include; atmospheric effects, internal mounting stability, threat size and aspect angle.... (1.6) The ICS shall be capable of providing sufficient Angl e of Arrival information of the threat to hand off to a tracking radar and countermeasure system. Provide the Angle of Arrival and the method of achieving it... (1.7) The ICS shall detect and declare operationally meaningful threats at survivable standoff ranges. The ICS will require a Probability of Detection (Pd), Probability of Classification (Pc) of 90 percent each& (1.8) Provide an estimate of Probability of  Declaration (Pdecl), where Pdecl is the product of multi-frame Probability of Detection, Probability of Good Pixel (the probability that the pixel of signal interest is not a dead pixel), Probability of Track Association (probability that pixel signal can  be associated with an existing track), and Probability of Discrimination (probability that existing track meets the weighted threat classification steps for declaration)&.

<DESC>ARMED FORCES RETIREMENT HOME - WASHINGTON
STATEMENT OF WORK
MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION


SECTION  1 – BACKGROUND
The United States Congress established the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) as a separate Federal Agency in 1991 when it enacted the Defense Authorization Act, Public Law 101-510.  The AFRH is comprised of the Armed Forces Retirement Home – Washington, DC (AFRH-W) and Armed Forces Retirement Home – Gulfport, Mississippi (AFRH-G).  Each site offers independent, Long-Term Care/Skilled Care, Assisted Living and Special Care (dementia) options for its residents.  Each site is maintained as a separate establishment of the AFRH for administrative purposes.  This contract applies only to AFRH-W.


SECTION 2 – RESPONSIBILITIES
Non-personal Services: Contractor shall provide transportation support on an on-call basis to the Armed Forces Retirement Home-Washington, 3700 North Capitol Street, NW, Washington, DC 20011. Transportation services shall be provided to accommodate transporting residents to and from area hospitals, doctors and dialysis appointments in the greater Washington, D.C. area to include transporting specimens to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC). The “normal working hours” of the transportation need is from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm, six (6) days a week.  There are also some “other than normal working hours” transportation needs from 8:00 pm to 6:00 am.  The transportation vendor may be asked, on occasion, to transport a resident to an area hospital on a Sunday for preoperative testing and admission for surgery. The vehicles must be ADA compliant along with having the capability to transport wheelchair and stretcher confined patients.  The average medical transportation need is 15 residents per day.  AFRH-W will provide the vendor a schedule twenty-four (24) hours in advance to ensure a smooth transportation operation.  Appointments are coordinated with the area hospitals and doctor’s offices in sufficient time to allow the facility to generate a patient list on a daily basis; but, there are rare situations in which the resident will need to be transported as an “add on” for that day’s trip list. The residents may be in varying degrees of health and may require assistance from one of our staff members (CNA) and the vehicle must be large enough to accommodate the resident and the staff member.  Most trips to local medical facilities are within a 20-mile radius of the AFRH with the exception of some trips to Bethesda.

Prime Contractor must meet with AFRH-W contracting personnel for an orientation of the Home’s policies/procedures concerning vehicle safety while transporting residents both on and off campus prior to receiving the first series of calls.

SECTION 3 – OPERATING HOURS
Normal working hours Monday-Saturday                 6:00 A.M.  -  8:00 P. M.
Other than normal working hours                              8:01 P. M.  -  5:59 A. M.

EW Directorate testing will benefit from the uniform illumination of target surfaces and accurate gain measurement.  

2.	The Double Ridge Wave Guide Horn (Antenna), Model 3117 is a recently designed antenna and will be a direct replacement part for the existing ETS/EMCO 3115 antenna currently in use.  The 3117 Horn (antenna) represents significant advances in performance over the 3115 as detailed below. The salient functional characteristics that are essential to the Electronic Warfare Directorate are:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Please respond by providing a proposal to the Statement of Work below by emailing micaela.bowers1@us.army.mil by 12:00 noon EST on 23 Sep 2005. Statement of Work to be performed: TATRC/DEWITT ARMY HOSPITAL STATEMENT OF WORK September 16, 2005 1.	Task Order Title. Computer-Based Problem Knowledge Couplers on the Development of Diagnostic Skills in Musculoskeletal Medicine for Medical Students and Newly Graduated Residents  2.	Objective.  The Department of Health Affairs is looking for ways to provide consistent health care to soldiers and other Department of Defense (DoD) beneficiaries. Use of automation tools, such as the problem knowledge coupler, extends a health care providers basic f und of knowledge and enables a more comprehensive differential diagnosis.  Unlike other computer-based diagnostic tools that analyze only the information that is entered into the machine to make a diagnosis, the Problem Knowledge Coupler (PKC) actually sug gests information through cross referencing and categorizes the information in order of statistical significance. There is no comparable medical history taking or medical recording keeping tool to date.  Utilization of the problem knowledge coupler as a te aching tool may be the answer to the lack of time to teach critical areas in depth. It lends itself well to current educational tools such as problems-based learning. Currently, (PKC) is being used as a tool to collect comprehensive historical patient information in order to assist diagnosis and management in primary clinical medical situations. Pilot projects are now in place in medical clinics at Fort Knox, KY and May port Navy Base, FL.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  F2V303TIMBER is a solicitation issued as a request for quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the associated NAICS code is 115310 and small business size standard is $6M.  Line item number 0001 has a quantity of 25000 tons as the unit of measure for SLASH-PINE PULPWOOD. 

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

PINE TIMBER SALE

TP-01.  SCOPE OF WORK: The contractor shall furnish all labor and materials to remove pine timber from the Avon Park Air Force Range.  The area consists of approximately 750 acres.

TP-02.  LOCATION OF PROPERTY: The areas to be harvested are at various locations at the Avon Park Air Force Range, Florida.  Specific areas will be designated by the Forester.

TP-03.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:

a.    Timber to be cut and removed under this contract consists of approximately 25,000 tons with an estimated product breakdown of 5,000 tons of pine pulpwood/mulchwood and 20,000 tons of pine chip-n-saw logs.  This is only an estimate.  The Air Force does not guarantee any quantity or product amount.  The Air Force will also receive full price for any wood culled due to improper sorting.

b.    All trees should be utilized to a top diameter of 2.5 inches unless extreme branchiness makes utilization to this size impractical.  All top-wood greater than 16 feet in length shall be removed   

c.    All trees shall have a stump height of three inches or less above the ground.

d.    The contract will be for a period of 9 months.  An extension up to 24 months may be granted if approved by the Base Forester.

e.    Harvesting shall begin within ten working days after "Notice to Proceed."  Starting of work can be delayed only if approved by the Base Forester.

 

f.     All trees designated for harvesting shall be removed from the work area before operations are moved to a new location.  The area shall be cleaned and then inspected by the Forester before the crew moves to a new location.  Areas that are determined to be excessively wet by the Forester shall be worked at a later period.

g.    Trees not designated for removal under this contract which are cut, felled, or otherwise seriously damaged through negligence by the contractor's operations shall be paid for by the contractor at the rate of $3.00 per inch in diameter, measured across the stump if cut or 4.5 feet from the ground (DBH) if uncut.  Trees for which the contractor is so charged shall be considered as designated trees and at the contractor's option may be cut and removed.

TP-04.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

a.    The Base Forester shall be contacted either in person or by telephone, (863) 452-4119 ext. 302, prior to performing work under this contract.

b.    To avoid any conflicts with other natural resources programs, endangered species, wetlands, or the military mission of the Air Force, the Base Forester will approve all hauling roads, skid trails, wood ramps, and trailer locations.  The Forester will determine which timber stand will be harvested first and the harvesting order of the other stands.  Harvesting operations may temporarily be halted or be restricted 

to certain periods of time to coincide with the overall management or the military mission of the installation.

c.    All environmentally sensitive areas shall be avoided by all of the contractor's operations.  The Base Forester will identify the boundaries of these sensitive areas prior to initiation of work.

TP-05.  UNFORSEEN CIRCUMSTANCES:

Due to unforeseen circumstances, selected timber stands may be added, deleted or substituted for other timber stands in this timber sale.  The contractor or Government shall have the option to renegotiate prices, quantities, etc. to ensure fairness to all parties.  The Air Force may also terminate this timber sale for any reason by giving the contractor seven (7) days written notice.  

TP-06.  PAYMENT AND BIDDING

a.    Bids will be placed on a composite (single-price) basis.  The basis for payment is per ton.  One ton of wood equals 2,000 pounds.  Payment shall be made weekly, based upon the total tons removed.  A check made payable to the "United States Treasury" along with invoice tickets and security tickets shall be submitted to Kurt E. Olsen; 18 ASOG, DET 1, OL A/ CEVN; 29 South Boulevard; Avon Park Air Force Range, Florida 33825-9381.

b.    Each truckload of timber that leaves the Avon Park Air Force Range will have a security ticket stapled to a butt log behind the cab on the driver's side of the truck.  The Base Forester will issue these tickets and inform the contractor of the required procedure to follow.  All log trucks must now avoid the prison area by using Jennings and UTES Drives for access to Kissimmee Grade.  

TP-07.  UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE: The contractor is cautioned that unexploded ordnance and unburned flares may exist within the contract areas.  The contractor shall assume full responsibility for such property and shall discharge the Government from any and all damages directly and indirectly resulting from such property.  The contractor also agrees to hold the Government harmless from any and all claims arising therefore or incident thereto.  When found, these objects shall not be tampered with or removed.  The contractor shall immediately report these findings to the Base Forester so proper identification and disposal can be made by the Government.  Prior to commencement of work, all contract employees must attend an explosive ordnance disposal briefing.

TP-8.  TRASH AND REFUSE:  Any waste materials resulting from the contractor's operations shall be removed daily and disposed of as directed by the Base Forester.  All waste materials resulting from the contractor's operations that are left at the end of a week may be billed to the contractor at the minimum rate of $50 per item regardless of size or insignificance.  The contractor will also be responsible for any hazardous material spills or leakage from equipment.  If such an accident should occur, the contractor shall take immediately action to contain the spill and be responsible for any cleanup requirement to meet Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) standards.  The Base Forester will also be immediately notified and for anything else out-of-normal for harvesting operations.  Equipment leaking any hazardous materials will be immediately fixed.

Local clause 52.111-4131 states: Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice. Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342). (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees - Fast Access Gate Program) , commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours. These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays. On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5). Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained. All commercial vehicles will be searched. The Contractor should anticipate delays  in getting commercial vehicles on post. The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis. If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concret e for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority. On weekends large vehicles (ne eding greater than 12 foot-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis. Searched labels will be issued at th e Main Gate, as appropriate. Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12 foot-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis. The driver will receive a briefing on proper proce dures and a searched label. The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis. (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access  Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta. During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Cent er gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate. All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate , as appropriate and obtain visitor passes. Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the L ogistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate. The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes. (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is te rminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer. Local clause 52.111-4132  states: a. Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitor's pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis. A fast access identification badge will o nly be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week. Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access  Gate Program shall obtain a visitor's pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed). The visitor's pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time. A fast access identific ation badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program. The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program. b. The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Pro gram contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis. The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card. If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee. If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee. If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitor's pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet  the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitor's pass to the contractor employee. c. If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days  of such change. If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next workday. An employee 's inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitor's pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract. The FAGPC or the Government may change t he location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor. Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract. d. Fast access identification bad ges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees. If an employee's identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC a nd the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is dis covered. e. Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract. The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s). The identi fication badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued. f. The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges  and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for. g. If the Fast Access Gate Program is termina ted for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation. Local clause 52.111 -4004 states: In accordance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.
