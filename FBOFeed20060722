<DESC>The National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health, EIDIV, has a requirement  entitled "Recruitment, Scheduling, Coordination and Analysis of Hispanic immigrant and American-born worker focus groups for tailoring OSH training for Hispanic immigrant workers."    



The purpose of this contract is to provide services for the recruitment, scheduling, coordination and analysis of multiple focus groups of Hispanic immigrant and American born workers regarding occupational safety and health training. Coordination of the logistics for these focus groups will allow NIOSH researchers to better understand the differences in prior occupational safety and health (OSH) training, risk perception, risk acceptance and work adjustment strategies between recent (less than 2 years in U.S.) Hispanic Immigrant Workers (HIW), non-recent (more than 5 years in U.S.) Hispanic Workers (NRHW), African-American Workers (AAW), and non-Hispanic American Born Workers (ABW) by conducting a series of 28 focus groups.  The focus groups will be conducted in a community with an emerging Hispanic population (Cincinnati, Ohio) and in an area with an established Hispanic population (Santa Fe, New Mexico).  This information will be used in subsequent phases of the study to develop a culturally sensitive OSH training program for HIW in construction and to evaluate the effectiveness of culturally tailored OSH training modules as compared to untailored OSH training modules for HIW in construction.    

 

Cincinnati:    

A total of 16 focus groups (4 with HIW, 4 with NRHW, 4 with AAW and 4 with ABW) will be conducted in Cincinnati.  Participants for both the English and Spanish focus groups will be employed in blue-collar, working class jobs such as, but not limited to, meat packing, food service or construction.  To ensure that a broad range of perspectives are represented and to facilitate participation the 8 Spanish-language groups (HIW and NRHW) will be stratified by gender and education level (6th grade education or less, 7th to 12th grade education).  These stratifications are the same as those used in the pilot project for this current study.  The remaining 8 English-language focus groups (ABW and AAW) will be stratified by gender but not by educational level because American culture does not have as much deference for education as traditional Hispanic culture does.  In addition, due to mandatory educational laws in the U.S. there should be far less variability in educational levels among workers born in the U. S. than those born in Latin American.      

 

Santa Fe:    

A total of 12 focus groups (4 with HIW, 4 with NRHW and 4 with ABW) will be conducted in Santa Fe.  Given the low population density of African-Americans in Santa Fe no focus groups with AAW will be conducted there.  Participants for both the English and Spanish focus groups will be employed in blue-collar, working class jobs such as, but not limited to, meat packing, food service or construction. To ensure that a broad range of perspectives are represented and to facilitate participation the 8 Spanish-language groups (HIW and NRHW) will be stratified by gender and education level (6th grade education or less, 7th to 12th grade education).  These stratifications are the same as those used in the pilot project for this current study.  The remaining 4 focus groups with ABW will be stratified by gender but not by educational level because American culture does not have as much deference for education as traditional Hispanic culture does.  In addition, due to mandatory educational laws in the U.S. there should be far less variability in educational levels among ABW than those born in Latin American.    

 

Also essential is the scheduling and provision of appropriate facilities in which to conduct the focus groups.  The focus groups will range in size from 6 – 9 participants (HIW, NRHW, AAW, and ABW) and two facilitators (one contractor, one NIOSH).  The room should be equipped with a table to hold the recording equipment and 11 chairs.  In addition, the location should be familiar to the community from which the participants are being drawn and be free from noise and interruption to insure privacy and high quality recordings of the proceedings.  As mentioned above half of the focus groups for each group and strata will be held in Cincinnati and the other half in Santa Fe except for the AAW focus groups which will be held exclusively in Cincinnati. Within the scope of this contract, the logistics of recruiting participants for the focus groups will include providing any compensation to the participants for their time at the focus group, if deemed appropriate. Basic provisions (refreshments and bathroom facilities) should also be included in coordination and scheduling of interview facilities.     

 

In addition, this contract calls for collaboration with the NIOSH researchers in analyzing the data collected so that the insights can be used in subsequent phases of the study as well as for submissions to peer reviewed academic journals.  Essential to these efforts will be 1) developing a process that facilitates the contributions of the identified project consultants, 2) the management of a data throughout the analysis process including providing transcriptions and translations of the focus groups, 3) participating in the analysis sessions to develop conclusions that will be used in subsequent phases of the study and for submission to peer reviewed journals.      

 

In order to ensure the quality of the data the contractor will have 1) conducted occupational safety and health research in the Latino immigrant community in both established as well as emerging communities, 2) published results of qualitative and mixed method studies in peer reviewed academic journals, and 3) coordinated multi-disciplinary academic research teams.   See Attachment A for suggested contractors.    

 

The content analyses of the focus group data will be used to guide development of a research questionnaire that will be used to further assess differences in OSH training histories, risk perception, risk acceptance and adjustment strategies between HIW, NRHW, AAW and ABW in the second phase of this study.     

 

Specific Aims:      

 

Statement of Work     

 

Task 1:  Recruit and schedule focus group participants including appropriate facilities.    

 

The contractor will recruit participants and schedule approximately 28 focus groups (8 with HIW, 8 with NRHW, 8 with ABW, 4 with AAW) with workers from a broad range of industries to identify the unique aspects of the HIW experience.  Of these 28 focus groups 16 (4 with HIW, 4 with NRHW, 4 with ABW and 4 with AAW) will take place in Cincinnati, OH and the remaining 12 (4 with HIW, 4 with NRHW, 4 with ABW) will take place in Santa Fe, NM.  Participants in the HIW focus groups should have been born in Latin America, have been in the United States less than two years, have no more than a 12th grade education, and be currently employed.  Participants in the NRHW focus groups should have been born in Latin America, have been in the United States for at least five years, have not more than a 12th grade education and be currently employed.  In addition, the Hispanic groups should be stratified by gender and education level (6th grade and below; 7th – 12th grade) with an equal number of groups being conducted in each category. Participants in the ABW focus groups should have been born in the United States, not be of Hispanic decent, have no more than a 12th grade education and be currently employed.  Participants in the AAW focus groups should have been born in the United States, be of African-American decent, have no more than a 12th grade education and be currently employed.  While the English-speaking focus groups will be stratified by gender they will not be stratified by education.     

 

The contractor will be responsible for recruiting and scheduling 28, focus group sessions to accommodate a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 9 participants per session. Recruitment and scheduling will be performed until a minimum of 168 participants is achieved. The contractor will be responsible for providing appropriate facilities to accommodate 9 focus group participants, 2 facilitators (one NIOSH researcher, one contractor), and NIOSH audio recording equipment and microphones. Basic provisions (refreshments and bathroom facilities) should also be included in coordination and scheduling of focus group facilities. The contractor must also be able to set up a mechanism for providing each focus group participant with compensation for his/her time at the conclusion of the focus group session.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a time-and-material delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-05-G-0008 to Raytheon Missile Systems for sustaining engineering and management support for Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) software products. This effort will include the disposition and prioritization of Software Change Requests (SCR) and Test Problem Reports (TPR), engineering investigation of anomalous system performance, correction to test and simulation artifacts, resolution of system obsolescence, maintenance of software laboratory facilities and documentation updates. (THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS). This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of Title 10, U.S.C. Section 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Unless stated herein, no additional information is available. Requests for the same will be disregarded. A determination by the Government not to compete this effort is solely within the discretion of the Government. GENERAL INFORMATION: Raytheon has a unique knowledge base of the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) as a result of its design, development, and modification of these weapon systems since the early 1990s. Accordingly, Raytheon is the only known qualified, responsible source that can fulfill the requirements specified herein.  Subcontracting opportunities may be available and should be sought with Raytheon at the following address: Raytheon Missile Systems, P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for the supplies and services anticipated herein is 336414 “Guided Missile and Space Vehicle Manufacturing.” Once NAVAIR finalizes its requirements for the subject effort, a prerequisite for receiving contract award will be registration in the DoD’s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. For more information on the CCR, contact the CCR Assistance Center at 888-227-2423. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for the effort mentioned above. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. The Point of Contact (POC) for this synopsis is John F. Antol, Contracting Officer, ph: 301-757-7046, email address John.Antol@navy.mil. See note 22!!

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    Statement of Objectives Increment 3 Government Acceptance Testing Support 10 July 2006 Revised 22 July 2006 1.0	Background The Army Program Executive Office (PEO) Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) Standard Procurement System (SPS) Joint Program Management Office (JPMO) is in the process of acquiring and fielding a commercially based application to support the automation of contracting offices through the Department of Defense (DoD). This program will continue in an evolutionary spiral development cycle for several years and will require the use of modern technologies to perform its mission. To meet mission requirements, the JPMO is introducing SPS Increment 3 which converts the application from a client-server architecture to a web-based environment. It is a component based, n-tier, open and scalable solution that improves performance, operat es on a variety of hardware platforms and supports large transaction volumes. The browser based user interface reduces client-side hardware and software requirements, increases accessibility and lowers the total cost of ownership. Increment 3 is interopera ble and it facilitates information sharing by all business functions within an organization and throughout the supply chain. It is standards based, open and thin. SPS Increment 3 supports asynchronous processing and has greatly improved data validation, er ror handling and rendering. It is, indeed, a technologically advanced application that will fully support its intended audience. 2.0	Scope The objective of this effort is to obtain support and assistance for the JPMO Government Test Facility (GTF) during the government validation and verification (GV&V) during the period 17 July to 15 September 2006 and potentially system acceptance testing ( SAT) of SPS Increment 3 during the period 13 November to 31 December 2006. The mission of the JPMO includes testing and government acceptance of all SPS initial or updated SPS products. It is expected that Increment 3 will be delivered for testing in July 2006. At that time, the JPMO plans to execute a distributed test plan that includes service provided test personnel. However, the JPMO anticipates that service test support will fall short of the overall requirement. In order for the government to thorough ly test the Increment 3 application, conduct a fair and impartial GV&V and SAT, as well as meet the required acceptance and subsequent deployment schedules, additional test support is an absolute necessity. 3.0	Applicable Documents All documents and training required by the contractor to perform the work outlined in this order will be provided by the government before or during execution of the tasks. 4.0	Program Objectives The GTF is a small, independent group of professionals that perform the integral testing mission for the government. During major test evolutions, such as SPS Increment 3 government validation and verification and acceptance testing, the GTF is supported a nd augmented by personnel identified by the services. The JPMO anticipates that service support will fall short of the total requirement. The government, however, must fully test the application to ensure a quality product is produced and accepted for depl oyment. The augmentation to the GTF staff with personnel that are either knowledgeable of SPS or the overall procurement process for this period is critical to the governments acceptance of the product. The upcoming Increment 3 test period will test and validate 6465 total joint requirements and regression test nearly 500 issues from previous testing efforts. The initial test and validation of requirements is expected t o take 12 weeks (60 business days). The joint requirements will be tested utilizing an operational scenario approach. There are approximately 250 operational scenarios that must be completed to ensure each requirement is fully tested. For the regression te st, each issue requires a significant amount of setup time in order to emulate the circumstances in place when the issue was initially discovered, documented and validated. The full test must be completed efficiently and on time to minimize the cost to the  government, and to meet programmatic requirements. These additional support personnel will allow the government to provide its due diligence in the testing process and subsequent acceptance of the product.  The contractors objective is to providea qualified personnel that are knowledgeable of SPS operations or knowledgeable of the government procurement process, and are capable of being trained to utilize the Increment 3 application to assist the GTF during the GV&V and potentially during the SAT of the product during the period 17 July to 15 September 2006 and 13 November through 31 December 2006 respectively.  It is not anticipated to have a break in support.  However, the Government reserves the right to a djust the resource requirement, as necessary.  A table is provided below: During the GV&V Test, the number of Resources coul start with 10 and they would begin Training  8/7/06  Begin Testing 8/14/06  End Date for GV&V  9/15/06  Then Plus 10 Begin training on 8/21/06 and begin testing on 8/28/06 and GV&V ends on 9/15/06.  Contin ued Regression Testing for the Same 20 resources from 9/18/06 through 11/3/06.  They don't need additional training and they begin Acceptance Test on 11/20/06 through 12/22/06. NOTE:  The Government will consider other proposed performance based approaches for this RFP. 5.0	Management and Technical Constraints Contractor access to vendor proprietary data may be required. Proprietary information obtained under this acquisition will not be used for any purpose other than that for which it was intended. The contractor will be required to provide a plan that clearly  describes the contractors roles, responsibilities and strategies.  Non-disclosure Agreements will be required.  A sample document is provided as part of this RFP. The contractor must have the capability to participate in frequent meetings with the JPMO staff located at the JPMO facility in Fairfax, VA.   Required Skill Sets:  Demonstrated experience with DoD Contract writing and the overall DoD Business process (requirements, contracts and payment); MS Windows and IT Savy.  Desired:  IV&V testing or other testing experience	 6.0	Contract Data Requirements In response to the governments statement of objectives, the contractor shall submit a proposal that details the personnel, product, schedule, deliverables and projected costs of each task to be performed under this acquisition. The contractor shall not be gin a task until the order has been awarded. Project accomplishments and results shall be documented in a monthly report that includes projected and actual hours on each contract effort. The contractor shall report financial data under this acquisition using a formal financial system that operates in accordance with accepted commercial accounting standards. It is preferred that this data be provided in electronic form. Reportable data will  include, but is not limited to, performance metrics and earned value or earned value-like system data. 7.0	Period of Performance The period of performance for this effort will be from award through 15 September and potentially through 31 December 2006 if determined to be required. 8.0	Place of Performance The work to be performed under this order will be conducted primarily in the SPS JPMO facility located at 4114 Legato Road, Fairfax, VA 22033. Work may also be performed at the contractors facility or at other government facilities as designated and approved by the Contracting Officers Representative (COR). Access to other government facilities required for completion of work under this order will be coordinated by the SPS JPMO. 9.0	Travel:  No travel is required under this order. Evaluation Criteria  Performance Based Acquisition In response to the government statement of objectives, the contractor shall submit a proposal that details the personnel, product, schedule, deliverables and projected costs of each task to be performed under this acquisition.  The Government intends to issue an award based on the proposal offering the best value solution. The Government reserves the right to not award a contract as a result of this competition, if in the opinion of the Source Selection Official (SSO), none of th e submitted proposals would provide satisfactory performance. The SSO may reasonable determine that the superior solution/approach merits a higher price, and therefore represents the best value to the Government. The SSO, using sound business judgement, wi ll base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal's relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors.  Factor 1 - Technical/Management Solution/Approach. Factor 2 - Performance Measurement and Management Program.  Factor 3 - Past Experience (include references for all contracts for the last 2 years).  Factor 4 - Price.  Factors 1 and 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3. While the price factor will be an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-price evaluation factors are significantly more important than the price factor . However, Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for non-price factors approach equal.  Evidence of the quality of the technical/management solution/approach includes:  (a) a coherent, actionable and realistic concept of operations that clearly articulates the operational aspects of a performance-based partnership and explicitly describes the expected performance of the Government and contractor teams.  (b) A comprehensive performance work statement and contract work breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.  (c) A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, standard, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive compliant, and cost effective services to meet the needs of the SPS JPMO an d its stakeholders.  (d) A sound partnering approach to managment that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to the SPS JPMO's business processes. The management approach provides: 1. Highly qualified and experienced perso nnel with a proven track record of success. 2. Transparent governance procedures that include clear lines of open and honest communication between the Contractor's team and the Government for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution. Progra m clearly fosters a partnering environment that is based on achieving shared goals and objectives.Instructions:  1.  This 100% set-aside for Small Business.
