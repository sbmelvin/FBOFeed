<DESC>Abstract:  Thermal insulation of the pulse tube in a pulse-tube refrigerator is maintained by optimally varying the radius of the pulse tube to suppress convective heat loss from mass flux streaming in the pulse tube. A simple cone with an optimum taper angle will often provide sufficient improvement. Alternatively, the pulse tube radius r as a function of axial position x can be shaped with r(x) such that streaming is optimally suppressed at each x.

Market Applications:  Cryogenic refrigeration using pulse-tube refrigerators, for applications such as natural-gas liquefaction; air separation via distillation to produce gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and argon; cooling for superconducting electronics, etc.  

Benefits: 	The efficiency of pulse-tube refrigerators can be improved dramatically by practicing this invention.

Intellectual Property Status:  U.S. Patent Number 5,953,920 issued on September 21, 1999.  The University is seeking to license this technology for development and commercialization.  Respondents interested in obtaining such a license are asked to send letters of interest to the attention of Kathleen Herrera at the address below.  The University will accept such letters until October 6, 2003.  Those respondents will then be asked to prepare a commercialization plan explaining how that company envisions commercializing the technology.  The University will select a potential licensee based on the content of the commercialization plans submitted by the respondents and proceed from that point into license negotiations for rights in the technology.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, (SPAWARSYSCEN) San Diego, in support of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) and DoD, is seeking proposals (technical and cost) for research and development in the following areas: (1) microelectronics, (2) micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and/or (3) photonics technology. Proposals for research and development addressing the technologies that rely on heterogeneous integration across these three areas to achieve complex multifunctional systems capabilities in chip-scale packages are specifically included.  Such a system might include sensors/emitters, processors, power sources, clocks, etc., that might be designed to operate under difficult conditions.  Chem/Bio chips for detection of chemical or biological threats, chips that dynamically adapt to their environment, intelligent chips that filter sensor input from the outside world, or network centric enabling components are all representative of these areas of interest.  The tight coupling of lasers with highly integrated digital circuits for high bandwidth signal access to memory is another example.  These heterogeneously integrated chips are expected to aid in MTO's current goal to develop and exploit micro-scale sense and action amplifiers for the war fighter, establish battle space information channels with greatest bandwidth possible, and provide degrees of connectivity not possible with present technologies.  Proposed efforts should offer the potential for a significant impact on the current technology and have bearing on issues confronting our Defense and National Security.  New technologies and approaches to these issues are particularly encouraged.  Additional information on the programs within MTO is available within the DARPA web site (http://www.darpa.mil/mto). This announcement will be open through 10 November 2004.  Awards may be made at any time throughout this period.  Such awards will depend upon evaluations described below and availability of funds. The Government further reserves the right to issue contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions.  Award decisions will be based on a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a peer and/or scientific review. The full set of evaluation criteria (listed in order of importance) are as follows: (1) Overall scientific or technical merits of the proposal; (2) potential transition to Department of Defense systems; (3) availability of funds; (4) the Offeror's capabilities, past performance, plan of execution, and facilities; (5) realism of the proposed cost.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke  (NINDS), Light Imaging Facility (LIF) plans to procure full service maintenance support for a base year plus three (3) option year periods for a Carl Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope located in the NINDS Light Imaging Facility, microscope; serial number 851220 and Meta detector serial number 2110000255 from Carl Zeiss, Inc., One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12 and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811310 and the business size standard is $6.0M.  The Light Imaging Facility (LIF) is an Institute-wide facility that provides scientists in the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) with access to state-of-the-art light imaging equipment.  These highly complex instruments incorporate technology and components that were devised  and are available exclusively from, Carl Zeiss, Inc. This instrument requires yearly preventative maintenance for optimal performance. In addition, when components such as the scanners or visible-wavelength lasers break down, they must be replaced. This maintenance agreement ensures that the necessary preventative maintenance and repairs are provided on a timely basis by competent technicians. In addition, it will entitle NINDS to all software upgrades that become available.   Carl Zeiss, Inc. is the only source known to the NINDS that can provide the aforementioned services. In addition, the software that supports the database and many of the hardware components of the confocal microscope are proprietary to Carl Zeiss. All essential replacement parts for this system must be able to become an integrated part of the microscope and must be maintained by factory trained personnel.  To award this contract to another manufacturer would entail the purchase of a whole new system at an extensive cost to the Government.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Institute of Health (NIH) to procure professional services on a sole source basis with Mary L. James, St. Louis, MO, to continue services currently being provided by the contractor under purchase order number 467-MZ-300616-1 for the period of January 1, 2004 to March 31, 2004.  The contractor will continue to provide the administration and delivery of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) 101 programs.  These programs are crucial to The Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW's) basic mission to conducts programs of clarification and guidance with respect to the use of animals in research.  Four IACUC 101s have been conducted under the current contract; the addition time and effort to this contract will enable continuation of this program into early 2004, with IACUC 101s in Nashville on November 4, in Dallas on February 17, and in Boston on March (exact date to be determined).  Mary Lou James is the only individual who has successfully organized and executed 23 IACUC 101s since 1998.  Seventeen of these were co-sponsored by OLAW.   The IACUC 101 training program was developed by four individuals under the auspices of the Applied Research Ethics Association (ARENA).  Mary Lou James has since taken the lead role in continual development and refinement of the program, and in planning, organizing, and executing the training sessions.  She is responsible for development of an extensive checklist of the steps necessary for the successful delivery of the 101 sessions, the content of an extensive Resource Manual provided to each participant, scenarios that are used as educational tools during the mock IACUC session portion of the training, and post-program evaluation of attendee comments.  Each of these components is critical to a successful IACUC 101 and she is the only individual with the knowledge, experience, and resources to administer these training sessions.  Additional funds, time and effort are needed in order for the contractor to complete the project.  Introducing a new contractor at this point in time would add significant amount of training time, government coordination, and therefore costs to the government.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide service as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office within fifteen (15) calendar days from publication date of this notice, and must include pricing information and meet the criteria requirement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>NIAID is establishing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit proposals to address the Institute’s need for research programs focused on identifying associations between specific immune response gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to infection, or the quality of response to vaccination, with a focus on one or more of the high priority NIAID Category A, B, or C pathogens listed at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm.  The correlation of genetic polymorphisms with response to phenotypes, such as severity of infection, or with vaccination outcome, will be further studied through the analysis of expression levels and/or functions of the proteins encoded by the variant immune response genes.

Materials for such studies will be obtained by the Offeror from patients with a history of natural infections; individuals currently enrolled in vaccine trials; and/or previously vaccinated high-risk groups, such as military, laboratory, and health care personnel.  In addition efforts will be made to include at-risk groups such as the very young, the elderly, and individuals with immunodeficiencies.  Genomic information from mouse model systems can be used to facilitate identification of relevant human immune response genes.  Particular emphasis is placed on studies identifying host immune factors that play a role in controlling, protecting, or predisposing to an infection; exacerbating disease; determining resistance to treatments.  Interdisciplinary teams that combine diverse scientific expertise (e.g., microbiology, immunology, genetics, mathematics, computer science) will be encouraged.
 
The NIAID expects to award six (6) to twelve (12) cost reimbursement, completion type contracts, each with a period of five (5 year), beginning approximately September, 2004.  RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-BAA-04-18 will be made available electronically on or about September 22, 2003 with proposals due on January 8, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>Abstract:  A regenerator-based engine or refrigerator has a regenerator with two ends at two different temperatures, through which a gas oscillates at a first oscillating volumetric flow rate in the direction between the two ends and in which the pressure of the gas oscillates, and first and second heat exchangers, each of which is at one of the two different temperatures. A dead-end side branch into which the gas oscillates has compliance and is connected adjacent to one of the ends of the regenerator to form a second oscillating gas flow rate additive with the first oscillating volumetric flow rate, the compliance having a volume effective to provide a selected total oscillating gas volumetric flow rate through the first heat exchanger. This configuration enables the first heat exchanger to be configured and located to better enhance the performance of the heat exchanger rather than being confined to the location and configuration of the regenerator.

Market Applications:  The present invention may be used in thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators including Stirling engines and refrigerators as well as pulse-tube refrigerators and hybrids thereof.

Benefits: 	This technology overcomes the geometrical constraints that make it difficult to build heat exchangers cheaply; geometrical constraints also make it difficult to achieve excellent heat transfer in heat exchangers in regenerator-based engines and refrigerators.  This technology overcomes those challenges by providing for greater surface area for heat exchangers, higher heat-transfer coefficients, and more structural design options.  

Intellectual Property Status:  U.S. Patent Number 6,560,970 issued on May 13, 2003 on this technology.  The University is seeking to license this technology for development and commercialization.

<DESC>Abstract:  Energy transfer apparatus has a resonator for supporting standing acoustic waves at a selected frequency with a steady flow process fluid thermodynamic medium and a solid medium having heat capacity. The fluid medium and the solid medium are disposed within the resonator for thermal contact therebetween and for relative motion therebetween. The relative motion is produced by a first means for producing a steady velocity component and second means for producing an oscillating velocity component at the selected frequency and concomitant wavelength of the standing acoustic wave. The oscillating velocity and associated oscillating pressure component provide energy transfer between the steady flow process fluid and the solid medium as the steady flow process fluid moves through the resonator.

Market Applications:  Systems that rely on thermodynamic processes in fluids such as refrigerators, air conditioners, heat pumps, engines, etc. 

Benefits: 	This invention overcomes the two critical shortcomings suffered by cyclic thermodynamic systems:1) the need for at least two heat exchangers, which contribute to a system’s inefficiency, to transfer heat between a thermodynamic working and a process fluid; and 2) the inefficiencies caused by irreversible heat transfer between a cyclic thermodynamic system’s heat exchanger and the incoming process fluid.  This invention overcomes these two problems with conventional cyclic thermodynamic systems through the combination of a cyclic thermodynamic process with an externally applied steady flow of an open thermodynamic process.  

Intellectual Property Status:  U.S. Patent Number 6,164,073 issued on December 26, 2000.  The University is seeking to license this technology for development and commercialization.  Respondents interested in obtaining such a license are asked to send letters of interest to the attention of Kathleen Herrera at the address below.

<DESC>This is a notice of NIST's intent negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106(1)(b), Only One Source Reasonably Available, to modify Purchase Order SB1341-03-N-1267 and procure additional products and services under that Purchase Order.  The aforementioned purchase order was awarded to National Office Systems ("NOS") of Gaithersburg, Maryland on July 7, 2003 for purchase of products and services to implement an OPUS 32 Records Management Software System at NIST.  The additional products and services to be procured under this purchase order are for use in conjunction with those products and services already procured from NOS.  The additional items to be procured include two Checkpoint Systems, Inc. RFID checkout stations, one Symbol RFID portable barcode reader with related Checkpoint Systems Inc. software, 12,000 Checkpoint Systems, Inc. RFID tags, and related conversion services.  The solicitation that resulted in P. O. SB1341-03-N-1267 being awarded to NOS was advertised in FedBizOpps, and this procurement action will result in a modification to that purchase order.  NIST believes that it would present logistical difficulties to procure the additional required products and conversion services from a second source, since the period of performance for the aforementioned purchase order with NOS is still ongoing and it would not make good business sense to have two different Contractors performing implementation services for the same system.  The Government does not anticipate procuring additional products or services for this system.  This is not a request for quotation, and no solicitation is available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of A002 to RFQ No. EMV-2003-RQ-0046 is to provide additional information as a result of another question received by the Government based on the issuance of the combined synopsis/solicitation and to provide an answer to said questions.  QUESTION:  Is it imperative that the requirement identified in paragraph 2.2.5 of the specifications be met (i.e., "Remote - The UPS logic shall be capable of remote operation allowing activation of the following functions from a remote location:  a.  Inverter stop.  b.  Inverter start.  c.  Emergency power off.").  Is this specification being directed to a specific brand of UPS?   ANSWER:  The requirement in paragraph 2.2.5 is included because the Government desires the capability to monitor and control all large UPS units on the Government facility from a central control room, for both operational and safety reasons.   The specifications for this requirement were based upon Mitsubishi Electric Automation (www.meau.com) equipment, although they were extensively edited to remove proprietary requirements.  No further questions will be entertained by the Government following the issuance of this Amendment No. A002.  END OF AMENDMENT NO. A002 TO RFQ NO. EMV-2003-RQ-0046.

CONTRACT INFORMATION:  CONTACT:  POC Mr. John Barnes 601/631-5485.  One (1) Fixed Price Contract will be negotiated and awarded, with a base period and one option period.  The anticipated contract award date is May 2004.  The work will be accomplished w ithin the Vicksburg District, but may be in contiguous districts.  This announcement is a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  Effective 14 June 1999, the small business size standard for A-E services is 4.0 million, NAICS code 541330.  Subcontracting intentions are  outlined in Block 6 of SF 255.  2.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  The work consists of taking a defined number of discharge measurements on a routine basis along the Mississippi, Red, and Ouachita Rivers.  The measurements will be taken with the use of an Acousti c Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and a single beam depth sounder.  The data collected will be imported into personal computer software specifically designed to calculate flow measurements.  The software (program code) currently in use in the Vicksburg Dis trict will be made available during advertisement.  The work will also require collecting daily water stage data at approximately 50 gaging sites throughout the Vicksburg District and reporting information daily and monthly to the Vicksburg District.  Addi tional work will consist of maintenance of permanent reference elevation markers at each gaging site and infrequent collection of sediment samples at specific discharge ranges.  Extreme flow conditions may require a combination of the ADCP, a single beam d epth sounder, and differential GPS.  The contractor may be required to take special purpose flow pattern and discharge measurements at lock and dam locations.  The contractor may be required to verify his system by comparison with conventional discharge me thods.  All measurements will be in English units.

<SUBJECT>A--TEAMING OPPORTUNITY NO. 2 FOR THE HIGH CAPABILITY INSTRUMENTS FOR PLANETARY EXPLORATION NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT (NRA-03-OSS-01-HCIPE)
<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center is seeking University and Industry partners for the High Capability Instruments for Planetary Exploration (NRA-03-OSS-01-HCIPE) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) Synopsis: The High Capability Instruments for Planetary Exploration  (HCIPE) Program supports the development of spacecraft-based instrument technologies that provide capabilities well beyond those of existing flight instruments.	The primary goal of this program is to promote the development of a new generation of scientific instruments for planetary exploration that can take advantage of the capabilities enabled by nuclear electric power and propulsion (NEPP).  These NEPP-enabled capabilities include:  ·	Electrical power ranging from 10-100 kW;  ·     Data rates ranging from 10 to 100 Megabits/sec for acquisition and transmission to Earth;	·    Instrument mass up to 500 kg;  ·	 Long observation times at targets;  ·	 High delta V capability enabling multi-target rendezvous; and · High duty cycles enabling extended instrument operating times. The Solar System Exploration Division (SSED) identified planetary science missions that are uniquely enabled by NEPP technologies under development by the Project Prometheus.  The first of these missions is the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO).  JIMO is an ambitious mission that will orbit three planet-sized moons of Jupiter - Callisto, Ganymede, and Europa - which may harbor vast oceans beneath their icy surfaces.  This mission would orbit each of these moons and perform extensive orbital investigations of their makeup, their history, and their potential for sustaining life.	JIMO-class follow on missions are also under consideration by NASA.  The goal of this program is to begin development of science instruments that could potentially be launched within a decade on the JIMO spacecraft.  The total anticipated budget for this technology research program is expected to be $5M and is expected to fund approximately 10-15 investigations. New measurement concepts may also be proposed to the HCIPE program.  In addition, modifications of existing instruments designed for previous low power space missions may also be proposed. NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the HCIPE Program to develop proposals and begin development of science instruments that could be potentially be launched within a decade. Subject to the availability of funds, selected proposal(s) would result in contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide instrument(s) consistent with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel: This criterion evaluates the proposers' relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development, and key personnel available to support the development.

<SUBJECT>J -- NOTICE OF INTENT - SOLE SOURCE OF SPECIALIZED REPAIRS
<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to award a sole-source purchase order for repair services under authority of FAR 6.302.1 to Ion Track Instruments.  Ion Track is the manufacturer of the explosive detection equipment and is the only known source of the parts and technical knowledge required for the high level repair of their proprietary equipment.  This requirement is for repairs that are beyond the knowledge and skill of Department of State technicians who received Ion Track’s repair training.  Therefore it is doubtful any other third party would have the expertise to perform these repairs.  A time and material purchase order issued under simplified acquisition procedures is anticipated.  This is not a request for quotation or proposal.  Any firm challenging the sole source award of this purchase order must submit their response to the contracting officer via email NLT September 17, 2003.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS A COMBINED SOLICITATION - AND IS THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PROVIDED.  PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. GovWorks is issuing this procurement under FAR Part 19.502-2 - Total Small Business Set-Aside.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation and this is the only announcement that will be released.  Please note that a full copy of this requirement is listed on the GovWorks website as http://www.govworks.gov.  This requirement is for the United States Agency for International Development. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) maintains a policy to promote the performance-based service contracts methodology, as it aims to improve the value of contracting services by soliciting a measurable output rather than the process or how the work is performed.  OFPP Policy Letter 91-2 provided that agencies should use performance-based contract methods to the maximum extent practicable when acquiring services, and that they also carefully select acquisition and contract administration strategies that best accommodate the requirements. In accordance with the project plan endorsed by the President's Management Council (PMC) initiative, Government agencies were requested to formally endorse PBSC as the preferred methodology when acquiring services by contract, and voluntarily pledge to convert self-selected contracts (preferrably recurring ones) for services to performance-based service contracting methods. In 1994, the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) set forth the agency's commitment to the performance-based contracts initiatives set forth by the NPR.  Since that time, USAID has confronted challenges with implementation of performance-based service contracting when trying to quantify contractor outputs in relationship to strategic or individual Mission objectives, measuring contractor results; and maintaining an atmosphere of partnership.  A. Statement of Objectives: The objectives of this order are as follows: 1)	Completion of a detailed assessment of the various contracts instruments and types of services typically purchased by USAID in support of development objectives, and recommendations on how the agency may best utilize the performance-based contract methodology.  The purpose is two-fold: to meet OMB requirements as discussed above as well as achieve results linked to agency strategic objectives.   2)	Develop three pilot performance-based requirements from development of the PWS through contract award to serve as models for the Agency.  One pilot will be developed for each agency Pillar Bureau. The scope of work is described in detail in the Statement of Work. If you are interested in this acquisition, you may locate the RFQ instructions and statement of work documents on the following website:   http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp The documents will be available on the govworks website in the late pm of September 12, 2003 The solicitation documents (solicitation instructions and the statement of work) are located at:  http://govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp, and identified as: 1435-04-03-RP 74141,  Assessment and Recommendations for USAID Performance-Based Services Contracts (PBSC) and Related Professional Services.  Important Due Dates:   1.  Technical Questions Due:  September 19, 2003 no later than 2:00PM Eastern Standard Time.  No questions will be accepted after the September 19, 2003 date and time.  The Government response will be posted on the FedBisOpps website. 2.  Technical and Cost Proposal Due October 3, 2003 on or before 2:00PM Eastern Standard Time

<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The combined synopsis/solicitation number is DABJ05-03-T-0839.  CLIN 0001- Pressure Test Relief Device (PTRD), PN: 9PTRD or equal.  The Pressure Test and Relief Device (PTRD) are used to protec t operators when removing or replacing plugs in chemical agent storage ton containers.  The device consists of a frame which nests inside the end (chime) of the ton containers to hold the PTRD in place.  Attached to the frame is the PTRD head, which fits o ver the plug to be removed.  The head has a socket and extension, which fit on the plug allowing removal.  Around the socket and extension is a small, gasket pressure chamber, which seals to the end of the ton container around the plug.  This pressure cham ber allows operators to introduce pressure into the ton container preventing any pressurized chemical agent from spraying out during plug removal.   The pressure chamber is connected to a series of valves and hoses, which facilitate pressure regulation and  venting during operation.  These valves are generally integrated into a glove box.  Since each application is different, the valve system provided would contain all of the necessary components, which can be field-fitted to the glove box.  This way, any gl ove box configuration can be accommodated.   Requisition Number W91CPU-3248-3001. Acceptance shall be at Destination.  Shipping shall be FOB Dest.

·	Test abrasive working mix for proper screen analysis and dense particle contamination
·	Conduct additional operator training programs as needed
·	Conduct equipment review and provide detailed reports

<DESC>Project 3F9 Studio Lighting Initiative
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (SOO)

1.0 Program Objective:
The objective of Project 3F9 is to assign a manufacturer to design, manufacture, install, test, perform maintenance training and studio lighting techniques training on nine complete turnkey studio lighting systems and fixtures at the Air Force Broadcasting Service's television stations overseas.  These broadcast locations support the Bases and communities with television news and information daily. 

2.0 Contract Objectives.
To allow manufacturers in the broadcast industry the flexibility to specifically define their solution to the requirement, perform installation of the items at each Government owned facility, and conduct proof of performance testing and follow-on instruction in managing the installed system, as well as instruction in lighting principles.   

2.1 Design, Removal, Installation and Test:
The design, delivery, removal of old light system and installation of complete, turnkey computer controlled studio lighting systems used to illuminate a minimum of one set and a maximum of three sets at each location listed in the RFP. Offerors shall include in their proposal the costs to perform an initial site survey to each of the Air Force Broadcasting Service’s locations as listed, to provide accurate development of Bill of Materials (BOM) to meet the requirements of the RFP.  The effective proposal will follow the Joint Travel Regulation (JFTR)/Per Diem for all travel; have travel costs limited to coach class air travel and government lodging per diem rates. Historical travel data shows these costs to be approximately $10k per theater of operation (Europe/Pacific).  The resulting BOM from these visits shall use the same brand of lighting equipment at all locations and be scalable to provide TV studio lighting systems to support nine Air Force owned broadcasting outlets of various size and scope and shall include personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and other items necessary to install complete lighting systems.  Contractor will be responsible for all meals for the installation team.  Offerors will ship lighting equipment to domestic location; government will supply transportation to overseas location in coordination with the Contractor’s schedule.  Performance of initial installation will occur at the Air Force Broadcasting Service location at Yokota Air Base, Fussa Shi, in Tokyo Japan.  Follow-on installations throughout the remaining locations are to occur simultaneously between the Japan and European areas of operation. Testing shall be performed as needed in each location to aid in the performance process and to document that the lighting systems meet performance requirements specified in the SOW.  
The Air Force will provide the electrical power, physical grid structure (pipe or rail) and disposal of old lighting equipment removed by contractor.

2.2 Configuration Management:
This is based upon establishment of a product baseline using previously manufactured equipment solutions of a similar scope with a demonstrated capability to satisfy the user's performance requirement. Contractor shall provide a comparative description of how these proposed solutions will adequately meet the specified requirement. Contractor shall clearly describe the capabilities of their proposal, as well as the scalability required to meet expanded studio usage in the future. As these systems are computer controlled, contractor shall define the mechanisms or processes wherein the government will maintain currency of controlling or communications software or hardware as required to sustain the performance of these lighting systems for a period of not less than ten years.  


2.3 Quality Control:
Development and presentation of installation drawings, performance standards, and test procedures to be used to verify the lighting control unit, communications software, control software, dimmer packs, and fixtures are produced and installed in accordance with supporting engineering data. Contractor shall address in their SOW all warranty provisions offered regarding the equipment or software deliverable under their proposal.

2.4 Training: 
The contractor shall provide training for studio lighting systems installed under this project SOW using contractor-owned/provided learning materials and methodologies to produce a graduate that satisfies the Air Force Broadcasting Service’s mission and learning objectives. 
The mission of the Air Force Broadcasting Service is to provide quality television production products in order to enhance each Commander’s Internal Information program. 
The objective of the course is to familiarize the student with various types of common lighting and related studio lighting techniques or standards. Guidance is provided on the efficient operation of contractor installed lighting systems. The course presents an approach to studio lighting that enables participants to recognize imagery problems such as those created by point of operation, poor balance of lighting, misplaced fixtures in such a manner as to achieve abatement. The course also includes an introduction to studio lighting. Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to: 
·	identify common imagery problems or inadequacies associated with poor lighting,  
·	identify root causes for lighting problems, 
·	select the lighting setup that applies to the existing sets in the studio, 
·	present options to achieve abatement of the imagery problem or inadequacy. 
Contractor personnel assigned to teach this course shall have expertise in the subject area and instructional experience. The personnel shall be knowledgeable of all initial presentation and remediation procedures, training aids, devices and equipment associated with the course and shall be evaluated by both the contractor and government. Contractor instructors will be evaluated by Government subject matter experts and by student critiques. 
Contractor is to provide all training materials used in the course.  There is no predetermined list of training materials, e.g. handouts, audiovisual aids, references, manuals, video tapes etc., to be used in the course; however, any training materials that are used shall be made available to the government to sustain lighting proficiency.


2.5 Logistics:
As a minimum, the contractor shall address the following areas regarding the logistics of this project:   Timeline for performing site surveys, Development and provisioning of all equipment and data necessary to support the studio lighting systems; Delivery and installation consistent with the performance requirements. Physical compatibility with existing government grid systems is fundamental. Electrical compatibility with supply voltages is also a critical factor.  

3.0 Method of Award
The Government anticipates awarding a task order to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Our intent is to award the contract based upon best value to the government. Of the factors listed, proven performance, availability of regional geographic technical support and use of current lighting industry technology together weigh more than cost alone. Cost will not be the sole determining factor in the selection process.


3.1 Price Proposal Evaluation
Offerors’ price proposals will be evaluated to determine price realism and reasonableness.  Prices which are excessively high or low may be considered unrealistic and unreasonable and may receive no further consideration.

3.2 Technical Approach

Evaluation of proposals will be based upon the following factors:
1)	proven historical performance of the offeror
2)	prior installations of similar or larger scope
3)	use of current studio lighting control technology
4)	warranty support- scope and depth 
5)	availability of regional geographic support for lighting instruments, control devices or components of the system offered
6)	overall project cost

3.3 Evaluation of Key Personnel
As a minimum, each proposed contractor will submit company qualifications for design, installation, maintenance training and studio lighting techniques training.

3.3.1 Technical Qualifications of key personnel
List personnel and technical qualifications of all key personnel  


4.0 Proposal Submission
The Government will request proposals for this task utilizing the IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) Web-based Order Processing System.  To receive a potential Request For Proposal (RFP), the potential offerors shall register their organization and their authority to submit quotes at the following Web Site:  

http://it-solutions.gsa.gov  

The contractor shall submit a written cost and technical proposal for consideration before the due date and time for this RFP.  If the proposal is for a Firm Fixed Price Type of Task Order, the contractor shall submit a payment schedule as part of the cost proposal.  In addition, the contractor shall submit these proposals electronically utilizing the ITSS system.  At the completion of negotiations, the contractor will ensure his Cost and Technical proposal reflects agreements and, if appropriate, submits revised proposals to the ITR/AM via ITSS.

5.0 Procedures for Payment.  
Billing and payment shall be accomplished in accordance with the contract.  The contractor shall have the invoice certified by the COR.  The contractor’s invoice will be for one month for services performed in the previous month.  The contractor may invoice only for the hours, travel and unique services ordered by GSA and actually used in direct support of the client representative’s project.  Invoices submitted for payment must be accompanied by a copy of the government’s document(s) (i.e. DD250 or similar form) accepting the covered services.  A copy of the invoice will be attached to the task in ITSS along with the Monthly Status Report.  Failure to comply with the procedures outlined above may result in your payment being delayed.  

6.0 Section 508 Compliance

All electronic and information technology (EIT) procured through this Statement of Work/Bill of Materials and any resulting contract, task order, delivery order, or purchase order must meet the applicable accessibility standards at 36CFR 1194, unless an agency exception to this requirement exists.  36 CFR 1194 implements Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and is viewable http://www.access-board.gov/508.htm.  The contractor shall indicate for each line item in the schedule whether each product or service is compliant or noncompliant with the accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194.  Further, the proposal must indicate where full details or compliance can be found (e.g., vendor’s website or other exact location).

7.0 Site Information
General Information:
Air Force Broadcasting detachments operate in four locations in Japan, two in Germany, one in Italy, one in Turkey, and one in the Azores (Portugal). For ease of consolidating geographic requirements, they are listed here in two categories: Pacific and European locations. 
Most of the locations listed are prepared to provide 110vac 50/60 Hz. Some are only wired for 220vac 50Hz operation. Lighting solutions defined in the contractor’s SOW  (control computers, dimmer equipment, lighting instruments) and any ancillary equipment defined shall address operation using both electrical supply voltages.  
Some of the stations operate in warm climates, where air conditioning systems are regularly tasked to their limits. For this reason, we prefer the use of fluorescent based lighting, or mixed lighting with minimal usage of incandescent fixtures to provide a balanced lighting environment with minimal heat conditions.
Each of the sites is described in detail in the following pages.
