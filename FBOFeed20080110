<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories, the lead engineering research and development laboratory for the Department of Energy, is seeking an organization to administer the National Institute for Nano-Engineering (NINE), which is anticipated to become a Discovery Science and Engineering  Innovation Institute (DSEII) under the America COMPETES Act.  Under this Act, NINE may have an annual budget of over $10,000,000 in three to five years, although it must be understood that NINE?s selection and budget are not certain.
NINE is a national innovation hub, based on a unique partnership between Sandia, Academia, and Industry, for engineering education and technology development.  The recently enacted America COMPETES Act supports the establishment of DSEIIs to inspire students to purse careers in science and engineering while also accelerating technical innovation.  The goal of NINE is to broaden students? education and capabilities in nano-engineering by engaging them in multi-disciplinary teams that work on pre-competitive, leading-edge technical research of direct interest to the nation.  Because the teams will be lead and mentored by some of the brightest stars working in nanotechnology, breakthrough discoveries are anticipated and students will gain rich technical experience and breadth by collaborating with top researchers in industry and academic institutions from around the country.  NINE will also expose students to other key aspects of realizing the social benefits of nanotechnology breakthroughs in science and engineering, including business, legal, political, and social issues.  NINE will also provide programs to expose science teachers to the excitement and potential of nanosciences and engineering and help them develop approaches to pass this excitement on to their students.
NINE seeks to support a program of ongoing nano-engineering research projects selected by a combination of commercial, academic, non-profit, and/or government organizations to address nationally important nanotechnology research areas and, through them, educational needs that are specific to nanotechnology, including the multi-disciplinary approach inherent in the development of nanotechnologies.  The program is expected to leverage Federal financial support with that of other partners from industry to fund research, educational programs, and curriculum development.  The program will also leverage the capital investment the Federal Government has made in infrastructure at the National Laboratories, specifically Sandia National Laboratories, through collaborative research programs and mentoring.
The NINE program at Sandia National Laboratories will conduct a formal competitive process to identify an organization to create and manage, on a continuing basis, NINE?s process for developing industrial sponsorship, for managing intellectual property (IP), and for reviewing, selecting, awarding, and monitoring research projects at universities.  Organizations that seek to be awarded the contract to create and manage such a process must document their ability to administer similar programs and provide a specific plan that explains how they will develop NINE?s processes (including but not limited to intellectual property and operational issues) and describes how they will administer the program in coming years.  The NINE program at Sandia National Laboratories reserves the right to choose one, or several organizations to perform these functions, to have one or all of these functions performed by the NINE program at Sandia National Laboratories , or to repeat some or all of the announcement and evaluation process with different requirements.
The successful organization must have national scale experience in setting up at least one external 501(c)3 for the purpose of administering programs at universities, or other research organizations.  It must have several years experience with soliciting industry participation and funding for non-commercial activities (e.g. research) and with administering, funding, monitoring, handling IP, and reviewing these non-commercial activities (e.g. research) with an annual aggregate budget of over $1,000,000.  Organizations will be reviewed on a best value basis.
Upon receipt of expressions of interest from responders to this posting Sandia will provide additional information and request abstracts from each responder documenting the responder?s specific capabilities and experience in relevant areas.  From these abstracts Sandia will select those responders who will be requested to respond to a detailed Request for Quote.
To express your interest in this opportunity please respond by mail or fax to Regan Stinnett by January 30, 2008 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0885, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87185-0885, Fax (505) 284-3093, E-mail: rwstinn@sandia.gov.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice.  Include company and contact information, as well as a brief description of how your company meets Sandia?s criteria.

<SOLNBR>08-SCIL
<ARCHDATE>01092009
<CONTACT>Inna I. Lloyd Contract Specialist 5205335248     Inna_I_Lloyd@nbc.gov;
<DESC>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is planning to solicit proposals for the SCIL (Socio-Cultural Content in Language) Program through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process. IARPA's SCIL Program is seeking innovative, creative, cutting-edge research to achieve advancements in technologies that significantly expand human language understanding.  As a mirror of socio-cultural norms and principles, language reflects people's beliefs, goals, intentions and relationships.  This R&D program intends to explore automated methods of correlating socio-cultural features with human language indicators.  The goal of the program is to develop new approaches to expanding our knowledge of context, meaning and identity. The unit of analysis for the initial efforts in this program is social groups.  These groups do not have to be named groups but should be made up of 2 to n participants (speakers/authors and audience) that have on-going interactions.  The socio-cultural phenomena and goals that groups might display include leadership, influence, coercion, recruitment, sentiment, intent, emerging behaviors, role of religion, group cohesion and state of membership (e.g., initiate, long-term).  The program is interested in providing evidence from the language used by group participants of such socio-cultural phenomena. It is the ultimate goal of the SCIL Program to discover, characterize and automate the correlation of a wide range of socio-cultural phenomena of groups with evidence from the language used by those groups.  The SCIL Program is generally not interested in enhancing or continuing the standard work done in Information or Content Extraction, Social Network Analysis nor Data Mining. SCIL program is envisioned as a five-year program. Year 1, which will begin in mid-2008, will involve exploratory efforts to define the problem, to investigate new and creative ways of advancing deep language understanding and to prototype the findings.  It is projected that multiple contracts will be awarded at funding levels adequate to support robust exploratory work. Two phases of two years each are projected for expanding the capabilities explored in Year 1 of the program.  The solicitation will be open to all research and development organizations located in the U.S., including large and small businesses, academic and eligible non-profit and not-for-profit institutions and collaborative ventures from mixed sources.   The Department of Interior, National Business Center (NBC), Acquisition Services Directorate, Sierra Vista Branch at Fort Huachuca, AZ plans to issue this solicitation on behalf of and in coordination with the IARPA. The BAA for Year I of SCIL will be released on or about February 1, 2008 at the following NBC web site: http://www.nbc.gov/acquisition/fort_h/solicit.html -link will be titled SCIL  Public comments/questions on the BAA will be accepted through February 15, 2008. These must be submitted in writing to the following e-mail address: Inna_I_Lloyd@nbc.gov referencing the title of the program SCIL in the subject line.  Potential offerors are requested to provide POC information, company name, mailing address, phone number, and email address with their questions. Answers will be posted as quickly as possible on the NBC web site above. The contracting office POC is Inna Lloyd at Inna_I_Lloyd@nbc.gov or phone (520) 533-5248.

<DESC>The Travelers? Health Team within the CDC Geographic Medicine and Health Promotion Branch, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ) has responsibility for the prevention of infectious diseases and non-infectious ailments among travelers which is a high priority for safeguarding the health of U.S. citizens. The Travelers? Health Team makes information available electronically, via its website (www.cdc.gov/travel); a toll-free automated hotline; answering public inquiries; and a textbook for health-care providers, Health Information for International Travel (the ?Yellow Book?). The Yellow Book, also available in its entirety online, has long been considered the ?gold standard? of travel medicine, both in the United States and abroad. Information contained in the Yellow Book is heavily relied on by health-care practitioners, travelers, the travel industry, and others who advise travelers, and is frequently cited in medical as well as non-medical publications, including news media such as the New York Times and the Washington Post. The production team for the Yellow Book continues to work towards creating a resource that contains current health recommendations for international travel, delivered in a user-friendly format that can be readily applied in the clinical setting.  The book is published every two years and the changes in the 2008 book included a substantially enhanced chapter on influenza that covers avian influenza and the threat of pandemic influenza. New chapters on skin and soft tissue infections and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism were added, as well as sections on health risks for humanitarian workers and the differing responsibilities that the clinician, traveler, and travel industry each have in providing and obtaining the best information on health risks abroad. 

DGMQ?s objective is to make the 2010 version of the Yellow Book more useful for and more targeted to US travel medicine and general healthcare practitioners. DGMQ is seeking one physician expert in travel medicine to serve as a Medical Editor (ME) for the 2010 edition. It is expected that the scientific and technical contribution of the ME to the 2010 edition would result in increased usability of the book by the 40,000 US general healthcare practitioners and 2000 travel medicine specialists who are asked to provide pre travel advice to patients planning international travel and who see patients after they return from travel.

The cycle of production for the next version (Yellow Book 2010) began in September 2007 and will be completed when the 2010 book is published in May 2009.  The Medical Editor is being sought now to begin work immediately.  The ME will work alongside the current ME, Dr Phyllis Kozarsky, an internationally renowned travel medicine consultant, and Dr Gary Brunette of CDC, who will serve as Managing Editor. It is expected that the overall time spent on the project by the ME will be approximately two months per year for two years.  The ME will not be required to work at CDC; the work can be done from home, but travel to CDC or other locations will be expected several times a year to meet with CDC staff.
  Should a firm outside of the immediate Atlanta, Georgia area be identified for this project, all travel must be of the most economic means and must be pre-approved by the technical monitor for this project.  The solicitation with statement of work will be available within 30 hours of this notice.  Please note that firms wishing to bid on this solicitation are hereby advised of the following; all vendors who wish to bid on this requirement MUST be registered and validated in the CCR prior to award of this Simplified Acquisition.  Vendors who submit a quotation are showing that they are already registered or plan to do so.   Quotations will be due fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of Request for Quotations or January 21, 2008, by 8:30 a.m. local time, whichever is later. All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.    Quotations must be submitted in writing to Gary  Morgan at gmorgan1@cdc.gov

<DESC>BASIC FUNCTIONS: The incumbent will serve as a key member of the USAID/RDMA staff.  Working under the broad general direction of the RDMA PDO Director overall, and day to day guidance from the USAID/Vietnam Representative while working in Vietnam, the incumbent will provide senior policy recommendations and advice while also becoming involved in the myriad of coordination tasks and operational details that are required in running an approximately $100 million annual assistance program with a relatively new staff.  Day-to-day activities will include a combination of strategic level management and policy guidance as well as operational responsibility at an activity level.  There is the potential for the scope to include travel in the region; interaction and guidance to USAID-funded contractors and grantees; coordination with other donors; and dialogue with leading counterparts in both the public and private sector.

It is especially important that the incumbent have experience with the reforms and directives issued by F over the past two years.  The reforms have increased the complexity of RDMA reporting requirements, and required changes in the structure of programs.  Since most of our staff in the Mission is new to USAID, experience at a senior level is critical.  

The position requires an experienced Program Office/Project Development Officer with the following:

1.	extensive experience in the design, implementation and reporting on regional and bilateral programs at a senior level in the field as well as in Washington; 
2.	proven experience with and a thorough understanding of the dynamic of implementing the new "F" reforms and the new foreign assistance goals framework; 
3.	proven ability with training and mentoring new USAID entrants to the Foreign Service, both in Washington and the field; 
4.	outstanding interpersonal and communication skills in order to function effectively across diverse cultures and development settings; 
5.	a proven solid technical grounding in the RDMA's emphasis areas including but not limited to trade, business and private sector development, environment, humanitarian assistance and work with activities serving vulnerable populations; and 
6.	flexibility and the ability to adapt to new and rapidly changing situations. 

An essential element in this assignment is the effective "coaching" and "mentoring" of the Mission's local staff and U.S. Direct Hire junior staff on USAID policies and procedures as well as the technical aspects of program planning and implementation. In addition, the incumbent must maintain effective and productive working relationships with other Embassy staff; with Washington counterparts; with other donors; and with the full range of USAID/RDMA's stakeholders and development partners, both inside and outside the government.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:  USAID/RDMA requires a Senior Program Advisor on a short-term, intermittent basis with considerable experience in USAID systems and procedures to assist PDO and RDMA staff in ensuring sound program planning, management, implementation, monitoring and assessment.   The LOE will not exceed more than 6 months to be utilized over a 12 month period.  The 6 month LOE could be split between RDMA's offices in Hanoi, Vietnam and Bangkok, Thailand.

Working under the broad supervision of the RDMA/PDO Director but exerting an important degree of independent judgment and initiative, the Program Advisor will play a major role in initiating new project development; establishing and maintaining monitoring systems; mentoring and advising RDMA staff; providing technical input into key elements of the program; coordinating with other donors as well as counterparts in both the government and private sector; and assisting in assorted program-related tasks, including planning, programming, implementing, budgeting and monitoring.

USAID/RDMA in both sites operates using a team approach.  With this in mind, the Program Advisor must demonstrate excellent communication and inter- personal skills.  Flexibility and a pragmatic, results-oriented approach are also essential.  Other requirements include sound judgment, cultural sensitivity and an ability to prioritize effectively and work well under pressure.  Like all other Mission staff, the Program Advisor will be expected to demonstrate flexibility and undertake a variety of both strategic and operational assignments. 

Specifically, the Program Advisor will undertake the following tasks:

Serve as a senior advisor for the Mission's technical teams: Ensure effective quality control and technical oversight while also ensuring adherence to USAID policies and procedures.  This will entail significant involvement in developing new activities, reviewing work plans, drafting correspondence, making strategic and tactical adjustments and assuring achievement of results.

Provide support across the full range of Mission activity: Prepare strategy statements, program and project documentation, including scopes of work, procurement plans, budgets, obligation schedules, program descriptions, requests for proposals/applications, Modified Acquisition and Assistance Request Documents (MAARDS), activity approval documents, Washington reports, briefing documents and other material.   Also, provide quality advice and recommendations on technical issues related to Mission's prospective future activities as well as the Mission's currently approved program objectives.  

Maintain effective program monitoring system: Take an active role in maintaining the Mission Performance Management Plans.  Also, assess, make recommendations, and assist in implementing the recommendations on ongoing program performance, possibly in part through site visits as well as regular discussions and consultations with RDMA key staff and stakeholders. 

Mentor USAID/RDMA and RDMA/Vietnam staff: Provide advice, guidance and on-the-job training across the full range of technical, administrative and procedural issues and activities as needed by RDMA staff as it relates to the planning and implementation of an effective USAID program in the region, as well as professional development for PDO staff.  

Advise USAID/RDMA Mission Director's Office: Provide strategic guidance, analysis, advice and recommendations to the RDMA front office on all aspects of ongoing or potential future RDMA activity in the region.  Also, provide similar inputs in discussions with members of Embassy country teams, other donors and counterparts, assuming responsibility on occasion for representing USAID in meetings and consultations involving the full range of donor-funded development activity in south Asia and the Pacific.

Undertake Other Activities as Appropriate: From time to time, the incumbent may be required to perform certain other duties relevant to this position that are not specifically described above.  Such additional duties as assigned by the RDMA/PDO Director or designee are considered inherent to the position as well as the smooth functioning of a results-oriented USAID Mission.

<RESPDATE>012508
<ARCHDATE>02242008
<CONTACT>Robert Valdes, (202) 385-6157
<DESC>Posting (Brief Abstract):  The following serves as an update to the FAA's public announcement dated 8/23/07 for Runway Status Lights (RWSL) system procurement. The following requirements for the anticipated procurement of the RWSL system remain unchanged: ýýý	Develop the source code required to enable the RWSL Processor to perform the RWSL light control functions and to interface with the existing surface surveillance system and the FLS,  ýýý	Installation of RWSL Field Lighting System (FLS) at designated airport runways/taxiways to include all necessary construction, ýýý	Integrate the RWSL Processor and RWSL FLS so as to achieve FAA standards applicable to a fully operational component of the NAS, ýýý	Develop, produce, and field test a RWSL prototype (First Article),  ýýý	Produce, deliver, and install a RWSL systems defined as a production deliverables,  ýýý	Provide logistics support including training development and engineering support. ýýý	 Utilize Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)hardware and software to the maximum extent possible The specific objectives of this public announcement are as follows: ýýý	To inform interested industry participants of the updated High Level Procurement Schedule for the RWSL system according to the following table;  Runway Status Lights Milestone	  Projected Completion Date Release Request for Offer (RFO)	  Mid-February 2008 Vendors' Submit Proposals	        Mid-April 2008 JRC Final Investment Decision	    Mid-June 2008 Contract Award	                   End of June 2008 ýýý	To provide the FAA's latest version of the RWSL Final Requirements Document (FRD) dated 11/30/07 herein attached.  ýýý	To provide an overview of the FAA's acquisition strategy for the procurement of the RWSL system as summarized below. The RWSL team's objective is to make a best value award for the RWSL system utilizing full and open competition. Replies received to the initial public announcement indicate that there is adequate industry interest in RWSL to enable the use of full and open competition.  There is sufficient data resulting from the ATO-P proof of concept prototypes currently in operation to demonstrate the viability of existing technology. Additionally, the FAA has made available to industry, via the initial RWSL Public Announcement posting, the RWSL High Level Systems Description, Preliminary Requirements Document, Engineering Brief, and Acquisition Schedule to share the FAA's insight into the operational requirements of RWSL.   The RWSL team's acquisition strategy is to acquire the RWSL three main components: software design, integration, and system logistics support (including IT hardware), RWSL FLS component installation at selected airport runways/taxiways, and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware procurement system through a single contract to one offeror. A formal SIR/RFO is scheduled for release in mid-February, 2008.  Offerors may be asked, as part of their RFO submission, to make an oral presentation entitled Operational Capability (OC) Briefing. In said briefing, industry participants responding to the RFO will describe their technical knowledge, experience, and program management capabilities they would apply to successfully fulfill this requirement. The RWSL team may use the OC as a source evaluation factor. The following four criteria may also be used as source evaluation factors. If identified as such, they will be evaluated as part of the OC oral presentation. Other factors may be included and will be specified as part of Section M of the RFO. Section L of the RFO will provide additional parameters for the preparation of the OC oral presentation. Potential criteria to be addressed in the OC briefing include but are not limited to the following: ýýý	Software development & integration capabilities (experience with software acquisition, development, and maintenance capabilities in open architecture development and modular design), demonstrated understanding of operational environment and safety applications, quality management,  ýýý	Experience with the conduct and management of airport runway construction/modification projects, and demonstrated understanding of operational environment and safety applications, quality management, and construction risk analysis. ýýý	Approach to maximizing the use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment to satisfy material requirements of RWSL ýýý	Utilization of small & small disadvantaged business concerns.   The following is a summary of the anticipated contract type the FAA RWSL team plans to use to procure the RWSL system: ýýý	Contract Type: Indefinite Quantity Contract utilizing individual Delivery Orders to authorize performance on selected contract line item numbers (CLINs) ýýý	Period of Performance (PoP): Not to exceed 5 years consisting of a base PoP of two years and three one-year options to the PoP.    ýýý	Total Estimated Contract Dollar Value: To Be Determined (TBD) not to exceed (NTE) $80M. This dollar amount represents a budget estimate only subject to adjustment predicated on the final number of airports to receive the RWSL system. Individually priced delivery orders will obligate funding for the specific CLINs being ordered. ýýý	Total Number of Airports Scheduled for RWSL Installation: Minimum of 21. Total number of airports may be increased from 21 to any number up to a total of 35. The PoP may be extended through the use of the aforementioned one-year options to accommodate the RWSL installation schedule and increase in the total number of airports where RWSL is to be installed. Anticipated CLINs (Final CLIN to be defined in RFO) and a corresponding description follow: o	0001, Software Design, Integration, and System Logistics Support for the RWSL Processor. This CLIN is anticipated to be a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) type to also include the training, documentation, support equipment, tools and supplies needed for FAA air traffic, airway facilities and site personnel to operate and maintain the system.  CLIN 0001 will be ordered via issuance of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery order for each RWSL system delivered as a production system after First Article (CLIN 0004) acceptance. CLIN 0001 will also be delivered as part of the First Article (CLIN 0004) as noted below.  If the POP of the contract is extended beyond the base period of two years, through option exercise, additional delivery orders may be placed during the option period. The FAA will require full and unrestricted data rights to any source code, algorithm, or derivative software (including firmware documentation of software & hardware and programming tools) developed as part of the systems integration portion of the RWSL requirement.  Offerors will be instructed to prepare their proposals to include data rights as part of their price. o	0002, Field Lighting System (FLS) installation. Anticipated CLIN is a Time & Materials type. This CLIN will define the in-pavement installation of the FLS equipment at the site. In addition, the contractor will perform the engineering site survey, prepare a site engineering report (SER), prepare a construction design specifications and obtain any construction and environmental permits necessary before the installation. FLS systems will be ordered via delivery orders during the base PoP, or option.  The construction will comply with all applicable codes, rules and regulations on the site as well as adhering to the AC 150/5370-2E, Operational Safety on Airports during Construction.  The contractor will provide for the entire life of the project an Airport Construction Coordinator (ACC) in sufficient numbers to cover all periods of time when construction activities take place within the Airport Operations Area (AOA) of the airport.   After the installation of the FLS, the contractor will provide required support during the airfield lighting testing and systems integration and interface testing of the RWSL processor. The Government will designate a Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) who will be responsible for evaluating the construction effort, assuring that it complies with all contract terms and conditions, and responsible for accepting the work as complete in behalf of the Government. o	0003, COTS (including lighting fixtures). The RWSL team will utilize a firm fixed price contract line item for the acquisition of the COTS hardware procurement (IT hardware, lighting fixtures, and ancillary equipment). The lighting system includes the in-pavement lights, airfield lighting control processor and constant current regulators (CCRs), master controllers and lighting computers. There are existing Advisory Circulars (AC) for airfield lighting that have established specification for the lights to mitigate developmental risk. Alternatively, the RWSL team will consider the feasibility of acquiring the COTS lighting fixtures utilizing existing contracts in place. The purchase of the lighting fixtures will, in turn, become Government-furnished equipment (GFE). o	0004, First Article (pre-production) of RWSL System at Designated Key Site. The RWSL team will specifically structure the First Article requirement to be procured as a complete system including: software design & integration (CLIN 0001), FLS installation (CLIN 0002), system testing in the factory, system testing at the site, on-site support of FAA Operational Testing (OT) and Independent Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E), all COTS (CLIN 0003), and incorporation of changes the FAA may require to the system as a result of OT and IOT&E.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) delivery order is proposed for the First Article (FA) system. The First Article system will include the training, documentation, support equipment, tools and supplies needed for FAA air traffic, airway facilities and site personnel to operate and maintain the system.  As stated above, the FAA will issue a SIR which will be the Request For Offer (RFO) anticipated in mid February, 2008. The RFO will include all four CLINs mentioned above. In order to enable maximum Government flexibility in its procurement approach the recommended Indefinite-Quantity contract instrument with options for extensions to the PoP will permit the issuance of delivery orders for any combination of CLINs 0001-0003. These contract provisions allow the FAA to leverage available program funding in the short term while allowing for the obligation of out-year funding as it becomes available.   The latest revised RWSL Statement of Work and Specifications Documents are scheduled to be completed in January, 2008 and will be made available in a subsequent public announcement.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR OFFER. NO RESPONSE IS HEREBY SOLICITED TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

<DESC>BAA Synopsis

FHWA will be posting a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to sponsor a systematic research and development program to eliminate/reduce the deteriorating effects of ASR in highway concrete structures even when exposed to adverse natural environment and/or additionally altered by the use of cost effective deicers/chemicals. The results from this research will directly support ongoing efforts to improve the durability of highway infrastructure including pavements, bridges, and other concrete highway structures. Although focused on highway structures, this research will explain the observed severe concrete deterioration which appears to be ASR due to applied deicing chemicals on some of the Nation?s airfields and hence provide a better understanding of ASR mechanisms and in turn prevent or reduce the severity of ASR. 

This program has been designated by section 5203(e) of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFTEA-LU). Congress authorized the use of funds for further development and deployment of techniques to prevent and mitigate ASR, including lithium based techniques, and assist states in inventorying existing structures having ASR problem. Recently FHWA initiated an Alkali-Silica Reactivity (ASR) Development and Deployment Program consistent with the requirements of SAFETEA-LU legislation. These deployment activities will initially focus on currently available technologies and methods for ASR identification and control, and pursue deployment of the products of the research provided for through this Broad Agency Announcement as they become available.

This BAA has four objectives and is intended to initiate additional developments in ASR technology through:

1. Advancing the fundamental understanding of the ASR mechanism and concrete deterioration process under a variety of service conditions through modeling of the ASR reaction in the presence of competing ions such as chlorides, deicers and other chemical species applied externally to the concrete surface. 

2. Developing reliable improved accelerated laboratory test methods. 

3. Developing reliable non-destructive field test methods) for evaluation of concrete structures.  

4. Identification of cost effective methods to control or mitigate ongoing concrete deterioration due to ASR. 

The BAA will be available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Interested parties may register at the aforementioned site to receive notice of its posting, as well as a variety of other related procurement announcements and notifications. It is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps website for any amendments to the BAA package.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. The Government is awarding purchase order N00164-08-P-0401 to RRE, Incorporated of Lady Lake, FL.  The scope of this contract covers the reinforcement and repair of case-to-cover seals on Submarine Valve Regulated Lead Acid (SVRLA) battery cells.  The reinforcement and repairs involve thermally bonding (also referred to as thermally ?welding?) a strip of thermoplastic material to the external joint between the case and cover of the battery cell.   This thermally welded strip is required to be a gas-tight seal of the case-to cover joint.  The purchase order was awarded under FAR 6.302-2 because delay in award for the majority of the quantities required under the purchase order would result in serious injury to the Government.  Thus, these quantities (770 cells) were exempt from the synopsis required by FAR 5.201 based on the exception under FAR 5.202(a)(2).  The Government has an additional, non-urgent requirement for the repair of 532 cells.  The Government intends to modify!   the existing purchase order with RRE, Incorporated to procure the repair of these additional cells based on FAR 6.302-1(a)(iii).  Thus, a separate Request For Quote will not be issued.  This announcement is for the purpose of complying with FAR 5.201(a) for the non-urgent 532 cells.  Government point of contact is Mr. J.D. Martin, Code 0564EF, at telephone 812-854-3723, Fax 812-854-3465 or e-mail:  james.d.martin@navy.mil  The mailing address is: Mr. J.D.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD) in Washington, DC intends to award a purchase order to Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors' Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) of New York, NY under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The purpose of this acquisition is to provide a follow-up workshop for investors and financial analysts to identify best practices for using climate-risk  disclosure information by companies to make investment and corporate governance decisions held in 2007. This project provides outreach to targeted investor organizations, supports research of best practices in this area, and convenes a workshop for large institutional investors that have long been  a target audience for EPA's ENERGY STAR program. This workshop provides CPPD with the unique opportunity to access and engage in a dialogue with members of the institutional investor community.  Under this order, CDP will conduct follow-up research into issues and best practices involving the use  of climate risk disclosure information and how voluntary initiatives are viewed by investors. This research will be used in a workshop presented in March 2008 and will coincide with the release of data collected by CDP. EPA will receive recognition of ENERGY STAR and other CPPD-sponsored voluntary  programs, contact lists, and a comprehensive report of key findings and recommendations. NO SOLICIATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. CDP is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement as it is the only known organization that has successfully managed a multinational,  multi-year financial disclosure of climate risk initiative and provides an unbiased platform for dialogue concerning voluntary activities and climate risk. CDP provides public access to its data and has successfully secured the endorsement of over 155 major financial organizations for their  initiative to increase the disclosure of relevant information regarding greenhouse gas emissions and its potential impact on shareholder value. No other organization is known to provide access and exposure to large institutional investors interested in climate risk. Notwithstanding, any firm that  believes it is capable of satisfying EPA's requirements may submit a written capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered. Reponses must be submitted in writing to Jami J. Rodgers, Contracting Officer, at rodgers.jami@epa.gov A  determination not to compete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Description

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Center for Professional Development, Inc (CPD) for this requirement. The estimated amount of this modification is $50,400.00.

This proposed procurement is for modification to an existing contractual agreement for a more detailed and in-depth independent assessment of organizational structure and culture within the Office of Regulatory Policy within Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/ Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). The existing contract was synopsized and posted on FBO under Contract Number HHSF223200730035C.

A study of the FDA drug safety program, conducted by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), recommended that improvements be made to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research?s (CDER) culture.  In that study, they recommended that external management consultants assist CDER to develop a comprehensive strategy to address issues identified in the study.  In September 2007, a contract for this work was awarded to the Center for Professional Development, Inc.  (HHSF223200730035C).  The contract focuses on CDER-wide culture issues and includes organizational design in the drug review and safety offices.
Based upon CDER current initiatives and implementation of the projects currently in place, having to recreate and re-initiate what CPD has already commenced would add additional costs to the government.  To try and duplicate this effort is not feasible given the types of organizational studies necessary and the time allotted for this effort to be performed.     It is in the best interest of the government to continue with the current contactor because of duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. FDA/CDER intends to issue a contract modification award for continued performance of specialized services to CPD, Inc.   The authority is FAR 6.302-1.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.   No solicitation will be issued.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.     E-Mail any inquiries to:  Roberta.richardson@fda.hhs.gov

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  Any formal solicitations will be announced separately.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI.  

PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION
The 77th Aeronautical Systems Group at Brooks City-Base, TX is seeking information from sources that are capable of providing a solution for the removal of stains on the new Air Force Sage Green Boot.  We anticipate using NAICS code 541490 for this project.  The small business size standard associated with this NAICS code is $6.5M.  All business sizes, to include small business and the sub-categories of small businesses, are being looked at during our market research phase.  

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION
	The current commercial sage green boot is used by the AF as a working & field boot.  The sage green boot is replacing the tan boot for the Airman's Battle Uniform (ABU).  The sage green boots will not hide many potential stains.  Air Force Uniform Program (AFUP) compiled data on stains that are of the biggest concern.  As a result AFUP is seeking information regarding industry available, stain repel-and-release finishes and cleaners.  This is not a solicitation, and no award will be made for this effort at this time.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  The Government holds the right to test any of the submissions.  All submissions must be Berry Amendment compliant.  Proposed solutions shall be currently available technologies.

FUNCTIONAL CONCERNS
	Types of stains encountered by the Airmen have a correlation to their functional daily tasks & responsibilities.  In Maintenance functions typical stain types include engine exhaust soot, tire break grime, fuel, deicing fluid, hydraulic fuel, mineral vegetable and ester based oils, and liquid oxygen.  In Field use Airmen reported sand stains, blood, grass stains, dirt stain, red clay, flare (orange/red), and muddy water as typical.  General staining in everyday "life" tasks such as eating and drinking are tomato, coffee, soda and juices.



TECHNICAL INFORMATION
	The 77th Aeronautical Systems Group requests test data results for each product.  Finish should not cause changes in shade, or near infra red spectral reflectance values as a result of application.  Use of Nano technology and other state of the art technologies encouraged.  Any available Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) sheets should also be forwarded.  Since this product will come in close proximity to the skin while in use, proof is required that no potential health issues are posed by the proposed remedy.
	If this fabrication is currently in use please note current applicable industry or military end uses as well as any known positive or negative feedback from current end uses. 
	 
If needed, request material(s) from an AAFES vendor.

Include in key points any additional benefits or risks, manufacturing constraints, effect of finishes on specified salient characteristics, any known health concerns, and associated MSDS information. 
	All boxes/packages submitted in response to this solicitation should be clearly marked with the following information:  the company name or identifier, the solicitation number, the number of the box per total boxes/packages shipped (such as 1 of 8) and the type of product contained within.

2.	 If you are a small business, would you consider submitting a proposal as a prime contractor?

3.	In what socio-economic programs do you now participate (e.g. Mentor Protege, Indian Incentive, etc.)?  What is the extent of your participation in these programs?  

4.	It is currently anticipated that up to 3 contract awards will result from this acquisition and that a portion of these awards will be reserved for small business. For small business consideration, would your firm be able to compete under NAICS 541490?  If not, why? Please provide your recommendations concerning the anticipated number of contract awards, how many contracts should be reserved for small business, and the proposed NAICS.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has developed and demonstrated a juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system (JSATS) consisting of acoustic micro-transmitters (tags) and autonomous and cabled acoustic receivers that meet its needs for evaluati ng the survival of juvenile salmonids migrating through the Columbia River Federal Hydropower System.   Cabled receivers have been deployed at large hydro-electric dams for determining specific route of passage for migrating juvenile salmon.  These receive rs consist of four hydrophones and four cables with each hydrophone and cable pair carrying the signals generated by sound incident on each hydrophone to a computer.  This acoustic system has a center frequency at 416.7 KHz.  The hydrophones consist of a p iezoelectric element, shielded amplifier, and non-conductive case; the assembly able to withstand and function at static pressure up to 600K Pa absolute.  Specifications for hydrophone directivity and receive sensitivity at 416.7 KHz TBD. Present estimate of minimum acceptable (on axis) receive sensitivity at the indicated frequency is -200 dBV//?Pa.  To meet the requirements of 2008 juvenile salmon research study plans beginning in Mid-April, the USACE will be soliciting for hydrophone assemblies specific to this frequency and that meet its specification requirements. This solicitation (RFQ) outlining these specifications will be posted on/or about 18 January, 2008.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for proposal.  <BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, CENWW-CT, 201 N. 3rd, Walla Walla, WA 99362, intends to issue a sole source contract with the University of Idaho to conduct an a dult behavior and passage study on Chinook and Steelhead during the entire spring and summer spill season in 2008.  The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this requirement, 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(b), and implemented b y FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may resul t in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencies requirements. <BR><BR>This work requires highly specialized expertise in adult salmon and steelhead handling, tagging, and tracking with telemetry to provide information on migration characteristics and s urvival of adult fish as they approach and pass Little Goose Dam.  These services include determining the dam approach paths, movements in the tailrace, and ladder entrance approach and passage of adult spring Chinook salmon and Steelhead through the adult  fish ladders at Little Goose Dam relative to dam operations and river conditions.  The required services also include the analysis and conversion of data for further evaluation and correlation to seasonal, operational, structural and other experimental co nditions as defined by the District. <BR><BR>The Little Goose evaluation requires the ability of a contractor to obtain the necessary Endangered Species Act permits from NOAA Fisheries to handle adult salmon and steelhead.  If a contractor with no history of handling and tagging adult Columbia and Snake River ESA listed stocks were to apply for an ESA permit, the process would take approximately 6 - 8 months for the permit alone, resulting in a delay of six to eight weeks and subsequent loss of data for spr ing-migrating adults.  This delay is unacceptable and would not meet the needs of the government for this study.   The contract proposed period of performance is for 16 months.  <BR>If there are sources who feel they are able to perform the requirement, th ey must respond by submitting the following information.<BR><BR>"	Provide proof that they hold permits from NOAA Fisheries to handle adult salmon and steelhead.<BR><BR>"	Present verification that they conducted successful radio telemetry or other similar ( e.g. acoustic tag) research on adult salmonids on the mainstem Columbia and/or Snake Rivers in at least 4 of the last 10 years.   Acceptable verification should include at a minimum two letters from past clients on company/agency letterhead, and/or a minim um of three samples of professional reports describing the contractors data and results that were published in professional journals or accepted by the Corps of Engineers or other salmon management agency involved with Columbia or Snake River stocks.    < BR>  <BR>"	Demonstrate their ability to operate and maintain the adult fish trap at Ice Harbor Dam, and be capable of installing and maintaining all cable, antennas, buoys, or other necessary equipment at Little Goose Dam.<BR><BR>The information obtained w ill be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  The NAICS code is 541712 with a Size Standard of 500 employees.<BR><BR>Any firm that belie ves it is capable of satisfying these requirements may contact Ms. Carol Stimmel at 509-527-7207 for information and submission of required documents. This announcement is based on the best information available and may be subject to future modification.

The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 SMART servers, along with these other components, have been identified as key components of the Departmentýs SMART server infrastructure.   IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified networks.   These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.   As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed. Furthermore, these setups are matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs.  Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economies of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost.  Required Hewlett Packard DL380G5, Hewlett Packard DL580 G4, servers, and related infrastructure equipment (described above and in the attached) are required for SMART. These servers have been identified as key components of the Departmentýs SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.<BR><BR>Repost reason: updated updated cable, rack, and other part numbers in lines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.<BR><BR>

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled LANDING SENSOR ADVANCED COMPONENT TECHNOLOGIES NRA-NNL08ZD2001N which was posted on December 5, 2007. You are notified that the following questions were received for which answers are provided: Q1.  Is the primary purpose to extend conventional or state-of-the-art 2D image and signal processing techniques to 3D images for enhanced spatial (depth) resolution?    A2.  YES  Q2.  Does/can the scope include any of the following?   - Composite 3D model (terrain) building - Segmentation, Region of Interest (ROI) management, or foveation - Hazard assessment or target recognition - Path planning or re-targeting - Velocity, range or altitude estimation (beyond GSD estimation) A2.  NO Q3.  Should the system be targeted for an embedded environment even at TRL 3/4?   A3.  YES  Q4.  Can one propose a system-level ALHAT solution, or are responses constrained to the technologies described in Appendix A- Solicited Component and Subsystem-level Technologies?   A4.  System-level ALHAT solutions are not of interest under this NRA.  As stated in the NRA, ?The purpose of this NRA is to solicit partners to research, develop, and demonstrate component- and subsystem-level technologies specifically related to ALHAT that will increase performance, reduce risk, cost, size, and mass of a state of the art sensor capable of enabling a descent vehicle to autonomously perform a safe and accurate landing. The basic technology chosen for this sensor is flash LIDAR. Flash LIDAR provides a 3-D imaging capability which can be exploited to generate the necessary information for accurate navigation by implementation of appropriate real time signal and/or image processing techniques. The goal is to advance the core sensor component technologies to a technology readiness level that enables their eventual infusion into future space flight missions.? Q5.   Are we required to develop detectors that covers the whole 1 - 2 um band (ref. technology topic area 1, pg. 12)?  Are specific bands more beneficial than others (match laser wavelength)?    A5.   No.  1-2 um is the spectral range of interest for technology development.       Q6.  Is the 256 x 256 pixel format the end goal or is it the starting point?   A6.  It is the goal as stated in topic area 1.	  Q7. In technology topic 2 (ROIC objectives), there is a dynamic range specification of 14 bits. Is this associated with a time or amplitude (intensity) quantity?   A7.  Dynamic Range refers to amplitude.   The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/LaRC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=23  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.

<DESC>A001 is posted to respond to the following question(s):

Question:

I would like to ask a question about the USTDA's RFQ for the Definitional Mission related to the Minas Gerais state government's data center.  Item 1.5 of the RFQ suggests that all deliverables under the contract must be delivered to the Contracting Officer's Technical  
Representative (COTR) on or about March 12, 2008.  Is this correct?    

Response: The deliverables due date is correct.  All required reports are due on or about 03/12/08.

Question:

The RFQ then states in 1.5 that "The Period of Performance for this contract shall be one year from the date of the Contracting Officer's signature on the contract."

Response: The period of performance is correct as stated.  The March deliverable date is the date a final report is due to USTDA.  Should, and often the case is that, the report needs further clarification, or as is often the case, travel, contacts or other external issues preclude meeting the March deliverables date. With a deliverables date and period of performance ending date; the contract does not need to have a change in scope modification (changes clause).  The contract is modified to simply change the deliverables due date and the date change is not a change in scope (also called a cardinal) change.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the submission date of market research material, provide answers to the questions submitted, and amend two service areas.

The submission date for all market research materials has been changed from: 2:00 PM (EST) January 11, 2008 to: 2:00 PM (EST) January 18, 2008.  Any submissions received prior to this amendment will be retained unless return is requested.  

The following answers are provided to the questions received prior to January 3, 2008:

Question 1:  What are the main reasons for conducting a provider search? 
Answer:  As part of a due diligence review of plan administration and fees OTS is conducting the market research to insure that they are receiving the most favorable fees for administration of their plan.

Question 2:  Please define ?Best Value Methodology?. 
Answer: Best Value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government?s estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.

Question 3:  What do you mean by ?Development? under the Client Services section titled ?Development, implementation and operation of a paperless participant transactions system??? 
Answer:  OTS wants the company to provide demonstrated experience in the development, implementation and operation of a paperless participant transaction system.  The company should have participated in the development of the paperless system, part of their integrated package.

Question 4:  Is there any aspect of plan administration and management that OTS would like to maintain in a non-paperless form? 
Answer:  Yes

Question 5:  Is the incumbent record keeper (Pentegra) precluded from participating in any future RFP that may be issued? 
Answer:  No

Question 6:  What are the education goals for OTS?  
Answer:  The education goals are vendor outreach to familiarize new enrollees to the risks associated with portfolio funds offered, identify areas where plan doesn?t measure up to benchmark of plans for size.

Question 7:  Is OTS seeking a financial advisor or is there interest in an electronic advisory service?  Can you provide more specific detailed information? 
Answer:  OTS is not seeking a financial advisor.  OTS may decide as a result of this market research that we desire electronic advisory services and, if so, will include the requirement in the RFP.

Question 8:  What is the definition of a ?fully-integrated? record keeping platform?
Answer:  OTS is defining ?fully integrated? record keeping platform to include recordkeeping, administration, trustee services and service technology (web site, voice response and call center). 

Question 9:  Does OTS have any interest in expanding the current Index Fund platform or adding actively managed mutual funds?  
Answer:  Yes, OTS is interested in expanding its portfolio to include actively managed funds at this time.   

Question 10:  Are there any other registrations, documents or other requirements that our company needs to submit or meet along with our technical information submission?
Answer: No, not at this time.  If OTS decides to go forward with a Request for Proposal (RFP) and such information is required, the requirements will be clearly spelled out in the RFP.

Question 11:  Could you please provide information on the types of participant communications that have worked well/not worked well in the past (e.g., electronic, face-to-face, and written)?  
Answer:  OTS will not provide types of participant communications that have worked well/not worked well in the past (e.g., face to face, and written) at this time.  If an RFP is issued, and OTS determines this information would be beneficial to all offerors, the information will be included in the RFP.

Question 12:  What are your current communications goals and objectives (e.g., improving participant investment knowledge, increasing participant contributions, increasing participant level diversification)?  
Answer:  See question and answer #6.

Question 13:  During the RFI/RFQ stage, we only received asset classes for the various investment options.  Could you please provide additional information such as current expense ratios and ticker symbols for the plan's investments?  
Answer:  No
Question 14:  Language in the solicitation states "Financial Advisors are not eligible to participate in this market research".  Is it possible that in a follow-on, or related solicitation, Financial Advisors would be eligible to participate?  And additionally, to your knowledge, has the Dept. of Treasury had many solicitation requests wherein Financial Advisors were eligible to participate?  
Answer:  OTS does not anticipate a follow-on or related solicitation for the services of a Financial Advisor.  OTS is not aware of any Department of Treasury solicitation requests that have allowed Financial Advisors to participate.  

Question 14a:  I am seeking clarification for I am a Financial Advisor with experience and training and would be interested in contracting my skills; with my current employer's authorization, for the requirements of solicitations eligible to Financial Advisors.  Other FedBizOpps contract solicitations seek Financial Advisors for their expertise, training, and certification; I am trying to understand if this is the case with perhaps other Treasury solicitations.  
Answer:  OTS does not have any knowledge of other Treasury solicitations.
Question 15:   Is the procurement process for this bid subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)?  
Answer:  Yes

Question 16:  Is the selected vendor required to meet Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) or Affirmative Action standards?  
Answer:  Any resultant RFP will include the following clauses: FAR 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity; FAR 52.221-21-Prohibitin of Segregated Facilites; 52.222-22 Previous Contracts and Compliance Reports, 52.222-24, Preaward On-Site Equal Opportunity Compliance Evaluations, and 52.222-25, Affirmative Action Compliance. 

Question 17:  Does the Office of the Thrift Supervisions have any required contract elements or language that we should be aware of?  
Answer:  The RFP, if issued, will contain all contract elements and specific language. 

Question 18:  Are there any unique plan provisions or services required in administering the plan?  
Answer:  No

Question 19:  Would it be possible to provide a copy of the plan document and SPDs?  Answer:  The plan document will be provided in the RFP if issued.  A draft copy of the SPD is provided as attachment.

Question 20:  What is the annual net cash flow in to the plan?  
Answer:  The annual net case flow for 2007 was $4.3M.

Question 21:  Is OTS researching the market regarding plan administrative services only, or are the Plan?s investments also under consideration?
Answer:  OTS is researching the market for both plan administrative services and investment line up.  

Question 22:  Please provide more information on the after-tax savings account mentioned in the Description.
Answer:  The after tax savings account is an account that employees can save on a post tax basis and interest accrues tax free until the time of withdrawal.  

Question 23:  Is there an employer matching contribution?  
Answer:  Yes.

Question 24:  Please confirm whether the OTS Plan is exempt from ERISA.
Answer:  No, it is not.

Question 25:  Does OTS offer any other defined contribution or defined benefit plans to its employees?
Answer:  Yes, OTS offers the government wide Thrift Savings Plan, as well as the government defined benefits plans and a private defined benefit plan to a select group of employees.

Question 26:  Are all employees located in the D.C. area, or are employees based in other locations?
Answer:  OTS employees are based in DC as well as five regional locations.

Question 27:  Does the OTS plan currently have a Roth 401(k), or is this feature under consideration?
Answer:  OTS adopted the Roth 401(k) under its current provider in 2007.

Question 28:  Please describe the current level of on-site education.
Answer:  Information is provided to participants via the provider?s website and the incumbent will come to an OTS site as required.  

Question 29:  What is the anticipated timeline for review and results of the market research, and any subsequent action (e.g. RFP)? 
Answer:   If an RFP is issued, we anticipate the RFP release sometime during the first quarter of 2008.

The text of the synopsis shall be changed as follows:

REMOVE:  Current portfolio has no less than 20 plans with a minimum of $250 million in assets.  

REPLACE WITH: Current portfolio has no less than 20 plans with a minimum of $250M each in assets or multiple employer plans with cumulative assets of $3 B.

<DESC>Re-posted. Original posting was under incorrect class code.<BR><BR>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment fac ilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Phlebotomy. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care acr oss the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program.< BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution an d Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. T his RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreemen t (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is November 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Compa ny and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determ ined utilizing best value/trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this eve nt, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR><BR>Point of Contact<BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR>   <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>T he Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety Phlebotomy, which at a minimum includes the high volume line items below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $37,965. This forecast i s based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project include:<BR><BR>Needle Blood Collection 21 gauge Eclipse; PKG DESCRIPTION: 48 EA/BX/10 BX/CS; Delivered Qty 178; Extended Price $30,2 85.<BR><BR>At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types, a nd packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone N umber, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the specified clo sing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, on-site in-person in-servicing, product literature, education and training materials, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors ar e strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email. Each submitting vend or is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. <BR> <BR>The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical an d/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Add itionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. <BR><BR><BR>Phase I: Technical/Company Evaluation Process<BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-ma iling their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses t o the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criter ia, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. <BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: generally, responses to all questions in this section  demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or pr oducts and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor h as, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all  products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor  from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendor must  manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Safety Phlebotomy Devices. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract  statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, the following items are required: <BR>a.	Safety Phlebotomy Device  21 gauge needle.<BR>Provide certification of all brands of this product lin e that you manufacturer or distribute with the initial submittal.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Safety Phlebotomy product line. Provided the DAPA number or proof of the application process with th e initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Regi on and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified). <BR>4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardiza tion initiative. (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy pricing quotes and competitive product cross-reference in electronic MS Excel format upon request.<BR>6 .	Vendor must provide educational tools, product literature, and materials for Safety Phlebotomy as well as no cost samples for the evaluation. Describe your available company educational tools and material resources with the initial submittal.<BR>7.	Vendo r must provide customer service (telephonic and e-mail) for regional facilities. Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial submittal.<BR>8.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region. Provide  contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submittal.<BR>9.	Vendor is required to provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to Tripler Army Medical Center prior to the clinical evaluation. Vendors, who cannot provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to TAMC, prior to the clinical evaluation, will be disqualified.<BR>10.	Vendor is required to provide product literature, training aids, and teaching materials prior to the clinical evaluation to 18th MDG Kadena, Nav al Health Clinic Pearl Harbor, NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, NH Okinawa, and the 121st CSH Korea. Vendors, who cannot provide product literature, training aids, and teaching materials to these MTFs, prior to the clinical evaluations, will be disqualified.<BR>11.	V endors product line must be latex free and indicated on the packaging and in the product literature. <BR>12.	Vendor will provide a product with an easily identifiable safety feature.<BR>13.	Vendor will provide a product whereby the activation of the safet y feature (mechanism) will not allow for reuse of the product.<BR>14.	Vendor will provide a device with an active safety mechanism; the safety mechanism cannot be accidentally deployed.<BR>15.	Vendor will provide a device, which can be activated by one han d.<BR>16.	Vendor will provide a product and packaging which clearly displays the size of the device.<BR><BR>Phase II: Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process<BR>The multi-disciplinary TPRB Clinical Team will request samples (no charge) from the product lin e to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery. Samples mu st be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4:00 p.m. local time, on the (21st ) calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadlin e will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. <BR><BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) = strongly disagree, Two (2) = disagree, Three (3) = neutral, Four (4) = agree, and Five (5) = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. <BR><BR>To determine acceptability, the TPRB Clinical Team comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate th e products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB Clinical Team intends to conduct the clinical evaluation in a clinical and/or non-clinical The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. <BR><BR>All vendors will be required to provide an on-site, in-person in-service to Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), prior to the use of their products. Failure to provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to TAMC will result in exclusion from the s tandardization process. The TPRBs support and TAMCs rationale for in-servicing of this product group is in compliance with the Association of Peri Operative Registered Nurses Position Statement The role of the health care industry representative in the perioperative/invasive procedure setting (AORN Recommended practices and Guidelines, 2007). In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary.<BR><BR>All vendors will be required to provide training materials to Nava l Hospital Yokosuka, Naval Hospital Okinawa, Naval Hospital Guam, 18th MDG Kadena, Naval Health Clinic Hawaii, and the 121 CSH. These training aides will address the safe and acceptable method of using the device. The training/guidance materials may be in the form of a DVD, product literature or other instructional methods that the vendor believes will assist the clinician. These training items must arrive prior to the clinical evaluation period. Failure to provide training/instructional materials will resu lt in exclusion from the standardization process. The clinical representatives, on the TPRB, from NH Guam, NH Okinawa, NH Yokosuka, 18th MDG Kadena, Naval Health Clinic Hawaii, and  121st CSH opted to exercise this option for the training and guidance of t he clinicians who will use the samples. This option is another method used to support the government's minimum need and is normal and customary.<BR><BR>Clinical evaluation process for Tripler Army Medical Center: Each vendor will provide on-site, in-person , in-servicing for a period of one week to TAMC clinical staff. One vendor per week. The TPRB Clinician will coordinate the scheduling and location of the presentations. This individual will work with the vendors in scheduling the training activities. Day 1: vendor will provide in-servicing to the staff. A presentation reviewing the technical aspects of the device, the indications for use of the device, and how to use the device will be addressed. Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. The vendor will be available for any questions, consultations, or guidance regarding the product. All vendors will be required to meet the standards of conduct in accordance with facility policies, local, state, and federal regulations.<BR><BR>Clinical evaluation pro cess for Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Naval Hospital Okinawa, Naval Hospital Guam, 18th MDG Kadena, Naval Health Clinic Hawaii, and the 121 CSH. Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and teaching material prior to the clinical evaluation.  The Pacific Region TPRB clinical representative, from each of these MTFs, will select the appropriate providers for this evaluation. They will proctor and monitor the clinical evaluation process. Day 1: the staff will review all literature and teaching ai des provided by a vendor. Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. Vendors will be available by telephone for questions, consultations, and guidance.<BR ><BR>The following Clinical/Performance evaluation criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	The vena-puncture needle is sharp and does not damage skin. (Penetrates skin evenly does not tear skin or leave jagged skin edg es)<BR><BR>2.	The safety device does not interfere with the intended use. (Safety mechanism does not  prevent the introduction of the needle through the skin and vein wall, does not impede the flash back of blood or the blood flow into the collection conta iner.)<BR><BR>3.	Once the safety mechanism is activated, no part of the needle is accessible. (Once activated, the safety sleeve, sheath or covering completely covers the needle  eliminating potential for reuse of needle)<BR><BR>Phase III: Pricing Analysi s Process<BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors who participated in the clinical/performance evaluation will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) base d on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement. Vendors will be provided seven calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) 7th calendar d ay. Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor o r vendor(s), without discussions as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary. <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heav ily than price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possibl e one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4)  Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor (line item review of the current usage in the region against what is being offered). Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is consider ed more important than other pricing elements.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>Question:<BR><BR>             Specifically, what is unit price?  Is tuition per student an allowable line item?  <BR><BR> <BR><BR>      Response:<BR><BR>              Pricing for the program is the affiliated College or University's prerogative.  How ever, we feel that the pricing per student is an affiliation fee and is not generally considered tuition because students will not be attending classes on site at the College/University, since the Government provides all classroom space/facilities, textboo ks, instructors, etc.  Our intent is to be considered a satellite extension of the College/University.  Additionally, the price may be based on a cost per student such as for example, associated administrative costs per student that accrue for the period o f time that the contract is in effect.  Although the solicitation and any resulting contract has a period of performance that is set, once a student enters the program and is paid for by the Government, the contract remains in force until the student gradu ates or is removed. Finally, the unit price is the cost for the affiliation per student and is submitted on the schedule in the solicitation with your proposal. <BR>

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Service, Division of Acquisition Management, on behalf of the Indian Health Service (IHS), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Fibergate, Inc., 6076 Franconia Road, Suite C, Alexandria, VA, 22310-1719.  The award will be for one year with two option years at a price not to exceed $100,000 inclusive of options.  The services being acquired are lease renewal and maintenance of two pairs of dark fiber between 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD and 12300 Twinbrook Parkway, Rockville, MD, one pair is a diverse path for redundancy.  

These fiber pairs, which run over diverse paths for the purpose of continuity of operations, support all business systems throughout IHS.  They provide all connectivity to the Internet, the IHS Wide Area Network, and the HHS Network.  These connections are critical as they provide access to all IHS business systems outside of the headquarters location and HHS Enterprise applications such as HHS Enterprise Email, the Unified Financial Management System, and other E-Gov applications and future initiatives.

This acquisition is being conducted on a sole-source basis because Fibergate, Inc., is the only company that has the fiber infrastructure to provide local area network speed connectivity to IHS.  Fibergate, Inc., is a licensed utility company in Maryland and it owns the fiber optic cable connection between 5600 Fishers Lane and 12300 Twinbrook Parkway.

This simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source.  Interested concerns may identify their interest in and capability to satisfy the requirement within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice.  Capability statements may be submitted to Anthony Webb, Room 5-101, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, or vial email at awebb@psc.gov.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) Facilities Engineering and Operations Division, Model Shop (Code 51054) is responsible for supporting the Hydromechanics departments by providing rapid prototype parts in a timely fashion.  These parts impact the design and testing of Navy surface ships, submarines, and advanced craft and so it is essential that required parts be accurate and provided with quick turn-around time. To support this effort NSWCCD intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) for services and supplies required to provide rapid prototype parts. The following are the required build capabilities which include but are not limited to SLS (Selective Laser Sintering),SLA (Stereolithography), FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling), Urethane Casting, Injection Molding and Metal Casting (investment casting and plaster/sand casting). The required tolerances are SLA:  +/- (0.005 in + 0.001 in/in); SLS:  +/- (0.010 in + 0.0015 in/in);FDM:  +/- (0.005 + 0.002 in/in); Urethane Casting:  +/- (0.010 + 0.0015 in/in); Injection Molding (overall):  +/- (0.010 + 0.002 in/in); Metal Casting:  +/- (0.010 + 0.002 in/in). Typical materials used for producing the parts may include but are not limited to SOMOS 11120 (resin for SLA); PA 3200 GF (powder for SLS); Aluminum, Zinc, Iron, and Steel (for Metal Casting - Investment); Aluminum, Zinc, Iron, Magnesium, and Steel (for Metal Casting - Plaster),SOMOS 9120,SOMOS 12120, SOMOS 14120, ACCURA Bluestone, ACCURA 40, accuGen100 SL, accuDur 100 SL. All BPA call/orders are generally competed among the BPA holders using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures. BPA holders must be capable of receiving and responding to   RFQ's electronically. An award will be issued as a Blanket Purchase Agreement Call (BPAC). BPA call/orders will not exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. BPA vendors must accept credit card as method of payment. The BPA's will have a period of performance of 5 years. In accordance with FAR 13.303-6, the government will review the BPA at least annually. The Government reserves the right to cancel any contractor's BPA for any reason, including but not limited to: poor performance, failure to respond to requests for quotes, vendor's prices are determined to be no longer competitive.  BPA's will be awarded on the basis of technical capabilities and past performance. Interested vendors should provide a capabilities statement and a minimum of four (4) past performance references. The capabilities statement must demonstrate the vendor's ability to fulfill the government's requirement and should include the types of machines that will be utilized. References should include name of business, address, phone number, point of contact, contract/purchase order number, and name of item. The government will evaluate the past performance via surveys of the references. Past Performance will be evaluated based upon Product Quality, Timeliness, Customer Satisfaction, and Reliability. Vendors who satisfactorily demonstrate their ability to fulfill the government's requirement and have a history of satisfactory past performance or better will be considered for award. The government reserves the right to use additional past performance references if available.

This is a Sources Sought announcement only.  This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the 55th Contracting Squadron to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.  

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:  This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing weather and weather systems training, development of training materials and tools, continuing education systems support training, website development and maintenance, and installing upgrades to the Air Force Weather (AFW) standard information systems at Operational Weather Squadrons (OWS) located in the Continental United States (CONUS), Hawaii, and the Weather Schoolhouse (335 RSS/UOA) located on Keesler AFB, Mississippi.  Systems support includes the development and maintenance of websites essential to the dissemination of weather information to Air Force, Army, Guard, Reserve, and other supported forces.  Training includes providing classroom and on-the-job instruction essential for new AFW personnel to develop the necessary skills required to analyze and apply weather data effectively.  The training provided at each OWS is driven by actual requirements and the needs of the trainee.  Examples of the AFW standard information systems include the local area network, the OWS Production System II (OPS-II), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Portal (NOAAPort), the Open Principal User Processor Operation (OPUP), the Weather Product Management Distribution Systems (WPMDS), the Watches, Warning, and Advisories Management System (WWAMS), and associated databases and Air Force Weather Weapons Systems hardware/software.

<DESC>The United States Government, for the purposes of market research, is seeking industry feedback on a draft Performance Description (PD) for live fire training equipment consisting of a control system and various types of target mechanisms (TMs) with contact and non-contact hit sensing capabilities. Non Contact Hit Sensors (NCHSs) will be able to detect where rounds hit or miss the target without the round actually making contact with the target. The Contact Hit Sensor (CHS) will detect and record hits  from rounds that physically contact the target installed on the TM. The hit sensors, in coordination with the TMs and control system, will be able to provide immediate, automated feedback to the firing line and control tower. Ranges will utilize existing equipment offered by vendors with minor modifications allowed to support the needs of the military. All equipment installed under this PD will be used for training conducted day and night. Vendors interested in receiving a copy of the DRAFT PERFORMANCE DES CRIPTION (PD) for Live Fire Training Ranges with Non Contact Hit Sensing and Contact Hit Sensing Capabilities, may do so by e-mailing a request to Gregg Johnson, Contract Specialist, AMSTA-LC-WSK-A, TACOM-Rock Island, at gregory.johnson23@us.army.mil with cc to Aaron Stetson, General Engineer, AMSTA-LC-WSM-T, TACOM-Rock Island, at aaron.stetson@us.army.mil.

COE is considering revising the contract terms and conditions in order to incorporate appropriate relocation industry best practices to provide quality r elocation services for transferring civilian employees of the Department of Defense. COE is considering a number of program/contract provisions and seeks relocation industry response and recommendations to consider in developing the contract specifications  and requirements.  The estimated annual volume is 1200-1500 homesale service authorizations in locations throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and possessions and territories.  This estimate may increase or decrease.<BR> <BR>1.	COEs goal is to maxim ize the number of Buyer Value Option (BVO) and Amended Value Sales. Please comment on or list relocation program guidelines or enhancements that could be considered to support increased BVO/Amended Value Sales.<BR>	<BR>2.	DoDs current relocation program r equires 60 days mandatory marketing prior to acceptance of appraised value offer. Many DoD employees homes are listed prior to employees authorization for home sale services, and some listing brokers are reluctant to agree to insert the relocation Exclus ion Clause after the fact. Would your company agree to continue to list the property with the employees broker for a period after acquisition as an incentive for inserting the clause? If so, for how long?   In your opinion, what would be the effect includ ing  a referral fee agreement as part of the Exclusion Clause if the contractor agrees to list the property with the transferees broker for a specified period after acquisition by the relocation management company?  <BR>		<BR>3.	Pricing: COE is considerin g different pricing options for Appraised Value Sales, including <BR>	- single fee for all Appraised Value Sale homes <BR>	- price range category fees<BR>	- geographic pricing (region or state)<BR>	- combination geographic and price range<BR>	Please commen t on these options and indicate which are most or least preferable for contractors, and why.  Please also recommend any additional pricing approach that could be considered within federal firm fixed price guidelines.<BR>	<BR>4.	Single or Multiple suppliers : Please indicate your preference for single or multiple supplier contracts and why. If a multiple supplier contract is preferred, what should be the basis for allocation of service authorizations?<BR>	<BR>5.	Billing rate redetermination basis: COE is cons idering utilizing a billing rate redetermination basis that is reflective of and responsive to national real estate market conditions, and that will enable appraised value sale billing rates to increase/decrease in correlation with market changes. Indices being considered include changes in number of months of supply of existing (unsold) homes as reported by National Association of Realtors (NAR) and national mon thly average interest rate on 30 year mortgages as compiled monthly by Freddie Mac. Please comment on these or other recommended bases for billing rate redetermination calculation. Data should be regularly reported, objective, national financial or economi c indicators that track or reflect real estate market conditions.  Please indicate preferences for frequency and methodology for billing rate re-determinations.<BR>	<BR>6.	Other recommendations: Please recommend any other contract options for COE considera tion that would improve services or facilitate contractor participation in the DoD Employee Relocation Program (DNRP).<BR>

<DESC>Project Description This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is seeking statistical sampling services in the area of Accounts Payable accrual, in accordance with the following Statement of Work: Statement of Work The Contractor will provide all materials, labor and equipment to provide and/or validate a sampling plan, which satisfies the sampling requirement of the Office of the Inspector General and KPMG, in support of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 financial statement audit.  The sampling methodology will be determined by the Contractor to provide the smallest sample possible while covering the entire population. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) will accrue a liability amount for FY 2008 based on a three-year historical analysis of actual invoices processed in the accounting system reflecting an invoice date within the first 45 days of the respective fiscal year.  These invoices are examined to determine which FY the goods and services were received.  For example, invoices dated from 10/1/05 to 11/15/05 may represent liabilities for FY 2005 or FY 2006 but were not paid until FY 2006 or later.  In previous years, BIA has worked in conjunction with a Contractor to establish an accepted methodology relating to the Accounts Payable (AP) accrual.  This statement of work defines the work required to build upon the three year trend by sampling the most current fiscal year and combining the results into the methodology.  This work involved shall proceed as follows: ?	The Contractor will be supplied with an electronic file of payments made during FY 2007 no later than January 28th 2008.  Within seven calendar days of receiving the electronic file the Contractor must provide BIA with the stratified sample as consistent with the methodology used in the FY 2006 sample. ?	BIA will then pull the sampled items and review them to determine which fiscal year the goods and services belong.  Results of the BIA review will be submitted to the Contractor no later than noon on March 24th, 2008. The contractor must then merge this data with the data produced in the FY 2007 accrual process to assimilate a complete three fiscal year analysis, culminating with a final projection that will be used in the FY 2008 accrual.

<SUBJECT>A -- Collaborations for Development of EPA?s Web-ICE Toxicity Estimation Tool
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-450-A-08
<RESPDATE>020808
<ARCHDATE>02102008
<CONTACT>Kathleen Graham, Coordinator, FTTA Program, Phone 202-564-2678, Email graham.kathleen@epa.gov
<DESC>Opportunity: 
The EPA is interested in finding partners for collaboration on a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to expand the development of its Web-ICE research program for predicting the toxicity of environmental chemicals. Researchers at the Office of Research and Development (ORD) of EPA are developing Web-ICE as a predictive tool to extrapolate acute toxicity data from surrogate species to endangered species and other taxa with limited test data. These hazard predictions can provide EPA's regulatory programs with science-based information that is helpful in prioritizing chemicals for more detailed toxicological evaluations, and therefore lead to more efficient collection and use of animal test data. Partnering opportunities with EPA exist to expand the breadth of toxicity data and interspecies correlation models as described below.
 
To indicate interest: Please reply to Francis Richards at richards.frances@epa.gov AND Ray Wilhour at wilhour.ray@epa.gov by March 1, 2008 if you are interested in partnering on this CRADA (Please use the attachment entitled "Interested Parties Response" to indicate your interest. For more information on CRADAs please see the website: http://www.epa.gov/osp/ftta.htm. Scientific questions should be directed to Dr. Mace Barron at 850-934-9223 or email at barron.mace@epa.gov. 

Overview: 
Across EPA programs, there are thousands of environmental chemicals for which limited or insufficient data are available for hazard and risk assessments. These chemicals include antimicrobial agents, inert pesticide ingredients, high-production-volume chemicals, and other organic and inorganic chemicals. Web-ICE is a toxicity estimation tool that currently allows extrapolation between aquatic invertebrates and fish, or between wildlife species (birds and mammals).

This three-year effort is divided into three phases. In Phase 1, available acute toxicity data will be compiled from a diversity of sources and evaluated for conformance to quality criteria.  Data of interest will include acute toxicity data for terrestrial plants, soil invertebrates, wildlife, and standard mammalian laboratory test species.  In Phase 2, interspecies correlation models will be developed and validated for extrapolation between species of terrestrial plants, between species of soil invertebrates, and between wildlife and standard mammalian laboratory test species. In Phase 3, Web-ICE modules will be developed to expand this internet based tool for toxicity prediction and the generation of species sensitivity distributions for terrestrial plants and soil invertebrates, and for wildlife toxicity estimation using mammalian laboratory test data.

Specifications:
EPA is seeking CRADA partners interested in collaborating to further develop the Web-ICE toxicity estimation tool to expand its predictive capabilities to terrestrial plants, soil invertebrates, and for wildlife toxicity estimation using mammalian laboratory test data.  The CRADA is expected to involve multiple partners, including but not limited to non-governmental organizations, private sector companies, academic institutions, and companies with expertise in predictive toxicology.  Common areas of interest and potential collaboration include: 1) acquisition of toxicity data for terrestrial plants, soil invertebrates, and mammalian species, 2) development and validation of interspecies correlation models, and 3) incorporation of predictive models into the internet for access and use by users worldwide.  In addition to technical assistance and other in-kind collaboration, non-Federal partners can also provide direct funding to support specific project tasks.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions.  Any questions already submitted that are not answered here are being researched and will be answered in a future amendment.  The question deadline and proposal due date remain unchanged.

FMC-90121-07-0007-SOL2 - Questions and Answers (Amendment 3)


Can the government provide an estimate of total volume of the daily scanned documents?   
Approximately 10-15 documents per day.

What is the average page count per new document scanned?  
The page count for the documents scanned varies from one page to over 300 pages depending on the type of document being scanned.

What is the average number of images per new document scanned?  
There is no exact count of images because pictures are generally attachments to a text document.  The only other scanned images are the TFF images created when the documents are scanned into the system.

What kind of format are the documents (bound books, loose-leaf images, microfilm, etc.)?  
Most of the documents are single-sided paper documents 8 1/2" x 11" in size.  In some instances, pages to be scanned may be a different size, such as, legal pleadings (8 1/2" x 14"), postal return receipts, Federal Express receipts, etc.  In addition, some of the older documents may be bound volumes, carbon tissue, mimeographed images, or a copy of copied documents that may be of poor quality.
 
How many Laserfiche fields per document? What is in each index field?  
The number of Laserfiche fields depends on the type of document scanned.  Some documents only require the document class and the year of the, while others are more detailed.

Can we get a sample of an average document or one similar to these?  
For samples of many of the document types regularly scanned, visit www.fmc.gov, view Electronic Reading Room/Docketed Proceedings, select 1 of the 4 categories shown, such as, Formal Docket Decisions/Issuances, etc., and open the attachments.  

Can the government provide information on how many Laserfiche 7.2 systems (PCs/minis, scanners, storage devices) are available to the contractor to support the effort?  
There are currently two full scanning stations located in the Docket Activity Room of the Secretary's Office.  Each station consists of a computer with Laserfiche 7.2 software and a scanner.  The storage device and server are located and maintained in the Office of Information Technology.

What is the current throughput capacity of the current scanning systems?  
The main scanning station can scan approximately 62 pages per minute and the second scanning station can scan approximately 47 pages per minute.

Do you already have Laserfiche installed?  
Yes.  The software contractor installed Laserfiche under a separate contract, which includes software upgrades.  Our Office of Information Technology handles the daily maintenance of the software and computers.

Who is supplying the Laserfiche software?  
An outside contractor supplies and upgrades the Laserfiche software under a separate contract.

Does this require Laserfiche product certified staff?  
No.  The current scanning and indexing contractor received Laserfiche training along with the staff from the Office of the Secretary and the Office of Information Technology.  If needed, training can be provided to scanning and indexing contractor staff by the Lasherfiche software contractor.  However, working knowledge of the operation of Laserfiche software would be a plus.

FMC-90121-07-0007-SOL2 - Questions and Answers (Amendment 2)

1.  What is the value of the contract awarded to Document Systems, Inc. (DSI) for the previous/current effort?  The total obligation for that award is $24,000.
 

2.  As a point of clarification, the original synopsis/solicitation states:
The FMC's objective is to obtain on-site scanning and indexing services.     The contractor is responsible for providing 40 hours per week of on-site labor, 52 weeks per year, excluding the following federal holidays:
 
Amendment 001 states: 
As stated in the PWS, the FMC requires the contractor to provide one (1) person for 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, excluding federal holidays. 
 
Please clarify which statement is correct.  Given the magnitude of the re-indexing and quality requirements combined with the influx of new documents, it would appear that a single FTE would not even come close to satisfying the government from a productivity stand point.  Please see the following statement in the original solicitation under re-indexing that reads: This task is to be incorporated into the contractor?s daily duties and is to be accommodated, as time permits, after each day's scanning and indexing workload has been completed.

3.  Does the Service Contract Act apply to this procurement?  Yes.

4.  Please provide a copy of the QASP?  Reference PWS section 9.

5.  What information does the Government expect to be included in non-price factors?  Reference 52.212-1 and 52.212-2.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held?

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).
