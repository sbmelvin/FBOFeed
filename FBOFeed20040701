<DESC>The Government intends to purchase the following item sole source from TLD ACE (00365) the only known approved source.  TLD ACE is the only manufacturer of this dual voltage refrigerant compressor which will satisfy form, fit, and function of the TLD ACE end item ACE-410 Flight line Air Conditioner.  Item description: Noun: Refrigerator Compressor; NSN: 4120-01-153-0996RN; PN: 1004431; Period of Performance: Basic – One year, Option – 3 years; Basic Qty: 2 EA; Option Qty: 1-5; weight 999 pounds, 8 cylinder piston type R-134a refrigerant, 73.6 horsepower.  Functional Description: Refrigerant compressors are designed specifically for air conditioning, heat pumping, and refrigeration.  Small, stand-alone compressors are not included within this group.  Refrigerant compressors are large –scale units specifically designed to be the heart of an industrial cooling or air-conditioning system (HVAC).  They are integral components of the refrigerant cycle, in which refrigerant gases are cyclically evaporated and condensed, absorbing heat from the load to be cooled, and moved to an open environment where it is dissipated.  The compressor serves two main functions: to compress low pressure, low gases into high pressure and temperature gases, and to remove vapors from the evaporator to maintain a low boiling point.

The total estimated value of this acquisition is between $3,000,000 and $3,800,000.  The design and construction requires completion in approximately 365 days.

The Phase II Technical Factors include Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications of Key Personnel and Technical Solution.  The Government reserves the right to-reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government.

One contract will be awarded with a seed project, and the remaining with a minimum guarantee of $25,000 each.  The seed project is JOINT RESERVES POLICE STATION, NAS-JRB FORT WORTH, TX.  The estimated range for the seed project is between $2,150,000 and $2,650,000.  This procurement will include a potential award for one 8a eligible or one HUBZone eligible firm. These firms will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II. If an 8a or HUBZone firm is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the solicitation will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such. The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract. Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government. Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement. Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract. All professional disciplines shall be registered and-or certified in their discipline. In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach. Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects-new construction and renovation-including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities. Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II. An 8a or HUBZone firm, only 1, that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II. If more than one 8a or HUBZONE firm receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HUBZone firm with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II. This successful 8a or HUBZone contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders. If the successful 8a or HUBZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract. In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals. Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award. The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction. Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award. The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one seed project. All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable. If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms. Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal. Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation. The Government intends to issue the solicitation on the WEB only. Phase I will be issued on or about 11 February 2004 with Phase I Proposals will due on or about 15 March 2004. Phase II will be issued at a later date.

<DESC>This procurement is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition.  This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible proposers whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  The Government intends to award at least one contract to a qualified 8(a) firm.  Price evaluation preference will be given to HUBZone Small Business concerns, in accordance with FAR 52.219-4.  AWARD MAY BE MADE TO A FIRM OTHER THAN THAT SUBMITTING THE LOWEST PRICE.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL RECEIVED.  THEREFORE OFFERORS INITIAL PROPOSALS SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERMS.  This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor.  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction and repair by design-build or (to a lesser extent) design-bid-build of dry utilities at various locations within the AOR Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico.  However, it is anticipated the majority of the work will be performed in Southern California.  The work will be to build new, repair, or upgrade electrical distributions, lighting systems, cable television lines, and communication transmission lines, and all related work such as cable laying, pipe laying, tower, conduit and manhole construction.  The North American Industry Code Standard is 237130 and the annual size standard is $28.5 million.  In support of design-build strategies, each Offeror shall possess in-house capabilities or employ the services of a Lead Design Firm (A-E) experienced in the design development and coordination of projects within the scope of this contract.  Offerors may offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s).  The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team.  Lead Design Firm(s) (A-E), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project.  After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.  Should any of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded task orders.  The basic contract period will be for 12 months.  Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months or a value of $100 million, whichever occurs first.  The task order range for this contract is between $500,000 and $5,000,000.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $25,000 is guaranteed to be ordered to each awardee, under the basic performance period of the contract.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Selection for award will be based evaluation of the following:  Factor 1 - Past Performance of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 2 – Support of Small Business; Factor 3 - Experience of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 4 – Technical Approach; and Factor 5 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  The recommended subcontracting goals for the contract value (base and all options periods) are as follows:  8% - Woman-Owned Small Business; 10% - Small Disadvantaged Business; 3% - HUBZone Small Business; 3% - Veteran-Owned Small Business; 3% - Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; 1% - Utilization of Locally-Owned Small Business (for work in remote areas); - and 18% Other Small Business.  Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.  Proposed Task Order (PTO) 0001 is to provide all labor, materials and equipment necessary for the installation of airfield taxiway lights and an upgrade to the military base’s electrical distribution system.  The airfield lights installation covers the installation of elevated LED fixtures and the installation of a new conduit system for the semi-flush fixtures and all incidental related work.  The electrical distribution upgrade includes the construction an underground 7.2/12.47 kV electrical distribution system, the demolition of the old aerial distribution system, the installation of pad mount transformer and electrical duct banks and all incidental related work.  This PTO is representative of the projects that may be procured through this contract.  The estimated price range for Task Order 0001 is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to award a single contract for the performance of the Proposed Task Order identified in the RFP ("Proposed Task Order 0001") only.  The Government reserves the right not to award the Proposed Task Order 0001.  A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for 04 August 2003 at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

In support of design-build strategies, each Offeror shall possess in-house capabilities or employ the services of a Lead Design Firm (A-E) experienced in the design development and coordination of projects within the scope of this contract.  Offerors may offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s).  The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team.  Lead Design Firm(s) (A-E), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project.  After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.  Should any of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded task orders.  The basic contract period will be for 12 months.  Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months or a value of $100 million, whichever occurs first.  The task order range for this contract is between $500,000 and $5,000,000.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $25,000 is guaranteed to be ordered to each awardee, under the basic performance period of the contract.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Selection for award will be based evaluation of the following:  Factor 1 - Past Performance of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 2 – Support of Small Business; Factor 3 - Experience of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 4 – Technical Approach/Program Management/Bonding Capacity; and Factor 5 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  The recommended subcontracting goals for the contract value (base and all options periods) are as follows:  8% - Woman-Owned Small Business; 10% - Small Disadvantaged Business; 3% - HUBZone Small Business; 3% - Veteran-Owned Small Business; 3% - Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; 1% - Utilization of Locally-Owned Small Business (for work in remote areas); - and 18% Other Small Business.  Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.  Proposed Task Order (PTO) 0001 is to provide all labor, materials and equipment necessary for the construction of a waterline, pump station, landscape and irrigation system.  This PTO is representative of the projects that may be procured through this contract.  The estimated price range for Task Order 0001 is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to award a single contract for the performance of the Proposed Task Order identified in the RFP ("Proposed Task Order 0001") only.  The Government reserves the right not to award the Proposed Task Order 0001.  A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for 4 August 2004 at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Science and Technology Partnerships, (OSTP), plans to obtain a current and comprehensive database of commercially accessible drug discovery screening compounds including access to a sample procurement service and license, to be made available to NIH users with ChemNavigator, 6126 Nancy Ridge Drive, Suite 117, San Diego, California 92121.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541511 and the Business Size Standard is $21M.  This procurement is set aside for a Total one-hundred (100%) Small Business.  Period of performance; Firm Fixed Price contract:  License to institution-wide use of the 2-D chemical structure from the iResearch Library; Base Year - July 2004 - July 2005 with two (2) 12 month option years. In addition an Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity type contract will also be issued for compounds, chemistry, proteins, samples, silico screening, services, and procurement type services and fees. Researchers at NCI and NIH are increasingly screening small-molecule samples against specific molecular targets - mostly proteins - in an effort to find inhibitors (or sometimes activators), both as probes of the underlying biological mechanisms and as potential lead compounds in the fight against diseases such as cancer and AIDS.   The importance of this approach, and, concomitantly, the need for large collections of small molecules available to NIH researchers has been recognized by NIH’s leadership, which has found its expression in, e.g., the “Molecular Libraries” NIH RoadMap initiatives recently announced by NIH Director Dr. Elias Zerhouni.  Notwithstanding the great benefits that will hopefully stem from these initiatives, it is nevertheless clear that availability of actual screening samples for NIH researchers in the context of an NIH RoadMap Molecular Library Repository is (a) still a few years away, and (b) will be limited to a relatively small subset of 500,000 to 1 million different samples even when it becomes available.  In general, therefore, availability of screening samples from as wide a collection as possible and in a convenient manner for NIH researchers is currently not truly given.  The current universe of screening samples available from commercial sources world-wide is more than 10 million and growing. These samples come from over 200 different manufacturers, many of which are located in Eastern Europe.  It is technically and practically impossible for an individual researcher, or even an entire laboratory, to (a) obtain, standardize, combine, and search in the aggregate collection of, all these different supplier catalogs and databases, and (b), even if the former were possible, to place orders for, say, 100 samples coming from maybe twenty different suppliers located in the U.S., Canada, Russia, the Ukraine etc.  A company has been founded after recognition of this unmet need in the market, which is similarly felt by pharmaceutical industry.  ChemNavigator, Inc., aggregates the catalogs of screening samples from as many vendors world-wide as possible.  It standardizes and curates the individual suppliers’ databases, combines them into a large collection of unique structures, and makes this database (“iResearch Database”) of currently more than 10 million molecules available to its customers both through a web interface and in bulk format for in-house in silico screening. This service will be invaluable to NIH researchers, because it will make available the largest currently known collection of obtainable screening samples that was heretofore largely inaccessible for practical reasons.  Furthermore, this resource is available now and does not need any lengthy development and ramp-up time.  The ChemNavigator iResearch resource is unique in its ability to provide aggregate access to both structures and actual purchasable samples from the majority of available sources world-wide. It is the largest currently available collection of small-molecule screening samples.  The iResearch Database currently contains more than 11 million unique compounds, with a growing tendency.  ChemNavigator, Inc is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the iResearch Database and is the largest known database that can provide these unique compounds in one location.   This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, July 12, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number NCI- 40092-NG must be stated on all correspondence.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intend to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with BioVision Technologies Imaging Analysis System, 80 West Welsh Pool Road, North Exton, PA 19341, to purchase an upgrade to an existing government owned Imaging Analysis System.  The upgrade is required for use with an existing microscope system in the performance of client job request involving photomicroscopy subject matter.  Integration with the existing BioVision Imaging System hardware and software is essential.  The system must be able to utilize the full range of existing configured BioVision components on a Macintosh system platform with  IP Lab software and must be compatible with existing LUDL MAC5000 emission filters/shutters.  Therefore the upgrade of the Imaging Analysis System, will required a complete package that will enhance the performance and add new capabilities.  The existing government owned Imaging Analysis System was configured and manufactured by BioVision Technologies, and therefore only BioVision Technologies upgrade is compatible.  A change in the product would effect ongoing laboratory research and threaten the investment already made, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.  The North American  Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the Size  Standard is 500 employees  for this requirement.  There are no set aside restrictions for this acquisition.  This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part6.   The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses to this announcement, referencing  “Synopsis number” NHLBI-PS-2004-108, may submitted  to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042,  Bethesda, MD 20892-7902,  Attention: Deborah Coulter.

The NASA Langley Research Center instrument pod or the NASA Double Q-Bay pod may be used for this mission.  The payload will be integrated with the airplane at the contractor’s facility in Mojave, CA.	 A local flight will be conducted to verify correct operation of the instrument prior to deployment.   The airplane will transit to LaRC and use it as a base of operations for a series of science flights.	 The airplane will then be returned to California and the payload removed. NASA/DFRC intends to contract for these services directly from Scaled Composites, LLC, Mojave, CA under the terms and conditions of BPA No. E05479D.  The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  "Justification is based upon Scaled Composites, LLC's unique and proprietary capabilities to provide the required services involving both the Proteus Aircraft and the NASA Langley Research Center Instrument Pod and/or NASA DFRC Double Q-Bay Pod.  The Proteus is a one-of-a-kind aircraft that was designed and manufactured by Scaled Composites, LLC.	Additionally, the Proteus is the only existing aircraft that offers the payload, performance, and endurance capabilities necessary to meet the requirements of the High Altitude Airborne Science Program.  Award to any other source would result in failure to meet the Agency's requirements. The Government intends to acquire these commercial services using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 7, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE:  This announcement serves as a advance notice to all potential sources that on or about 22 July 2004, the Materiel Systems Group (MSG), Enterprise Combat Support System (ECSS) Program Office at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, anticipates the release of a SOURCES SOUGHT Synopsis (SSS) for system integration services.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. It is important to note that this advance notice is being issued for planning purposes only.  The ECSS Program Office does not currently have an approved acquisition strategy.  This advance notification does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quote (RFQ) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is prepared by respondents as a result of this advance notification. Background:  The ECSS Program Office is supporting the Air Force (AF) Directorate of Innovations and Transformations (HQ USAF/ILI) in researching the capabilities available through commercial Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Advance Planning and Scheduling (APS) products and integrators, learning about industry-leading ERP and APS vendors, and exploring how commercial ERP and APS solutions can accomplish AF logistics scenarios currently being handled by numerous legacy systems. The AF anticipates issuing the SSS on or about 22 July with vendor responses due 5 August 2004.  The anticipated SSS will be in support of market research being conducted by the AF to identify capable potential sources interested in providing ERP and APS integration services for the AF-wide ECSS program.  Note that this SSS is not for ERP or APS software products, but for integration services related to implementation of ERP or APS for AF-wide logistics.

The SNRA has experienced a mountain pine beetle infestation in lodgepole pine that has killed a large portion of trees in high value recreational sites. Tree transplants consist of mostly lodgepole pine, 10-15 feet in height; but where appropriate, occasional transplants of other native species may be used if the vegetation management plan deems their presence consistent with the natural occurrence within the habitat. The facilities are located on the Sawtooth National Recreation Area. Some sites are located on Highway 93, the Salmon River Road between Stanley and Challis, Idaho. The other sites are located at the Redfish Lake Recreation Complex off of Highway 75, 3 miles south of Stanley, Idaho. NAICS code: 115310; size standard: $6.0 Million. Estimated start date is 10/04/04 with 21 calendar days for completion. See numbered note #1.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Statistical Research and Applications Branch (SRAB), intends on entering into a sole source contract with the University of California at San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093; to continue support of the consortium of simulation modeling groups which began in September of 2000 the importnat task of building simulation models to study the impact of cancer control interventions on past and future population trends as well as optimal cancer control strategies.  The Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET)is a diverse group involving members from over a dozen different organizations at multiple sites around the world.  The CISNET consortium includes five grantees focusing on modeling for lung cancer.  An advantage of having a corsortium of modelers is the ability to employ a comparative modeling approach.  While each modeler has areas of individual focus, common "base" questions have been developed that allow for comparison across models.  The SRAB motivation is that sometimes widely different results from models are often difficult to resolve, and this project will provide a chance to reach common consensus on important questions, and to better understand the differences between models.  A set of common population inputs is used across all models (e.g., dissemination patterns of screening and treatment, mortality from non-cancer causes), and a common set of intermediate and final outputs is developed to help understand differences and similarities across models.  In reference to lung cancer the focus will be on modeling the impact of smoking on lung cancer mortality from 1975-2000.  While cigarette smoking is generally assumed to have had a substantial impact on lung cancer, there are certain aspects of modeling this impact which are still a major challenge, e.g., gaining a better understanding of the process of carcinogenesis for those who have quit smoking, undertanding the role of changing tobacco products on population trends, and understanding trends in lung cancer among non-smokers.  In order for these questions to be properly addressed, it is crucial to first obtain high-quality estimates of smoking initiation and cessation rates for the various gender and birth cohorts that comprise the US population over the period of interest.  The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a national-level survey, administered yearly, which has asked respondents about their cigarette smoking habits since 1965.  A previous analysis by Burns et al. demonstrated that multiple NHIS survey data sets, spanning the period 1968-1991, could be combined in order to produce gender-specific estimates of smoking initiation and cessation rates for "synthetic" 5-year birth cohorts.  Previous modeling efforts "Adjusting Cohort-specific Estimates of Initiation and Cessation of Cigarette Smoking for the Effect of Differential Mortality" were used to constuct input data sets for use by CISNET modelers, but was limited in that it applied only to white males and females, for wich the greatest amount of historical data is available.   Further limitations of previous analysis is that only initiation and cessation rates were produced, although it is well known that intensity (the number of cigarettes smoked) also have a strong effect on the relationship between smoking and lung cancer risk.  The NCI goal is to model initiation rates, cessation rates, and smoking intensity for three main segments of the US population: Whites, African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans, which will provide the CISNET modelers with information required to adequately model the effect of smoking on lung cancer incidence and mortality for the majority of the US population.  The University of California at San Diego is the only source known to the government that can provided the necessary personnel, expertise to perform the above required services/data.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the required services/information, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT on July 15, 2004, Attn: Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent.  This acquisitionis being processed based on FAR 13 the use of simplified acquisition procedures.  The NAICS Code is 541690 the business size standard is $6M.  Please refer to RFQ-NCI-40091-NQ when inquiring.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL  ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6,   AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS  NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL   NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-04-00329 and the solicitation  is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24. The  associated North Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334516 and the size  business size standard is 500 employees. Full and open competition procedures will be utilized. A  firm, fixed price purchase order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures is anticipated to result from the award of this  solicitation. This procurement is for a : Statement of Work: (1)The system must be able to produce luminance-modulated full-field Ganzfeld visual stimuli in the ultraviolet and visible wavelength spectrum in conjunction with steady state backgrounds in the ultraviolet and visible spectrum over a  large range of intensities to allow assessment of visual function in low light (scotopic) and daylight (photopic) conditions.  Intensities as low as - 6 log cd-s/m2 for recording of scotopic threshold response and as high as approximately 3.5 log cd-s/2 for recording bright flash response/leading  edge of A-wave should be achievable through software control of light source or filtering.  Flash or flickering stimuli and background fields should be specifiable in terms of chromaticity and luminance in photopic or scotopic units; (2) The system must be able to generate light stimuli in the near  ultraviolet wavelength range (350-400 nm) as well as in the visible wavelength range (400-700 nm).  To enable isolation of the different cone photoreceptor mechanisms in the rat, it will be necessary to have UV stimuli that can be either rapidly modulated, i.e. flash stimuli, or presented in  steady-state, as an adapting background; (3) Illumination intensity must be consistent with specified intensity from flash to flash: (4) A broad range of temporal modulations, from very rapid single flashes or trains of flashes of duration in the 5-10  s range to luminance modulation as slow as 0.5  Hz, is necessary to assess different visual functions.  This should also include the ability to generate and record data from two flashes in rapid succession (1-100 ms between flashes, aka "double flash"); (5)  The shape of the Ganzfeld device should be compatible with testing rats and/or mice by  either inserting the anesthetized animal into the Ganzfeld sphere or by allowing the positioning of the sphere such that it would present uniform illumination to the eye of the test animal.  In keeping with this requirement to be compatible with animal testing, any built-in ultraviolet filtering,  as with a xenon flash, should be removable for generation of UV stimuli; (6) The system should allow for the design and running of experiment protocols which will automatically set stimuli to desired specifications throughout an experiment to automate data collection: (7) Data sampling rate should  be at least 10KHz to allow high frequency sampling of electrophysiological signals without aliasing.  Amplifiers should allow for a wide range of frequency filters (high pass: DC, 0.1, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300 Hz; low pass: 5, 2, 1, 0.3, 0.1 kHz).  Amplifier gain should be adjustable to keep input  voltage within acceptable range: (8)  The system should permit recording electrophysiological waveforms from single stimulus events or averaged over multiple stimuli; (9) Data analysis capacity should include provisions to assign multiple markers to characterize waveform amplitudes and latencies,  to produce group average waveforms, and  to export for further analysis raw waveforms and/or waveform parameters (i.e., amplitude and latency of different peaks in waveform).  Capacity to perform Fourier analysis of recorded waveforms is desirable; (10) A GLP-compliant data recording capacity  should be counted as a desired, but not necessarily required feature.  A system which allowed for the choice of using or not using GLP-compliant procedures would be optimal and consistent with the mission of this lab in doing basic research and methods development as well as work related to  regulatory issues: (11) Delivered fob destination, RTP,NC. : The Government intends to award a single purchase order to responsible offeror  whose technically acceptable  quotation represents the best overall value to the Government .For this requirement best-value will be determine based on  technical capability, past performance and price.

The Government knows of only one source, Eighteen Nineteen Group, who is adequately familiar with and has the unique knowledge of the special IHS requirements identified by the CMS.  Specifically Eighteen Nineteen Group possesses the following unique qualifications necessary to provide the required services: (1) Knowledge of and familiarity with the Method E cost report variation/adjustments negotiated in the past six years with the CMS; (2) familiarity with staff responsible for the IHS administrative and clinical operations/information systems at over 47 hospitals, 10 Home Offices, 1 Tribal Consortium, and IHS Headquarters; (3) knowledge of IHS accounting and reimbursement systems/payment methods; (5) knowledge of IHS management reports required to determine cost and enable IHS to set rates; (6) knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of each level of the IHS and CMS and the protocol for collecting all necessary data; (7) knowledge of the unique and non-standardized IHS systems (IHS financial, property and equipment management, clinical and information systems); (8) knowledge of the unique management workload reports necessary to determine unit outpatient and inpatient costs to base rates; (9) knowledge of IHS variations in recording allowable and unallowable accounting data; and (10) knowledge of the IHS resource patient management system (RPMS).

Offeror=s certain they can meet the requirements are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research Program (SRP), plan to support the services of a Research Coordinator for the period of one year plus two one year options for the Native CIRCLE in continued collaborative efforts with the Mayo Clinic, Charlton 6, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN  55905.  Native C.I.R.C.L.E. (Cancer Information Resource Center and Learning Exchange) has been in operation as a national clearinghouse for cancer education materials specific to American Indian and Alaska Native communities for lay and professional use since September 1998.  This resource center has become part of NCI’s effort to disseminate the results of community-based research, including the culturally appropriate educational materials developed as part of the research endeavor. It is a collaborative effort with the Mayo Clinic and the NCI-supported Network for Cancer Control Research among American Indian and Alaska Native Cancer Populations, the oversight body for the Native CIRCLE, which has approval authority for materials included in the resource center to ensure that they are appropriate, relevant and evidence-based.  The reputation of Native CIRCLE extends nationally as a central resource for dissemination of research results and distribution of materials proven effective through research. Information requested from the resource center led to distribution in 2003 of over 35,000 pieces of literature and videos, with the center providing materials to over 30 conferences in the past year. The Research Coordinator shall maintain and disseminate quality cancer education and research materials to Native communities, which includes obtaining materials from researchers and educators, scheduling their review by the Native CIRCLE advisory board, cataloging approved materials and entering them into the database, answering requests from those seeking to use the materials, and keeping a record of those requests. The coordinator shall provide information on current and completed cancer research among native communities that will: 1) assist researchers as they develop and test methodologies for application of cancer control interventions, and 2) provide for community health educator materials that have proven successful in previous research. 
This service is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  The Mayo Clinic is the only organization known to the NCI that has aforementioned resources that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party has the connections and resources of the Native C.I.R.C.L.E. (Cancer Information Resource Center and Learning Exchange). An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on July 9, 2004.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC,Picatinny Arsenal,New Jersey, intends to issue a request for quotation (RFQ)on a sole-source basis for the modification of sixty six cable harnesses that were previously purchased under ARDEC Contract Number DAAE30-02-C-1012.  Modification of the cables are required to support critical fielding dates for the Mortar Fire Control System (MFCS). These cable harnesses are unique because they are the only cables of this type to become certified for MFCS. As a  previous supplier of the Cable Harness, Vermillion Inc is uniquely qualified to perform these modifications, entailing changes to internal elements of the cable harnesses, that are needed to insure that electrical compatibility is effectively maintained with the MFCS vehicle intercom alert. TACOM-ARDEC intends to award a sole source purchase order to Vermillion Incorporated, 4754 South Palisade, Wichita, KS 67217 for modification and upgrade of the MFCS Cable Harnesses.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  NOTE:  The agency does not anticipate any future requirements for this item.  Last time buy for the FMU-143 B/B Fuze.  Sources sought to determine the market interest to produce Fuze System, Bomb, FMU-143 B/B.  Please read for FMU-143B/ B description [BEGIN]: The FMU-143B/B Bomb Fuze is an electromechanical fuze system that provides impact delay detonation for penetrating warheads.  The fuze contains an explosive train, which is mechanically and electrically out-of-line until specific wea pon launch cycle events have occurred.  Once a valid launch has occurred, the fuze will arm in the selected arm time.  The B/B configuration has a selectable arm time of 5.5 and 12 seconds.  It has a fixed detonation delay after impact of 60 milliseconds.  The fuze is powered by an air-driven turbine generator power supply called the FZU-32 fuze initiator.  The initiator is non-explosive and has no specific safety requirements.  The FMU-143 fuze system is comprised of the following elements: (1)basic fuze with arming and safety pins attached (2)a fuze aft mounting retainer (3)a retractile cable assembly (4)a swivel and clip assembly (5)a FZU-32 initiator  Two each of these five elements are included in each shipping container.  The fuze is housed in an aluminum cylinder (with chem film finish), 8 in. long and 3 in. in diameter.  The fuze is equipped with a safety release assembly (housing and safety release  shaft), and a connector to accept operating power.  The fuze has a screwdriver adjustable selector feature to select arming delay times.  The fuze is threaded into the fuze well located at the aft end of the penetrator warhead.  The retractile cable elect rically connects the fuze, via an internal warhead conduit, to the FZU-32 initiator installed in the charging well approximately in the middle the warhead.   The initiator is secured by the aft fuze mounting retainer.  Prior to operational use the fuze may  be stored, transportated worldwide, installed in a weapon, loaded on an aircraft, and flown during captive carriage without release[END].  The estimated quantity is 8250 each.  The desired delivery schedule is to begin receiving product by September 2005.   Approximate 350 fuzes a month for the duration of the production is required.  Interested contractors should identify company size, descriptive information on your company's manufacturing capabilities (equipment, capacities, facilities, critical skills),  and past performance on electronic fuze or other similar items. Participation in the effort is strictly voluntary with no cost obligation incurred to the Government.  The Government at its discretion and without explanation may choose not to purchase all or part of the item describe herein.  All interested sources are requested to submit responses, but only in writing with clear and convincing documentation by July  22, 2004.  This synopsis is not a Request for Proposal.  This synopsis serves as a market r esearch tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal including the use of any appropriate small business programs.

This is in line with efforts by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) to provide economic rehabilitation and reform in Iraq to stimulate domestic and foreign investment, domestic and international trade, employment, and broad-based prosperity through private capital formation. 

In Iraq, there is strong demand for small business finance activities. Iraq has a relatively large domestic market and deep entrepreneurial roots.  Despite recently undergoing economic turmoil Iraq has the natural resources and infrastructure to support small businesses. A small business commercial lending program delivered by locally present financing institutions, using sound lending methodologies, has great potential to be successful.

The country faces large and urgent challenges in revitalizing the economy and creating new jobs.  Credit availability is a key factor in revitalizing the economy. The country’s capital stock has been seriously depleted and there has been little investment in plant and equipment for many years. 

Historically, small-and-medium size businesses have been successfully engaged in trading activities, agribusiness, light manufacturing, and a variety of other sectors. The primary objective of the activities under this grant program is to generate a productive and growing private sector, create rapid employment, and lay the foundation for sustainable growth and economic development.

Anticipated Results and Impact.  (1) The small business loans made possible by these grants will provide businesses, some of which have few other alternatives for obtaining needed capital, with financial resources for investment, expansion, working capital and other legitimate business purposes, thereby stimulating job creation and economic growth; (2) The grants will bolster financial institutions’ balance sheets. The experience gained by the applicants in making loans with grant funds will increase the technical and managerial competence of the applicants. The grant funds also will provide applicants with opportunities to increase their customer base by seeking out new borrowers to whom to lend; (3) The program has been designed for maximum flexibility and simplicity in order to facilitate a credit flow to small businesses as quickly as feasible in view of the current stressful economic and political situation in Iraq, including high unemployment, large excess manufacturing capacity and severe shortage of medium term credit through the financial system.

General Program Description and Focus.  Objective: (1) Enable funds to be distributed into the economy quickly via small business loans, thus stimulating commercial activity and creating employment in the private sector; (2) Provide impetus and capability to financial institutions to establish medium term lending programs (two years to five years) based on sound financial practices and cash flow analysis.

Grantee criteria.  (1) Private sector financial institutions in Iraq in good standing that engage in lending, including private sector banks and NGOs engaged in microfinance, will be eligible to receive Grants; (2) Grants in the aggregate to an individual Grantee may not comprise more than 50% (giving effect to the grants) of the total loan portfolio of the Grantee.

Loan Characteristics:  (1)  Funding: Each loan made with grant funds (“Small Business Loan”) must be comprised 50% of grant funds and 50% of funds from the Grantee’s own resources;  (2) Size:  Each Small Business Loan must be between $25,000 and $500,000. Each Grant with respect to a Small Business Loan will therefore be in the range of $12,500 to $250,000; (3) Term:  Small Business Loans will have a final maturity within the range of two to five years. Level amortization payments shall begin no earlier than the 12-month anniversary of the loan; (4) Small Business Loans must carry an interest rate that conforms to Iraq financial market standards current at the time of the making of the loan; (5) Borrowers under this program must be majority owned by Iraqis and operated by Iraqis. No state-owned enterprises, but joint ventures are eligible so long as majority owned and operated by Iraqi private sector; (6) Borrowers must utilize the funds for legitimate business purposes; (7) Note that borrowers do not need to be “small businesses”. Grantees may apply their own credit risk standards in making decisions whether or not to extend Small Business Loans; (8) As part of its due diligence and credit analysis process, each Grantee must produce a business plan for each Small Business Loan it intends to make including the following information on the borrower: (a) use of proceeds; (b) business description; (c) competitive analysis; (c) historical financial statements; (d) projected future financial statements (giving effect to the loan); (e) projected cash flow debt service coverage ratios; (f) description of management; (g) description of shareholders


Excluded Transactions: (a) Activities related to tobacco; (b) Activities related to the production of alcoholic beverages; (c) Drug products not certified by applicable health authorities; (d) Activities related to gambling; (e) Activities related to military


Administrator Responsibilities.  (1) The Administrator and the Grantor shall establish a segregated bank account in a reputable bank for the grant funds (the “Grant Pool”). The Grantor will have signature authority over the account which it will delegate to the Administrator in whole or in part at its discretion. The Grantor at its discretion may transfer all or a portion of available funds at any time into the Grant Pool for onward distribution to Grantees. The Administrator may only transfer funds from the Grant Pool in order to fund Small Business Loans and for no other purpose. The Administrator shall not transfer funds from the Grant Pool to pay any expense or fee or procurement on behalf of the Administrator or any third party. (2) The Administrator shall receive applications for Grants from potential Grantees.  Prior to forwarding application to Administrator, Grantee will review application and perform credit investigation on borrower.  If Grantee approves loan, then Grantee may forward to Administrator for apply for matching funds.  Each such application will include documentary evidence to demonstrate conformance with all items under “Grantee Criteria”, “Loan Characteristics” and “Excluded Transactions” but the Administrator shall not impose onerous or unreasonably burdensome requirements on the Grantee relative to compiling the application. The Administrator will use reasonable judgment in viewing the evidence but will not be required to confirm the accuracy or completeness of the evidence and will not be liable for any mistakes or omissions in the evidence. (3) Upon successful review of an application, the Administrator shall instruct the Grantee to disburse the amount of the Grantee’s own matching funds (50% of the amount of the proposed Small Business Loan) to the borrower. Upon evidence of such disbursement on a timely basis, the Administrator shall transfer the grant portion of the Small Business Loan from the Grant Pool directly into the account of the borrower. Payment of principal and interest on the entire Small Business Loan will be due to the Grantee, and the Administrator shall have no responsibility for ensuring the borrower’s performance under the loan agreement with the Grantee. (4) The Administrator shall require periodic reports from the Grantee on the performance of the Small Business Loans made with grant funds. The Administrator shall be empowered (subject to Grantor’s discretion) to preclude from further participation in the program any Grantee whose Small Business Loan portfolio performance is materially worse than the aggregate Small Business Loan portfolio, excluding the Grantee in consideration. (5) The Administrator shall not give preference in allocating Grants to particular Grantees. Applications for Grants shall be processed in the order received. Any Grantee may not submit more than two applications per week in order to allow all Grantees access to the Grant Pool. (6) The Administrator shall consult periodically with the Grantor on the progress and performance of the program; shall prepare and provide  Quarterly Utilization Reports to the Grantor no later than 15 calendar days after the close of a quarter; and shall provide other information whether in the form of reports or otherwise as requested by the Grantor to fulfill Grantor’s statutory and management responsibilities and objectives. (7) The Grantor in its sole discretion shall have the power to exclude any actual or potential Grantee from the program or limit participation in the program. If the Administrator believes that any actual or potential Grantee should be excluded or limited on the basis of financial, legal, moral or other valid reason, it shall promptly consult with the Grantor and carry out the instructions of the Grantor. (8) The Administrator shall not accept applications for grants from any Grantee under common control or ownership with the Administrator.

Start-Up, Implementation, Duration and Termination.  (1) The Administrator should be prepared to begin administration of the program within one week of signing the contract. The Administrator shall promote at its own expense the existence of the program with potential grantees in all areas of the country with the intent of achieving a reasonable geographic dispersion of grant funds.(2) The program will terminate at the end of one year. Any grant funds not expended by that time will be donated to a charitable organization for activities in Iraq, by decision of the Grantor after consultation with the Administrator. (3) The Grantor may terminate the Administrator at any time, with or without cause. If so terminated, the Administrator will be eligible to receive fees, in accordance with the contract, proportionate to its level of activity prior to termination date.

 Reporting Requirements.  (1) Quarterly Utilization Reports of the amount of grant funds used in the preceding period are required of the Administrator per information noted above. (2) Grant recipients may be subject to an audit during the 12 months that this facility is available.  This audit would be limited to review of the loans made under this program and their general administration and would be paid for by the Grantor using funds from the Grant Pool or otherwise at the Grantor’s discretion.
  
Oversight.  The Administrator will be accountable to Grantor for achieving tasks set forth in the contract. All tasks under the contract are to be carried out subject to the supervision, direction, and any necessary redirection by the Grantor.

Duration of the contract period: one year from Grant Award

<DESC>The US Army RDEC Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with B.A. Tech, U. S. Ltd., of Fall River, MA, under the authority of 15 USC 657f and FAR 19.1406(a) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Bu siness Sole Source Award, a quantity of 200 each, for design validation and test quantity manufacture of a Low Velocity (LV) Cargo Parachute.  Product Manager-Force Sustainment Systems (PM-FSS) will manage this effort as part of the Low Cost Aerial Deliver y System (LCADS) program.  The parachute will meet the same performance parameters as the existing Low Velocity G-12 parachute while reducing cost by 55-80%.  They are made of woven polypropylene sewn in a cross-hatch design with the parachute legs knotted  directly to nylon suspension lines, and are designed for one-time use applications.   The LV chutes are currently in the design validation phase, and a series of changes will be made to the chute design based upon results from airdrop testing.  Small numb ers (2 to 4) of the prototype parachutes are being tested at one time; the test results are then used to make appropriate changes to the parachute and new prototypes are built for the next series of tests.  Before the final parachute design is decided upon , the manufacturer will be expected to work without an updated drawing package and be able to incorporate changes to the parachute within very short turn around time, as necessitated by the compressed test schedule.  The small number of chutes being made a t one time to any single design requires great flexibility and responsiveness on the part of the fabricator.  In addition, the manufacturer must have experience in fabricating airdrop items.  Once the design is finalized, the parachute will enter Developme ntal Testing and then Operational Testing.  The manufacturer is to provide the LV parachutes required throughout these test efforts, an estimated 200 chutes.  Natick will provide a preliminary drawing package.  The manufacturer will be responsible for obta ining all required material (fabric, thread, etc) and for complete fabrication of the chute, including packing.  The manufacturer will also provide feedback to Natick as to the manufacturability of the parachute, suggest changes to the drawings and design,  and help implement the changes.   NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.  All questions and/or inquiries must be submitted either by datafax or E-mail, NO TELEPHONE CALLS PLEASE.

<SUBJECT>Y -- 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement Program for Construction Projects for Hawaii-based 8(a) Firms.
<SOLNBR>8(a)-02-R-BOA
<RESPDATE>102302
<CONTACT>June Turner, Contracting Officer, Phone (808) 474-5401, Fax (808) 474-3387, Email turnerje@1pwcpearl.navy.mil
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: RESTRICTED TO HAWAII AND GUAM 8(a) FIRMS SERVICED BY THE HAWAII SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION DISTRICT OFFICE AND OTHER 8(a) PARTICIPANTS WITH BONA-FIDE PLACES OF BUSINESS IN HAWAII AND GUAM. (No solicitation will be available. This is an announcement that is open indefinitely.) The Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC), Pearl Harbor is seeking interest from Hawaii and Guam 8(a) program participants serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii and Guam to participate in a Blanket Ordering Agreement (BOA) Program. (If you are currently a Hawaii or Guam-Based BOA Holder, no further action is required on your part.) BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific Division, Resident Officer in Charge of Construction, Pearl Harbor, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. Annually, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only. If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the Hawaii and Guam BOA holders serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii and Guam. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement but there is a threshold of not less than $25,000 that can be placed on a Task Order with a maximum of $3,000,000. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only. The anticipated construction work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. The anticipated construction work to be covered under the BOAs include, but is not limited to, new construction, minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, alterations, repairs (emergency and routine)), handling of hazardous waste and material, maintenance, mechanical, electrical, heating/air conditioning, painting, paving, earthwork, demolition, installing pipelines, and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items). The NAICS Sectors covered under the BOA are for work performed in the NAICS Sectors 233, 234, and 235 for construction. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military and government installations on the Islands of Hawaii, the Territory of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. freely-associated island-nations of the Republic of Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia. The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years with the Government's right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c). The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. If a firm is exiting from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will be terminated. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. SOLICITATIONS: The contractor may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. LIMITATION OF ORDERS: The range will be from $25,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000. SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: (1) Provide 8(a) Certification. (2) Registered in the Department of Defense (DOD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. (3) Licensed/Bonded and fully capable to perform construction work under the NAICS Code Series 233, 234, and 235. (4) Provide resumes indicating the qualifications of key personnel of the Design-Build Team, if applicable, to include principals (design and construction), project manager (design and construction), registered professionals for each design discipline (architect, civil engineer, structural engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, and fire protection engineer), and sustainable design consultant, if being considered for design and/or design-build projects. Provide a narrative that describes the Design-Build Team?s internal communication system used to ensure a successful project, if being considered for design and/or design-build projects. (5) Provide up to three references of completed projects within the last three years for EACH NAICS sector that reflect your firm?s performance and qualifications similar in size and general scope and the possible complexity to which the firm would like to be considered. A request for a BOA may be denied if a contractor has an Experience Modifier Rate (EMR) greater than 1.2 and/or an incidence rate higher than 5.0. To register in the DOD CCR database, go to the CCR website at http://www.ccr2000.com/, go to "Start New Registration", and follow the directions for registration. All requirements under the BOA Program will be offered via E-mail or posted on NAVFAC's Electronic Solicitation (E-Sol) website at http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil for downloading. This will normally be the only method of distributing solicitation documents. All BOA holders are encouraged to visit the E-Sol website frequently for the solicitation documents issued under the BOA Program. All BOA holders shall create an account for each solicitation in which they wish to participate at the website http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil to ensure that they are notified of updates or amendments to the solicitation as they occur. No other notice of solicitation activity will be provided to interested offerors. BOAs will be processed in the order in which a complete evaluation package is received. BOAs will be used for competitive purposes. Unless you respond to this synopsis or subsequent synopses, which will be issued periodically, you will not be able to participate in this BOA program.

<DESC>CORRECTION TO CLOSING DATE-THE PHASE I PROPOSAL DUE DATE HAS BEEN CHANGED TO 03 MAR 2004 vs 15 MAR 2004. 
THIS SOLICITATION IS ISSUED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS, INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  The project involves all labor, material, transportation, equipment and supervision for the design and construction of a Passenger Terminal.  These facilities shall contain shops, ground electronics, air cargo storage, arresting gear, passenger terminal, and administrative spaces.  The approximate size of the Passenger Terminal is 1,226 square meters.  Type of construction is masonry, single story building with standing seam metal roof on pier foundation.  The total estimated value of this acquisition is between $3,000,000 and $3,800,000.  The design and construction requires completion in approximately 365 days.  Proposals will be evaluated using two—phase source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to a maximum of five offerors, design-build firms or teams, based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications, and Management Approach.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project.  The price proposal will be a lump sum price for the project, and may include the evaluation of scope-design options within the Governments published budget for award. The Phase II Technical Factors include Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications of Key Personnel and Technical Solution.  The Government reserves the right to-reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVUALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms. Proposers should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. FIRMS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR SPECIFICATIONS OR DOCUMENTATION. The Government intends to issue the Phase I Request for Proposals, RFP, electronically by posting it on the NAVFAC website, http://esol.navfac.navy.mil on or about 11 February 2004.   Offerors must register on the Internet at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Phase I proposals will be due on or about 15 March 2004.  In Phase II, RFP will be posted on the NAVFAC web site for viewing and downloading, although the download time may be excessive. Copies of a compact disk, CD ROM, of the Phase II plans and specifications may be purchased from the Defense Automated Printing Service, DAPS, in Charleston, SC. The Point of Contact at DAPS is Paula Brooks at 843-743-2500, ext. 24. The FAX Number for DAPS is 843-743-2505.  The official plan holders list will be maintained on and may be printed from the web site.  Amendments will be posted on the web site for downloading.

<DESC>CORRECTION TO PHASE I CLOSING DATE-THE PHASE I PROPOSAL DUE DATE HAS BEEN CHANGED TO 03 MARCH 2004 vs 15 MARCH 2004. 
THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED AS ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FOUR SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY, IDIQ, DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8A OR HUBZONE FIRM AND THE OTHER THREE ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED. The Solicitation Number is N62467-04-R-0095. The NAICS Code for this Solicitation is 236220-Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The Size Standard is $28,500,000. Work covers general building type projects, new construction and renovations, including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for the Resident Officer in Charge of Construction Fort Worth, TX, area of responsibility. The work will be at the following primary locations-Naval Air Station-Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, TX, outlying reserve stations throughout eastern and central Texas.   Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal, RFP, procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered. It is the intent of the Government to award up to four contracts.  Each contract is for one year with four option years. The anticipated workload is $1-$10 million over the life of the four contracts, and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $30 million. Projects will vary in size from around $50,000 to $3 million with the average project in the $500,000 - $1.5 million range. One contract will be awarded with a seed project, and the remaining with a minimum guarantee of $25,000 each.  The seed project is JOINT RESERVES POLICE STATION, NAS-JRB FORT WORTH, TX.  The estimated range for the seed project is between $2,150,000 and $2,650,000.  This procurement will include a potential award for one 8a eligible or one HUBZone eligible firm. These firms will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II. If an 8a or HUBZone firm is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the solicitation will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such. The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract. Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government. Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement. Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract. All professional disciplines shall be registered and-or certified in their discipline. In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach. Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects-new construction and renovation-including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities. Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II. An 8a or HUBZone firm, only 1, that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II. If more than one 8a or HUBZONE firm receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HUBZone firm with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II. This successful 8a or HUBZone contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders. If the successful 8a or HUBZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract. In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals. Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award. The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction. Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award. The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one seed project. All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable. If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms. Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal. Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation. The Government intends to issue the solicitation on the WEB only. Phase I will be issued on or about 11 February 2004 with Phase I Proposals will due on or about 15 March 2004. Phase II will be issued at a later date. The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil. Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the web site.  Copies of a compact disk, CD ROM,  of the Phase II plans and specifications may be purchased from the Defense Automated Printing Service, DAPS, in Charleston, SC. The Point of Contact at DAPS is Paula Brooks at 843-743-2500, ext. 24. The FAX Number for DAPS is 843-743-2505. The official planholders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to clarify Sources Sought synopsis PR-HQ-04-11916, originally posted to Fed Bizz Ops on June 23, 2004.  This Sources Sought synopsis is being conducted to identify businesses that possess the necessary technical capabilities to provide Multi-Level, Multi-Matrix Organic Sample Analysis for USEPA's Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI).  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS IS BEING CONDUCTED IN RELATION TO OUR PREVIOUSLY POSTED PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS PR-HQ-04-11340 (posted May 7, 2004) FOR THE SAME SERVICES, AND DOES NOT REPLACE PR-HQ-04-11340. Issues raised by several interested parties suggest that the original submission deadline of July 9, 2004 for laboratory Quality Assurance Plans (QAP's) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) does not provide enough time for complete preparation of the documents, given the complex nature of the requirements of Exhibit E of the SOM1.X Statement of Work (SOW).  AS A RESULT, WE HAVE DECIDED TO EXTEND THE SUBMISSION DEADLINE BY TWO WEEKS TO JULY 23, 2004. Furthermore, the request for submission of written QAP's and SOP's that meet the requirements of Exhibit E of the SOW is clarified as follows:  QAP's submitted in response to this Sources Sought synopsis ARE NOT REQUIRED to address each specific technical of scientific detail of the SOM1.X SOW analysis procedures.  However, QAP submissions must include all of the ELEMENTS of QAP's as described in Exhibit E, Sections 5.1 through 5.1.2 and Section 5.2, Parts A through G, and be able to detail the general practices of the laboratory that serve to meet the INTENT of each specific requirement of  Exhibit E, Sections 5.1 through 5.1.2 of the SOW.   SOP's submitted in response to this Sources Sought synopsis ARE NOT REQUIRED to address each specific technical or scientific detail of the SOM1.X SOW analysis procedures.  However, SOP submissions must include all of the ELEMENTS concerning SOP's as described in Exhibits E and F of the SOW, and be able to detail the general practices of the laboratory that serve to meet the INTENT of Exhibit E, Sections 6.0 through 6.3 12, and Exhibit F, Sections 3.0 through 3.8.2 of the SOW.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to negotiate with NPD Intelect, LLC on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) only one responsible source.
 
The acquisition includes the purchase of a dataset that will allow the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to construct deflators for the value of PCE for IT goods under more general conditions than those underlying the deflators BEA currently uses.  The ideal dataset would contain transaction prices and quantities for goods purchased by consumers in the U.S.  The data must be high-frequency data (i.e., monthly rather than annually) so that BEA can introduce new goods into the price indexes in a timely manner and “goods” must be defined at a sufficiently granular level so that BEA can control for quality differences across goods.

NPD Intelect, LLC is uniquely qualified to provide the dataset and components by providing point-of-sale pricing and quantity data for eleven (11) broad classes of information technology equipment (listed below) that was purchased by consumers at U.S. retail outlet stores during the duration of any given month.  In addition to providing the ideal coverage (U.S. consumers), the data is reported at high frequencies (monthly).

34 IT Categories:
Desktop PCs, Notebook PCs, Printers, MultiFunction Printers, Fax Machines, Label Printers, PC Monitors, PC Projectors, Hard Drives, Floppy Drives, Tape Drives, CD Drives, DVD Drives, CD Media, DVD Media, Data Cartridges, Floppy Disks, Inkjet Cartridges, Toner Cartridges, Technology Paper, Calculators, Personal Organizers, Reference Databanks, PDAs, Networking Products, Mice, Other Pointing Devices, Keyboards, Entertainment Devices, Multimedia Speakers, Scanners, Memory Cards, PC Batteries, Sound Cards

Offeror's certain they can meet the requirements are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to Contracting Officer.  Note 22 is applicable to this announcement.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15-days after publication of this synopsis.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking proposals from contractors interested in entering into a Firm-Fixed Price (with Economic Price Adjustment) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract (s) to support the world wide demand for Primary Total Hip Implants, Hemi-Arthoplasty Hip Implants, Primary Total Knee Implants and all components and instrumentation sets necessary for implantation.   Contractors will be required to submit a catalog, detailing their entire product line that falls within these product line groups.  All products must be Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved.  We intend to award contracts to contractors who submit offerors that comply with the requirements of the solicitation.

This procurement applies to Government facilities worldwide.  Initially, contractor’s will be asked to supply a Continental United States (CONUS) catalog, which includes all facilities located in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia as well as Alaska and Hawaii.   The Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) catalog will include facilities located outside the continental United States and will be required in the future under this solicitation.  Each contractor’s product line will be loaded into the DSCP Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of an item inclusive of transportation and distribution costs. Physicians from the ordering facility will make a “Best Value” decision when selecting products.  

Implants, components and instruments will be delivered to the Medical Treatment Facilities using three delivery methods;  “Just-in-Time”, “Direct Delivery” or “Consignment Agreement” .  All contractor’s must be able to provide all three delivery methods.  This procurement contains an on-site personnel requirement for the contractor to provide technical advice and guidance to physicians before, during and after implantation at the request of the Medical Treatment Facility.  

All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Confirmation and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic.  Each vendor will be required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgement’s, send 855-Order Confirmation’s, and transmit 810-Invoice’s for payment.  There are (3) three communication options available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface, American National Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI Standards and the Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX).  Vendors must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options.  Vendors will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.

The subject solicitation is a standing solicitation that will remain in effect unless replaced by an updated solicitation.  Closing dates and time for receipt of proposals are hereby established as 3:00 P.M./EST on the last business day of every month.  Vendors can submit proposals any time prior to the closing date.  However, evaluation of all proposals received by the closing date will not be evaluated until the solicitation has closed.  Any resultant contract will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods.  This procurement has an estimated dollar value of $20 million dollars over the total contract period for all contracts combined.

<SOLNBR>W911W6-04-R-0005
<RESPDATE>082604
<ARCHDATE>10252004
<CONTACT>Paulette Wilson, (757) 878-2788
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology (AATD), U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center, Fort Eustis, Virginia, has a competitive requirement for the design, development, analysis, documentation, and fabrication of two (2)  structural test articles and one (1) prototype shipset of the Lightweight Armament Support Structure (LASS) .  The requirement includes optional production LASS shipsets with minimum quantity of 22 and maximum quantity of 32.  The LASS will replace the Ex ternal Fuel System (EFS) stub wings on the MH-60L Integrated Defensive Armed Penetrator (IDAP).  The goal of the program is to reduce weight on the fleet of MH-60L IDAP helicopters.  Currently, the EFS stub wings provide the most likely source of significa nt weight reduction on the aircraft.  The EFS are shortened, single-store-station versions of the External Stores Support Systems (ESSS), which were originally designed to support over 3200 pounds on the inboard stores station and almost 1700 pounds on the  outboard stores station at the same time. Due to changes in mission and equipment over time, the EFS now does not support fuel at all and the heaviest load is expected to be less than 700 pounds.  It is expected that a redesign of the EFS will result in a  weight savings of 60-70% of the main support structure, equating to a savings of approximately 200 pounds per shipset. The specification document for this acquisition may be viewed at the following website:   http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Transfer/LASS_ Specification.doc.  The successful offeror will be required to generate technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, USC., SEC 2751 ET SEQ).  The procurement is 100% setaside for small business concerns.  Award will b e a single firm-fixed-price contract with option (s).  The non-recurring development/engineering base effort period of performance is 10 months.  The anticipated optional production delivery schedule is up to 24 months after option exercise (based on 32 sh ipsets) with accelerated delivery desired.  The anticipated award date is 4 November 2004.  A solicitation will be issued on 15 July 2004 and the closing date will be on 26 August 2004.  The applicable North American Industrial classification System (NIACS ) code is 336413 and the size standard is 1,000.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Notes:  1 and 26 apply.

<DESC>The Primary Point of Contact for this project is Valerie J. Sands, Contract Specialist, (817) 886-1050.  Presolicitation Notice   Unrestricted Solicitation (with up to five (5) Unrestricted, a minimum of two (2) HUBZone set-asides, and a minimum of t wo (2) 8(a) set-asides for  Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Southwestern Division) for Design-Build Construction, Construction, Anti-Terrorism/Force Protectio n (AT/FP), Services, and Remediation of real property, to include (but not limited to) planning, designing and constructing new and/or renovated facilities located within the boundaries of military and civilian customers.  This MATOC will include Time-and- Materials provisions.  Typical projects include a wide variety of maintenance, repair, replacement, renovation, minor construction (including asbestos and lead base paint abatement), restoration or modernization of a wide variety of facilities, and tasks i nclude (but are not limited to) planning, design and installation/construction of the following systems:  HVAC, plumbing, electrical, elevators, building envelope, fire protection, AT/FP, or total renovation.  North American Industrial Classification Syste m (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $28.5 Million.  It is the intent of the Fort Worth District to issue one (1) solic itation for award of five (5) Unrestricted, and a minimum of two (2) HUBZone), and a minimum of two (2) 8(a), creating three separate multiple award contractor pools.  The total contract capacity is estimated not to exceed $200 Million over a five-year con tract period ($160 Million for Unrestricted, $20 Million for HUBZone, and $20 Million for 8(a)).  To preclude the need to re-solicit, there must be at least two awards to create an 8(a) pool and at least two awards to create a Hubzone pool.  If there are n ot enough 8(a) awards to establish an 8(a) pool, or if there are not enough Hubzone awards to establish a Hubzone pool, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by one of two methods:  1) equally distribute the capaci ty to the remaining set-aside pool unless no set-aside pool can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the Unrestricted contractor pool, or 2) make an additional competitive award to the remaini ng set-aside pool unless no set-aside pool can be established due to lack of competition at which point a sixth unrestricted contractor will be awarded.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months wi th up to four (4) Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of sixty (60) months.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until c ontract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with docume nted unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance.  For estimating purposes only, each of the five (5) Unrestricted Contractors estimated maximum per one-year contract period is $32  Million, and each of the HUBZone Competitive and 8(a) competitive Contractors estimated maximum per one-year contract period is $10 Million.  However, each Unrestricted Contractor has the opportunity to receive award amounts up to the estimated Unrestrict ed total contract capacity of $160 Million.  Likewise, each HUBZone competitive contractor and 8(a) competitive contractor has the opportunity to receive awards  up to the estimated HUBZone and 8(a) total contract capacity of $20 Million, respectively.  The minimum guarantee for each Unrestricted contract will be $10,000.  The minimum guarantee for each HUBZone and 8(a) contract will be $5,000.  The minimum guaran tee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.   The minimum task order limitation for the Unrestricted, HUBZone Competitive and 8(a) Competitive contracts will be $2,500.  The maximum task order limitation for the contracts will be  $32 Million (Unrestricted), $10 Million (HubZone) and $10 Million (8a).  After award of the basic contracts, Unrestricted contractors will not compete with the HUBZone or 8(a) contrac tors for award of individual task orders.  In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement, consideration may be given to 1) the complexity of the work; 2) past performance of the contractor; 3) contract task order limita tion; 4) on-going work, 5) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum order limitation.  Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about July 19, 2004, under solicitatio n number W9126G-04-R-0013, after the Acquisition Plan has been approved.  Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about August 17, 2004 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  If the Government elects to conduct a Pre-Proposal Conference, details r egarding the Conference will be provided in the solicitation. The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon the overall Best Value to the Government.  Procurement consider ation will be given to technical capability (including specialized experience, past performance, organization and management, key personnel, safety record, quality control, and schedule capability), price and other salient factors included in the solicitat ion.  Proposals from Large businesses must comply with FAR Clause 52.219-9, regarding the requirement for a Subcontracting Plan.  The Fort Worth District goals (expressed as a percentage of the contractors total planned subcontract amount) are as follows:  Small Business 57.2%; Small Disadvantaged Business 10%; Women-Owned Small Business 10%; HUBZone Small Business 3%, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business 3%.

<SOLNBR>W914NS-04-R-0157
<RESPDATE>071604
<ARCHDATE>07312004
<CONTACT>LTC Karen Maskew
<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION ---      

POC for this solicitation is LTC Karen Maskew, karen.maskew@cpa-iq.org.  Please submit any questions in writing only.  

Full text of this soliciation is available at the following website:  http://iraqcoalition.org/business.  Alternate location: www.cpa-iq.org.  Click on Business Opportunities, then CPA Solicitations, then search by Solicitation Number for W914NS-04-R-0157.

Description:  The purpose of the grant program that will be operated by the Administrator is to provide grants to Iraqi financing institutions (“Grantees”), which Grantees will leverage on a one-to-one basis for small business lending to businesses owned and operated by Iraqis.  It is expected to lead to a sustainable commercial lending profile in the Iraqi finance industry with the intention of providing a successful example that would be duplicated in all financial institutions in the country.  This is in line with efforts by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) to provide economic rehabilitation and reform in Iraq to stimulate domestic and foreign investment, domestic and international trade, employment, and broad-based prosperity through private capital formation. 

In Iraq, there is strong demand for small business finance activities. Iraq has a relatively large domestic market and deep entrepreneurial roots.  Despite recently undergoing economic turmoil Iraq has the natural resources and infrastructure to support small businesses. A small business commercial lending program delivered by locally present financing institutions, using sound lending methodologies, has great potential to be successful.

The country faces large and urgent challenges in revitalizing the economy and creating new jobs.  Credit availability is a key factor in revitalizing the economy. The country’s capital stock has been seriously depleted and there has been little investment in plant and equipment for many years. 

Historically, small-and-medium size businesses have been successfully engaged in trading activities, agribusiness, light manufacturing, and a variety of other sectors. The primary objective of the activities under this grant program is to generate a productive and growing private sector, create rapid employment, and lay the foundation for sustainable growth and economic development.

Anticipated Results and Impact.  (1) The small business loans made possible by these grants will provide businesses, some of which have few other alternatives for obtaining needed capital, with financial resources for investment, expansion, working capital and other legitimate business purposes, thereby stimulating job creation and economic growth; (2) The grants will bolster financial institutions’ balance sheets. The experience gained by the applicants in making loans with grant funds will increase the technical and managerial competence of the applicants. The grant funds also will provide applicants with opportunities to increase their customer base by seeking out new borrowers to whom to lend; (3) The program has been designed for maximum flexibility and simplicity in order to facilitate a credit flow to small businesses as quickly as feasible in view of the current stressful economic and political situation in Iraq, including high unemployment, large excess manufacturing capacity and severe shortage of medium term credit through the financial system.

General Program Description and Focus.  Objective: (1) Enable funds to be distributed into the economy quickly via small business loans, thus stimulating commercial activity and creating employment in the private sector; (2) Provide impetus and capability to financial institutions to establish medium term lending programs (two years to five years) based on sound financial practices and cash flow analysis.

Grantee criteria.  (1) Private sector financial institutions in Iraq in good standing that engage in lending, including private sector banks and NGOs engaged in microfinance, will be eligible to receive Grants; (2) Grants in the aggregate to an individual Grantee may not comprise more than 50% (giving effect to the grants) of the total loan portfolio of the Grantee.

Loan Characteristics:  (1)  Funding: Each loan made with grant funds (“Small Business Loan”) must be comprised 50% of grant funds and 50% of funds from the Grantee’s own resources;  (2) Size:  Each Small Business Loan must be between $25,000 and $500,000. Each Grant with respect to a Small Business Loan will therefore be in the range of $12,500 to $250,000; (3) Term:  Small Business Loans will have a final maturity within the range of two to five years. Level amortization payments shall begin no earlier than the 12-month anniversary of the loan; (4) Small Business Loans must carry an interest rate that conforms to Iraq financial market standards current at the time of the making of the loan; (5) Borrowers under this program must be majority owned by Iraqis and operated by Iraqis. No state-owned enterprises, but joint ventures are eligible so long as majority owned and operated by Iraqi private sector; (6) Borrowers must utilize the funds for legitimate business purposes; (7) Note that borrowers do not need to be “small businesses”. Grantees may apply their own credit risk standards in making decisions whether or not to extend Small Business Loans; (8) As part of its due diligence and credit analysis process, each Grantee must produce a business plan for each Small Business Loan it intends to make including the following information on the borrower: (a) use of proceeds; (b) business description; (c) competitive analysis; (c) historical financial statements; (d) projected future financial statements (giving effect to the loan); (e) projected cash flow debt service coverage ratios; (f) description of management; (g) description of shareholders


Excluded Transactions: (a) Activities related to tobacco; (b) Activities related to the production of alcoholic beverages; (c) Drug products not certified by applicable health authorities; (d) Activities related to gambling; (e) Activities related to military


Administrator Responsibilities.  (1) The Administrator and the Grantor shall establish a segregated bank account in a reputable bank for the grant funds (the “Grant Pool”). The Grantor will have signature authority over the account which it will delegate to the Administrator in whole or in part at its discretion. The Grantor at its discretion may transfer all or a portion of available funds at any time into the Grant Pool for onward distribution to Grantees. The Administrator may only transfer funds from the Grant Pool in order to fund Small Business Loans and for no other purpose. The Administrator shall not transfer funds from the Grant Pool to pay any expense or fee or procurement on behalf of the Administrator or any third party. (2) The Administrator shall receive applications for Grants from potential Grantees.  Prior to forwarding application to Administrator, Grantee will review application and perform credit investigation on borrower.  If Grantee approves loan, then Grantee may forward to Administrator for apply for matching funds.  Each such application will include documentary evidence to demonstrate conformance with all items under “Grantee Criteria”, “Loan Characteristics” and “Excluded Transactions” but the Administrator shall not impose onerous or unreasonably burdensome requirements on the Grantee relative to compiling the application. The Administrator will use reasonable judgment in viewing the evidence but will not be required to confirm the accuracy or completeness of the evidence and will not be liable for any mistakes or omissions in the evidence. (3) Upon successful review of an application, the Administrator shall instruct the Grantee to disburse the amount of the Grantee’s own matching funds (50% of the amount of the proposed Small Business Loan) to the borrower. Upon evidence of such disbursement on a timely basis, the Administrator shall transfer the grant portion of the Small Business Loan from the Grant Pool directly into the account of the borrower. Payment of principal and interest on the entire Small Business Loan will be due to the Grantee, and the Administrator shall have no responsibility for ensuring the borrower’s performance under the loan agreement with the Grantee. (4) The Administrator shall require periodic reports from the Grantee on the performance of the Small Business Loans made with grant funds. The Administrator shall be empowered (subject to Grantor’s discretion) to preclude from further participation in the program any Grantee whose Small Business Loan portfolio performance is materially worse than the aggregate Small Business Loan portfolio, excluding the Grantee in consideration. (5) The Administrator shall not give preference in allocating Grants to particular Grantees. Applications for Grants shall be processed in the order received. Any Grantee may not submit more than two applications per week in order to allow all Grantees access to the Grant Pool. (6) The Administrator shall consult periodically with the Grantor on the progress and performance of the program; shall prepare and provide  Quarterly Utilization Reports to the Grantor no later than 15 calendar days after the close of a quarter; and shall provide other information whether in the form of reports or otherwise as requested by the Grantor to fulfill Grantor’s statutory and management responsibilities and objectives. (7) The Grantor in its sole discretion shall have the power to exclude any actual or potential Grantee from the program or limit participation in the program. If the Administrator believes that any actual or potential Grantee should be excluded or limited on the basis of financial, legal, moral or other valid reason, it shall promptly consult with the Grantor and carry out the instructions of the Grantor. (8) The Administrator shall not accept applications for grants from any Grantee under common control or ownership with the Administrator.

Start-Up, Implementation, Duration and Termination.  (1) The Administrator should be prepared to begin administration of the program within one week of signing the contract. The Administrator shall promote at its own expense the existence of the program with potential grantees in all areas of the country with the intent of achieving a reasonable geographic dispersion of grant funds.(2) The program will terminate at the end of one year. Any grant funds not expended by that time will be donated to a charitable organization for activities in Iraq, by decision of the Grantor after consultation with the Administrator. (3) The Grantor may terminate the Administrator at any time, with or without cause. If so terminated, the Administrator will be eligible to receive fees, in accordance with the contract, proportionate to its level of activity prior to termination date.

 Reporting Requirements.  (1) Quarterly Utilization Reports of the amount of grant funds used in the preceding period are required of the Administrator per information noted above. (2) Grant recipients may be subject to an audit during the 12 months that this facility is available.  This audit would be limited to review of the loans made under this program and their general administration and would be paid for by the Grantor using funds from the Grant Pool or otherwise at the Grantor’s discretion.
  
Oversight.  The Administrator will be accountable to Grantor for achieving tasks set forth in the contract. All tasks under the contract are to be carried out subject to the supervision, direction, and any necessary redirection by the Grantor.

Duration of the contract period: one year from Grant Award

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey has a requirement for specialized activities toward the development and implementation of geologic data retrieval, storage, display and dissemination for several groups in the Central Region Geologic Hazards Team.  These groups include the Geomagnetism Group, Information Technology Group and the national Seismic Network Group.  Extensive expert knowledge in seismological and geomagnetic data and applications and how the data are processed and prepared for dissemination is critical to this procurement.  Specific expert knowledge is required in 1) a Windows-based application called MagProc which has become the central data processing software for processing USGS magnetic observatory data; 2) Modules for converting the Earthworm system from its use in seismology applications to geomagnetism know as Magworm; 3) Oracle 9i database that will be the primary data storage and delivery system for the Geomagnetism Group; and 4) the Web interface that retrieves data from the Oracle database and displays it on the Geomagnetism Web page.  These are unique software programs and modules highly specific to seismological and geomagnetic data and applications.  Therefore, specific expertise and knowledge of these systems is required to insure that the programming code will be compatible with the nature and uses of these data.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: RESTRICTED TO 8(a) FIRMS SERVICED BY THE HAWAII SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION DISTRICT OFFICE AND OTHER 8(a) PARTICIPANTS WITH BONA-FIDE PLACES OF BUSINESS IN HAWAII. (No solicitation will be available. This is an announcement that is open indefinitely.) The Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC), Pearl Harbor is seeking interest from 8(a) program participants serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii to participate in a Blanket Ordering Agreement (BOA) Program. (If you are currently a Hawaii-Based BOA Holder, no further action is required on your part.) BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific Division, Resident Officer in Charge of Construction, Pearl Harbor, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. Annually, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only, to a chosen few contractors for submission of a proposal. If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement but there is a threshold of not less than $25,000 that can be placed on a Task Order with a maximum of $3,000,000. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only. The anticipated construction work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. The anticipated construction work to be covered under the BOAs include, but is not limited to, new construction, minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, alterations, repairs (emergency and routine)), handling of hazardous waste and material, maintenance, mechanical, electrical, heating/air conditioning, painting, paving, earthwork, demolition, installing pipelines, and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items). The NAICS Sectors covered under the BOA are for work performed in the NAICS Sectors 233, 234, and 235 for construction. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military and government installations on the Islands of Hawaii, the Territory of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. freely-associated island-nations of the Republic of Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia. The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years with the Government's right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c). The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. If a firm is exiting from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will be terminated. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. SOLICITATIONS: The contractor may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. LIMITATION OF ORDERS: The range will be from $25,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000. SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: (1) Provide 8(a) Certification. (2) Registered in the Department of Defense (DOD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. (3) Licensed/Bonded and fully capable to perform construction work under the NAICS Code Series 233, 234, and 235. (4) Provide resumes indicating the qualifications of key personnel of the Design-Build Team, if applicable, to include principals (design and construction), project manager (design and construction), registered professionals for each design discipline (architect, civil engineer, structural engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, and fire protection engineer), and sustainable design consultant, if being considered for design and/or design-build projects. Provide a narrative that describes the Design-Build Team?s internal communication system used to ensure a successful project, if being considered for design and/or design-build projects. (5) Provide up to three references of completed projects within the last three years for EACH NAICS sector that reflect your firm?s performance and qualifications similar in size and general scope and the possible complexity to which the firm would like to be considered. A request for a BOA may be denied if a contractor has an Experience Modifier Rate (EMR) greater than 1.2 and/or an incidence rate higher than 5.0. To register in the DOD CCR database, go to the CCR website at http://www.ccr2000.com/, go to "Start New Registration", and follow the directions for registration. All requirements under the BOA Program will be offered via E-mail or posted on NAVFAC's Electronic Solicitation (E-Sol) website at http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil for downloading. This will normally be the only method of distributing solicitation documents. All BOA holders are encouraged to visit the E-Sol website frequently for the solicitation documents issued under the BOA Program. All BOA holders shall create an account for each solicitation in which they wish to participate at the website http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil to ensure that they are notified of updates or amendments to the solicitation as they occur. No other notice of solicitation activity will be provided to interested offerors. BOAs will be processed in the order in which a complete evaluation package is received. BOAs will be used for competitive purposes. Unless you respond to this synopsis or subsequent synopses, which will be issued periodically, you will not be able to participate in this BOA program.

     Currently we need two of the bench top gas chromatographs in Pittsburgh, to be utilized in our mobile gas analysis lab, with two portable gas chromatographs being available to be used as a rapid, first response.  The remaining bench top gas chromatograph will be used in the Physical and Toxic Agents Division Denver lab (which is used to respond to mine emergency operations in the western part of the United States).  This request for gas chromatographs is also a request for field service/repair kits for each instrument.  Our current gas chromatographs do not have these kits available, which makes field repair of the instruments impossible.  The availability of these service/repair kits will certainly enhance the operational aspect of these instruments.

The replacement RSD shall be completely compatible with the existing RAST probes fitted in the SH-60B and MH-60R series helicopters, and with the RAST track currently fitted to all USN LAMPS III capable ships.  Companies capable of providing a modification to the system as described above are encouraged to identify themselves and provide a description of the proposed modified system for review.  It is anticipated that a procurement of test articles with options for production articles will be conducted in the future under the Foreign Comparative Test Program.  The goal of the test program is to procure the item which best meets the user needs.  Respondents are cautioned that a formal solicitation may not necessarily result from this RFI.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITTION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARTION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUCEMENT.  This Request for Information is for information and planning purposes only.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to either procure any services or pay for the information received. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to issue a solicitation to procure courier services in support of the Office of Personnel Management, Center for Investigations Service, located in the Theodore Roosevelt Federal Building (TRB), Washington, DC.  These services will include pickup and delivery of freight (3 cubic feet, locked footlocker type trunks weighting approximately 40-80 pounds) from OPM headquarters, 1900 E. Street NW, Washington, DC to the following locations:

1.  OPM-Center for Investigations Service, 7630 Little River Turnpike, Suite 400, 
     Annandale, VA 22003.
2.  OPM-Center for Investigations Service, 6525 Belcrest Road, Suite 600, Hyattsville,
      MD 20782.
3.  OPM-Center for Investigations Service, 4205 Suitland Road, Suitland, Suitland MD
     20746.
4.  OPM-Center for Investigations Service, 2231 Crystal Dr., Suite 410, Arlington, VA 
     22202.

Timeliness of the deliveries is a major priority as is the secure transport and handling of the material.

A fixed-price contract will be awarded for a base period of one year with two (2) one-year options for a total period of performance not to exceed three (3) years.  The contractor will provide secure, accountable courier service between OPM headquarters, 1900 E. St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20415 and the OPM-Center for Federal Investigative Services Office listed above.   
This service will take place weekdays (Monday-Friday) between 8:00 AM and 2:30 PM, except the 10 federal holidays.  Freight (sealed boxes) will be picked up from OPM headquarters between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM and delivered to the established exchange locations.  At each established location an exchange will take place dropping off and picking up freight to be returned to OPM headquarters.  Deliveries and pickups at the established locations will occur between the hours of 9:00 AM and 2:30 PM.  Freight from the established exchange locations will be returned to OPM headquarters by 2:30 PM each day.  There are occasions that will require pickup to be delayed.  The vendor and OPM contact officials will arrange scheduling of any delayed pickups.  Furthermore, there may be occasions that require delivery on a holiday, weekend, or times other than normal hours of operation, when no employee(s) are available to receive the delivery.  On those occasions the delivery will be made on the next business day, or by mutual arrangement between the landlord, receiving facility and contractor.  Additionally, where the vehicle will be left unattended for an hour or longer the contractor must provide an OPM approved “permanent” secure holding area to maintain the material until the delivery is accomplished.  The minimally acceptable “permanent” secure holding area must be fully enclosed and deter theft and/or vandalism to the freight.  Whenever the freight is to be left unattended for a period of less than one hour, it must be in an OPM approved “in transit” secure holding area.  The minimally acceptable “in transit” secure holding area may be the transport vehicle so long as it is completely secured before leaving the vehicle unattended.  OPM will provide a security appraisal for both the “permanent” and “in transit” secured holding areas. 
Transport Vehicle (TV)
The contractor must ensure their TVs are secure in a manner to protect sensitive, but unclassified materials from theft or destruction.  The TVs must be closed, above average in reliability, safety, and energy efficiency for TV in their class.
TV must have their cargo compartment separated from the cab.  Cargo doors must be secured with a high-security locking device.
Additionally TVs must be minimally equipped with the following:
•	Two-way mobile radio or cellular telephone communications.
•	Lockable passenger compartment cab.
•	 AM/FM radio
OPM will provide security appraisals to ensure TVs are acceptable.
Only OPM may grant one-time authority to use a temporary “closed-type” replacement vehicle to prevent mission degradation.
Freight:
The usual freight from the Center for Investigations Service offices would be no more than (15), footlocker type trunks, locked, weighing approximately 40 pounds each, but could be as much as 80 pounds, and are roughly (3) cubic feet each.  The contents of the locker type trucks would consist of paper, magnetic tape, equipment, etc.  Some freight from the Center for Investigations Service may also be in sealed boxes.  The workload/volume is subject to change with little notice.  The Center for Investigations Service will attempt to provide a two-day notice to the contractor. 
Contractor/Driver Responsibilities: 
The contractor will provide drivers who will be responsible for loading and unloading at origin and destination and must be insured and bonded.  Furthermore, the contractor should have an OPM approved plan to secure the Governments’ information in case of unforeseen circumstances (i.e. – breakdowns or accidents) while en route between the OPM facilities.  The contractor should ensure the plan is disseminated to and utilized by its drivers.
Background Investigations:
All drivers, personnel, and passengers in the delivery vehicle(s) who could/would handle the freight must pass the appropriate level OPM approved background investigation.  The cost associated with all contractors background investigation(s) shall be incurred by the contractor.

As authorized by 5 CFR 731 and 736, the Contractor will provide qualified personnel with appropriate suitability investigations to meet the requirements of a sensitivity designation level of Critical Sensitive.  The investigative requirement is, at a minimum, the following:

Background Investigation (BI) - if no prior BI has been conducted on the contract employee or any prior BIs were completed more than five years ago; or

Periodic Reinvestigation (PRI) - if the Federal government has conducted a BI level of investigation on the contract employee within the last five years; or

Upgrade to BI (BGI) – if the Federal government has conducted a Limited Background Investigation (LBI) within the last two years.

OPM will require all contractor personnel to be investigated.  Background investigations will be adjudicated by OPM's Security Officer prior to personnel beginning work under this contract.  This requirement may be temporarily excepted as shown below.  

Within 30-days of contract award, Contractor shall make arrangements through the COR for EXPEDITED (35-day) OPM investigations on all proposed personnel to determine their suitability for employment.  This shall include providing the COR with the following completed documentation for each person to be investigated:

(1)	Standard Form 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions.

(2)	Original Fingerprint Card (FD-258);

(3)	Declaration for Federal Employment (OF-306).

Upon receipt of the required forms, the OPM Security Officer will obtain any existing reports of previous investigations and will determine if the personnel suitability requirements can be met by such investigations or if additional investigation is required.

Contractor is cautioned that current or previous investigation by the OPM or another investigative organization, e.g. the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO), will not automatically result in a favorable adjudication by the OPM Security Officer without the need for further investigation.

The Government reserves the right to make temporary exceptions to allow Contractor personnel to begin work or to allow limited access to a system after having examined partial investigatory data with some items incomplete.   If, at any time during the investigation, information that could result in an unfavorable evaluation is reported to the Security Officer, the temporary exception may be withdrawn pending resolution of the issue.

(a) The Contractor will pay for each required individual investigation.  The cost for the BI is $1,961.55; the cost for a PRI is $335.13; and the cost for a BGI is $916.30.

(b) Some typical disqualifying issues that can result in an unfavorable adjudication are:

Current drug or alcohol abuse;
Pattern of financial irresponsibility;
Improper or illegal sale of firearms;
Patterns of violence;
Patterns of dishonesty;

(c) The Contractor may, from time-to-time, seek advance guidance from the Government in cases where potential-disqualifying issues may be present.

The OPM is interested in knowing what the capability of the small business community is for performing work of this type.  Interested small businesses can submit their capability statements by E-mail, fax or mail to the original point of contact listed in this announcement.  Capability Statements should be submitted not later than 3:00 pm, July 16, 2004.  All Capability Statements received after the closing date and not postmarked at least five (5) days prior to the closing date, will be considered late and will not be given consideration.

<SUBJECT>B -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-DAVIS FOR THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE (NMFS).  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT IS TO ASSESS EFFECTS OF POLLUTANTS IN FISH INJECTED WITH SPMD EXTRACTS.  AFTER THE EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL, RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON THE EXPRESSION OF THE BIOMARKER ENZYME CYP1A IN FISH.  THE BIOMARKER CYP1A ACTS AS A MEASURE OF OIL EXPOSURE.  PASSIVE SAMPLERS (SEMI-PERMEABLE MEMBRAME DEVICES (SPMD) WILL BE DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE OILED AND UN-OILED PARTS OF PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND.  EXTRACTS FROM THE SAMPLERS WILL THEN BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THEIR POTENTIAL FOR INDUCING CYP1A ENZYMES.  NMFS WILL DEPLOY AND COLLECT THE PASSIVE SAMPLERS AND ANALYZE THE EXTRACTS FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTAMINANTS.  THIS STUDY WILL SUPPLEMENT THOSE CHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS WITH ATTEMPTS TO MEASURE THE BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO THESE EXTRACTS, TO DETERMINE IF INDUCIBLE POLLUTANTS ARE PRESENT.  TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, ALIQUOTS OF CONCENTRATED EXTRACTS FROM PASSIVE SAMPLERS WILL BE INJECTED INTO JUVENILE TROUT, LIVERS WILL BE HARVESTED AT TIMED INTERVALS, AND THE INDUCTION OF CYP1A ACTIVITY WILL BE MEASURED USING EROD ASSAYS.  THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR WILL CONDUCT INJECTIONS AND HARVEST THE LIVERS AND PROVIDE THEM TO ANOTHER CONTRACTOR.  AFTER ALL CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE MEASUREMENTS ARE COMPLETED, THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR WILL EVALUATE AND INTERPRET THE COMBINED RESULTS.  METHODS USED TO INDUCE CYP1A ACTIVITY IN FISH USING SPMD EXTRACTS WAS DEVELOPED BY DR. SPRINGMAN AT UC-DAVIS.  PREPARATION OF THE EXTRACTS FROM THE SAMPLERS AND THE MEASUREMENT OF EROD ACTIVITY ARE BOTH FAIRLY ROUTINE, BUT NO ONE HAS DEVELOPED THE EXPERTISE TO COMBINE THE TWO METHODS TO DETERMINE AVAILABILITY OF CYP1A STIMULATING POLLUTANTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT.  THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF LESS THAN $100,000.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is Amendment 0004 to the combined synopsis/solicitation for the Aerial Surveillance Platform and is issued for the purpose of providing questions and answers.  The proposal due date does not change.  Proposals are due 7 Jul 04, 2:00 p.m. Central  Standard Time (CST).  Q1: I have a question concerning the modality of data reporting for the solicitation.  My understanding is the following.  1.Submission of a technical cpabilities of the a/c separately.  2.Submission of document with pricing and past  performance with all the CLINS.  3.Submission of Executive Summary with contact info etc.  All of these documents should be sent to the attention of Debra Ennis.  May you confirm this or advise of the correct procedure?  A1: Technical capabilities of the total system as defined in the solicitation should be provided in a separate document.  No pricing or past performance data should be included in this document.  The price for the system, broken down by CLIN as set forth in the solicitation, should be subm itted in a separate document.  Information regarding your past performance should be submitted in a separate document.  This document should not contain any pricing information.  The Executive Summary should be submitted as a separate document and shall in clude the Company name, phone number, fax number, physical address, email address and company point of contact.  A summary of the company history (years in business, financial stability, capabilities as a company) with the listing of any parent, subsidiary  or joint companies with names, addresses, email and phone numbers shall also be included in the Executive Summary.  The proposal should be addressed to Carole Hubbard, Contracting Officer, and should be emailed to the following email address:  fwasp@redst one.army.mil.  (NOTE:  IF YOU HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL, PLEASE DO NOT RESUBMIT IT TO THIS EMAIL ADDRESS WITHOUT PROPER IDENTIFICATION THAT IT IS A DUPLICATE SUBMISSION OF A PROPOSAL SUBMITTED TO ANOTHER EMAIL ADDRESS, FAX OR VIA HARDCOPY MAIL.)  Q 2: Section 2 'Applicable Documents' lists among other things that FAA Part 23 Airworthiness applies and in Secton 3.0.1 'Aircraft Characteristic' there is the statement 'System must be certified to a minimum equivalent FAA  FAR Part 23 standard.'  Will air craft certified under CAR Part 3, the predecessor to FAA part 23, be acceptable for this solicitation?  A2: CAR part 3 certification is acceptable as long as the aircraft meets all other requirements for IFR and IMC operation.  Q3: What altitude are you lo oking at for your surveillance platform?  A3: There is no specific altitude required.  However, paragraph 3.0.3 of the solicitation requires a sensor that is capable of detecting a man-sized target at 3km range from 2,000 ft+ AGL.  Q4: We have a major prob lem, that I believe is common to any other bidder who would not have the aircraft already in Iraq.  Ferry flight expense and liability.  In fact we are not able to find any kind of insurance coverage for our pilots and the a/c hull, for Iraq.  We propose t hat the solicitation be amended to have the Iraqi pilots do the ferry flight.  After all they are to be trained, and they will fly missions in Iraq.  Else, what is the position of the US Army Aviation and Missile Command regarding the safety of our non-mil itary pilots?  A4: The solicitation will not be amended to have Iraqi pilots do the ferry flight.  Your concern is noted.  However, at this time, Iraqi pilots will be unavailable to perform the ferry flight due to other mission requirements.  Delivery of t he aircraft to Basrah International Airport is required.

<DESC>POC for this solicitation is LTC Karen Maskew, karen.maskew@cpa-iq.org.  Please submit any questions in writing only.  

Full text of this solicitation is available at the following website:  http://iraqcoalition.org/business.  Alternate location: www.cpa-iq.org.  Click on Business Opportunities, then CPA Solicitations, then search by Solicitation Number for W914NS-04-R-0158.

Description:  Business centers can help promote and expand a competitive and efficient private sector in Iraq.  Therefore, this program shall be designed to strengthen three existing business centers in major cities and support the establishment and growth of others. Each of the three existing business center will be established as an NGO which will perform fee-based services with the objective of becoming self-funding over time. The contractor will provide each center with a business plan, strategic direction, management oversight and specific task-centered support to build the management and technical skills of the Iraqi team at each center and support the development of each center as a leader in providing high quality, fee-based business support services to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in Iraq. With time, the centers must build a clientele and establish a fee structure that will cover the costs of the operation.  This goal will have an impact on the kinds of clients served and the level at which training and support services are provided.  
 
A complementary activity is to develop the umbrella organization to which the business centers belong, the Iraqi Business Centers Alliance (IBCA). Currently, IBCA exists as a web portal (www.iraqibusinesscenter.org)  with links to its member business centers and other information sources. The contractor will explore the extent to which IBCA can and should become an entity that creates synergies among the business centers beyond a common website. 

Another complementary activity to be developed and implemented through the business centers is the establishment of a Business Speaker Series. This service will provide a platform for the business centers to attract individuals to the center through addressing issues that are of interest given today’s business opportunities and situations; it should also be one of the vehicles to help the business centers move toward self-sustainability. 

Finally, the contractor must commit to provide, through the business centers, a level of financial and business consulting to enterprises seeking debt financing. These services will be provided to company managers and owners to address the growing need for greater understanding of the credit application process, preparation of financial statements and business plans, the nature and structuring of long-term borrowing, and other specific financial skills needed to manage a business.  The particular topics to be addressed will be determined and programmed by the contractor keeping in mind the quickly expanding demands that are now being placed on private sector businesses in Iraq to compete in a free market.

Throughout its efforts, the contractor must act in keeping with the objective of evolving the business centers into Iraqi organizations – managed and operated by Iraqis for the benefit of the Iraqi business community primarily, and only secondarily for the benefit of the international (including American) business community. 

Duration of the contract period: 15 months from Contract Award 

Procedures to be used in awarding the contract:  Written solicitations shall be prepared in accordance with Section L (pages 77-91), and submitted via e-mail to karen.maskew@cpa-iq.org not later than 1600 hours (Baghdad time) on 16 July 2004.  Proposals will be evaluated and awarded as specified in Section M (pages 92-95).  

The anticipated award date: 30 July 2004

<DESC>Amendment 0002:  RFQ HSCG38-04-Q-500023 is amended and provides the following additional specification information:  1) In order to accommodate testing low pressure components more precisely by more accurate regulation and larger scale gauges, some test stands have high and low side set-ups.  Low side is normally about 0 – 2250 psi and high side normally would go up to max rated pressure.  A dual sided machine is not necessary if the stand can adequately control/regulate/indicate pressure and flow rates for the entire range of 0 psi to maximum rated pressure.  2) The motor/pump test variable drive requires a motor test pressure port, a pump test supply port and return ports with flow rate and temperature monitoring – One (1) unloading pressure circuit port and Two (2) high pressure or full range ports (separated far enough as to test two individual components under the same test conditions, pressure and flow, etc., also one low pressure port, if needed, to accurately test low pressure components if stand cannot regulate and monitor pressures from 0 to 2250 psi. with adequate accuracy), and one static pressure port. 3) The test stand should have a cycling valve which will alternate pressure supply from two ports and have three positions; pressure side A – return side B, Off, and pressure side B – return side A. 4) The case drain circuit should be capable of regulating and measuring flow from the cases of hydraulic pumps and motors.  It should have a patch filter of 10 microns, regulate back-pressure from 0 to 140 psi, measure flow rate from 0 to 8 GPM, and monitor oil temperature. 5) Amperage required will be provided by the government as needed. Power requirements should be provided by the offeror .  The existing machine, which the government is looking to replace, has a 225 Amp circuit supply.  6)  The main component to be tested on this test stand will be a Constant Speed Hydraulic Motor which drives a 20KVA,  3 phase, 120 Volt, 400Hz generator.  Test requirements are 26 GPM @ 3000 psi and 10 GPM @ 4500 psi.  The purpose of requiring 40 GPM is so this test stand will not be operating at near maximum capacity during testing and shock loading, and to allow for future flexibility. 6) The variable speed pump drive unit should have a universal type drive mounting pad and be capable of up to 50 horsepower loading. 7) The term "manual/remote" is further identified as "local/remote" with "manual and/or local" meaning the indicated functions (flow, pressure, start/stop, temperature, etc.) can be set/adjusted/operated by the technician at the test stand.  "Remote" means these same functions can be set/adjusted/operated at an industrial remotely located computer control station supplied with the test stand.  The closing date for receipt of offers is not extended.****

<DESC>Amendment 001 to NRMAD00404154SLW
Salinity being a derivative of the temperature and conductivity of sea water, our coral reef monitoring requires a Conductivity precision factor greater than or equal to 0.0003 S/m accuracy with a 0.00001 S/m resolution. The Temperature must also have a 0.002 0C accuracy with a 0.0001 resolution. The instrument must be supplied with internal memory storage, internal integral pump, internal battery pack and must also have an external RS232 interface for communication to our data logger.
The CTD sensor records the conductivity, temperature and depth internally while simultaneously up loading the data via the RS-232 interface to our data logger, which transmits the data hourly via GOES satellite. If any problems arise and transmission to the GOES satellite is stopped or the external power drops below 12vdc, no conductivity, temperature or depth data is lost.These sensors will be deployed two to a station at all CREWS (Coral Reef Early Warning System) monitoring deployments in both the Atlantic and Pacific networks. One just below the surface and one at depth to record and transmit their respective environments. Required Specifications
Conductivity: Range 0 to 70 mS/cm, Accuracy 0.003 mS/cm, Resolution 0.0001 mS/cm Temperature: –5 to +350C, Accuracy 0.002, Resolution 0.0001 Depth: 0 to 20 meter Full Scale, Accuracy 0.1% of Full Scale, Resolution 0.002% Full Scale 
Memory: 2048k Byte non-volatile FLASH memory

<DESC>Solicitation Number SB1341-04-Q-0668 dated June 25, 2004 is hereby amended to respond to additional technical questions submitted. Question: The requirements list "Real-time video display of return image" and "Computer interface with capability for control of instrument and angular readings from Labview software".  Can you please elaborate?  Are you looking for the quoter to supply a software package for analysis of the Real-time image, or do you just want to insure that a computer interface is available for implementation at a later date?  Answer: The system must be supplied with a computer interface and Labview program which controls the autocollimator and reads the angular deviation.  The return image must be accessible to the user in real-time just as on a non-automated system. Question: Is the 80 thread-per-inch requirement on the fine-pitch adjustment screws a hard number?  Are more than 80 thread-per-inch acceptable? Answer: 80 thread per inch is the minimum requirement, finer pitch would be acceptable as well. The current response date, July 7, 2004 @ 3 pm local time, remains unchanged.
