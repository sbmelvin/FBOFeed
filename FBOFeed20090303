<p>NSN: 2840015275825PRPR FORWARD COMPRESSOR STATOR ASSY</p>
<p>P/N: 2215M15G01,</p>
<p>Description: The ITEM DESCRIPTION is: The compressor stator front case assembly consists of the following components</p>
<p>(1) Compressor stator front case halves (2) Six stages of vanes with shrouds (IGV through stage 5) and five stages with seals (stages 1 through 5) (3) Five stages of removable rub liners (4) Stage 5 bleed air manifolds (5) Four stages of vane actuation rings The compressor stator front case is split into upper and lower halves, which are joined by bolted horizontal flanges. This allows for removal of upper stator only for access to compressor rotor for blade replacement. The compressor stator case lower half has borescope ports at stage 4 and stage 8 for installed engine inspection.</p>
<p>There are four stages of variable vanes: inlet guide vanes (IGV), stage 1, 2, and 3 vanes. These vanes have removable shrouds and seals. There are two stages of fixed vanes, stages 4 and 5.</p>
<p>These vanes are in multiple vane sectors, which slide into circumferential slots in case. These stages have removable inner seals and retainers. Bleed air manifold castings are bolted to casing aft of stage 5 vanes. Stage 5 compressor air travels from flowpath into a forward manifold for use as low pressure turbine (LPT) cooling air, and into a larger aft manifold for use as customer bleed and engine anti-icing air. This aft manifold has pressure-operated valves to prevent reverse flow of bleed air. The FUNCTION is Direct airflow at optimal angles onto the stages of Blades that immediately follow each vane sector. The variable vanes also assist in reducing compressor stalls. The DIMENSIONS are: Nominal diameter is 36.00 inches Height ~36.00 inches Weight ~ 90.0 lbs The MATERIAL consists of titanium.</p>

<DESC><p>The 61st Contracting Squadron, Los Angeles AFB, CA intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for acquisition for replacing entry doors in Bldg 270 and 271 at Los Angeles AFB, El Segundo, CA. The Government is soliciting for the award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract. This proposed contract is being considered as a set-aside under a small business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 238290. The size standard for NAICS 238290 is $14.0 M. The government is interested in all small businesses including (8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that are interested in performing this requirement. The government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small business) anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. The Government will use this information in determining its small business set-aside decision.
<p>This project consists of replacing the store front doors for Bldg 270 abd 271 because existing doors are difficult to open and close due to wind and internal building pressure with same, similar, or equivalent sliding electric doors. The Contractor will also be responsible to install applicable security equipment for the doors and meet ADA standards and requirements. Doors will have sensors that will open when an individual approaches from either the interior or exterior of the building. The Performance Period for this project is estimated to be one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days after receiving the Notice to Proceed. The magnitude of this project is estimated between $100,000 and $250,000. <br />The evaluation technique to be utilized for the contemplated award of the issued solicitation is Performance Price Trade-Off (PPT). Under PPT, past performance will be evaluated. The Government anticipates the issuance of the Request for Proposal in March 2009 and anticipates a closing in April 2009. The target award date is May 2009.</p>
<p>Interested parties should register online and subscribe to receive procurement announcements related to this solicitation by entering the website at http://www.fbo.gov. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for release of the solicitation package. To be eligible for contract award, offerors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Columbia-Cascades Area Office, Ephrata Field Office (EFO) has an immediate need and intends to negotiate one sole-source contract for enhanced security patrol services at the Columbia Basin Project and on associated Reclamation lands of the Columbia Basin Project.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services.  Reclamation has determined under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, to negotiate a contract with Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) to provide support and assistance of security patrol services to be performed over 200,000 acres of federally owned land within the Columbia Basin Project.  The required services would manage public use, protect facilities and resources, protect wildlife habitat, curtail vandalism to Project works, and halt pilfering of artifacts and other antiquities found on Reclamation land.  Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) is the only security entity that is currently providing security patrol services within the Columbia Basin Project on Washington state lands that would establish a cost sharing arrangement with Reclamation.  Their mission requires enforcement of State laws during the course of patrol services performed by WDFW officers.  Although this contract is not for law enforcement services, Reclamation will receive benefit from such enforcement, since law enforcement services would not otherwise be performed on Reclamation lands and facilities.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to Julie Mathews via email at jmathews@pn.usbr.gov or fax 208/378-5108. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this announcement will be considered by Reclamation.  A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.The anticipated period of performance under this contract will be a base year with the possibility of four 1 year option periods, for a total of up to 5 years.  To take advantage of business opportunities with Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) and the Department of the Interior (DOI) you must register your firm with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov or call 1-888-227-2423.  Contractors are required to have a Dun & Bradstreet number (DUNS) in order to be registered in the CCR database.  Lack of registration prior to award may make an offeror ineligible for award.  A contractor can receive a DUNS number by calling Dun & Bradstreet at (800) 333-0505.  Internet registration takes approximately 72 hours; mail-in registration takes approximately 30 days.  Contractors must complete an annual Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the following:  Several models of Sun andSky-Scanning Spectral Radiometers (Sun Photometer) and necessary parts for the repair,maintenance, and upgrade of the Sun photometers; tracking robot; and advanced controlbox.  These sun photometers monitor aerosol optical properties and provide uniformdatabase for long term characterization of aerosol optical properties within NASAsglobal climate change program.The period of performance for this contract will be for one (1) year.NASA/GSFC intends to issue a Request for Proposal NNG09274168R for this requirement on asole-source basis to CIMEL Electronique.  The authority for Other than Full and OpenCompetition is 10 US.C2304(c) (1). Only one responsible source.AERONET is an internationally federated network of sun photometers that has grown from 6instruments in 1993 to approximately 450 instruments today.  It has grown due tostandardization on all aspects of the program.	This includes data processing, datameasurement protocols, calibration procedures and scientific equipment used.  Withrespect to the latter, one fundamental radiometer produced by CIMEL Electronique, theCE318, has been the only instrument used in and designed to the specific requirements ofthe AERONET program.As demonstrated by the shadow band network and satellite remote sensing in general,prompt delivery of the data for analysis is fundamental for obtaining a comprehensive,continuous data base and allows assessment of the collecting instruments health andcalibration. In order to achieve this goal, minimize costs and expand the coverageglobally, the project uses the simple and inexpensive Data Collection System (DCS)operating on the geosynchronous GOES, METEOSAT and GMS satellites providing nearly globalcoverage in near real-time at minimal expense.With well over 100 sites the sun photometer must be able to consistently transmit dataunder a wide variation of climate conditions.  Because this is a global network, theinstrumentation must be able to withstand harsh weather conditions and still be able totransmit data reliably.  In addition to the requirement to withstand climate, theinstrumentation should be portable and easy to install in the field. Because of theremote locations and the availability of power to the photometers, the instrumentationshould have low power requirements.  The CIMEL 318 family of sun photometer operates on5watt solar panels.  Due to the magnitude of this global network and the almost constantflux of instruments being calibrated and shipped out to sites the instrumentation shouldbe light weight.  The CE318 family meets this requirement by weighing in at less than20kg.Interested organizations my submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. EasternStandard Time (EST) on February . 2009.  Such capabilities/qualifications will beevaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct thisprocurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetitive basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the Government.

The use of a patient's own lymphocytes as a treatment for metastatic cancer is an approach that is being actively pursued in clinical trials in the Surgery Branch, NCI. Current and recent clinical results indicate that these cell transfer therapies are among the most effective treatments known for certain patients. Ongoing protocols on the Surgery Branch are investigating the use of subsets of TI L to improve and extend this therapy approach. 

The Cell Production Facility of the Surgery Branch, NCI, is required during the production of each patient-specific cell treatment to adhere exactly to the standard operating procedures, including the exclusive use of approved reagents and materials. Each protocol requires a separate, FDA approved, Investigational New Drug (IND) application that is held either by the Surgery Branch or the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP). Each cell based treatment is approved by the Clinical Center and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on a detailed and formalized protocol. The only available clinical grade system for these studies is the Miltenyi CliniMACS apparatus and associated GMP-approved magnetic beads. The Surgery Branch has undertaken extensive preclinical validation and optimization using the Miltenyi apparatus for the reagent requested (CD8 microbeads) and included detailed protocols in the IND applications.

The aforementioned critical clinical-grade reagents are required for the clinical protocols within the Surgery Branch of the NCI and are manufactured and distributed solely by Miltenyi Biotec Inc. The reagents are required for use under multiple clinical protocols conducted by the Surgery branch, approved by the IRB and FDA, and included as part of the following IND# BB-8709.

<DESC>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) anticipates awarding a contract to an organization or organizations to develop standardized BOLD fMRI and ASL methodology and software for assessing brain function longitudinally with two developmental domains in typically developing children with an age range between infancy and 18-years-old.   

In a relatively short time, adult functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research has grown rapidly and made important contributions in understanding cognition and neurobehavioral disorders. In contrast, the functional neuroimaging research involving children and adolescents is quite small and limited. In a recent review of PubMed articles published in the past five years, 210 functional neuroimaging articles involving children were identified. Of these articles, 92% involved adolescents 18 years or older and 98% involved sample sizes less than 15 per group. The control groups in these studies are often matched to the target group and therefore not a representative sample of typical development. These factors increase the likelihood of both type I and II errors and make it impossible to generalize findings. Larger-scale studies are needed in order to make more reliable interpretations of pediatric fMRI data. 

The project shall address development of a standardized methodology and associated software for blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI and arterial spin labeling (ASL) acquisition in typically developing children from the ages of newborn to 18-years-old. The contractor shall obtain brain perfusion studies across the infant to 18-year-old age range.  In addition, the contractor shall develop a standardized method of investigating brain-behavior development using BOLD fMRI and ASL within two developmental domains, develop software to integrate BOLD and ASL data, collect brain activation data using these methods on a specified range of children within the larger range of infancy through 18-years-old, and analyze it longitudinally to look at developmental changes.  The contractor shall provide the scientific community with an initial database of these fMRI ASL data, provide the users of the database with the protocols and software developed and provide protocol descriptions and any software for tasks developed for the project.
 
The primary objectives of this project are to develop standardized BOLD fMRI and ASL protocols for use with typically developing children, and recruit and assess children between the ages of infancy and 18-years-old for brain perfusion studies using ASL and passive fMRI.  In addition, typically developing children in an age range specified by the contractor will be assessed longitudinally through integrated fMRI and ASL using two developmental brain activation tasks.  No child will be sedated or given medication to reduce movement while being scanned.  To meet these goals, the contractor shall develop a standardized method of investigating brain perfusion rates and brain-behavior development, provide the scientific community with protocols, software, and an initial database of the representative fMRI-ASL data, provide the users of the database with the fMRI and ASL protocols and software and provide protocol descriptions and any software for the developmental tasks designed for the project.    

Additional details will appear in the Request for Proposals (RFP) to be issued in approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the date of this publication of the announcement.  The RFP will be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) website:http://www.fedbizopps.gov, through the NICHD website:http://www.nichd.nih.gov/grants/index.html.

<CONTACT>Matthew L Packard, Chief, NIAAA CMB, Phone 301-443-3041, Fax 301-443-3891, Email packardm@mail.nih.gov - Patricia N. Hanacek, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-6226, Fax 301-443-3891, Email hanacekp@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) entitled Mechanisms of Behavior Change Initiation (MOBCI) for Drinking Behavior.  NIAAA is soliciting proposals for new, high risk approaches to traditionally intractable alcohol-related problems through the development of mechanism-based strategies that induce maladaptive drinkers to initiate and sustain a change from maladaptive drinking behaviors towards more healthful drinking behaviors.  NIAAA is looking for opportunities that will result in entirely new or quantum improvements in both the theory and methodologies used to understand how to induce sustainable, positive change in maladaptive drinkers.  Although the long-term goal of this initiative is to develop strategies for sustained, positive drinking behavior change, this BAA focuses on the initiation of change as an initial step towards this goal.  However, if suitably justified, this BAA does not discourage proposals that incorporate theory and approaches that look at both initiation and maintenance of positive drinking behavior change.

This BAA is soliciting proposals for two types of projects, denoted by Category A: MOBCI Research Projects and Category B: MOBCI Coordinating Center. 

 Category A: MOBCI Research Projects.  The present BAA is soliciting proposals for innovative, foundational, systems-oriented research aimed at diagnostically relevant, quantitative, mechanism-based, dynamical models of drinking behavior. The purpose of this BAA is to inform the design of strategies to cause initiation of sustainable, positive drinking behavior change.  Of particular interest is breakthrough research that uncovers and explicates the mechanisms and associated controllable variables underlying such change, at the following three levels of observation and analysis: 
           Neurophysiologic factors: individual neurophysiology and relevant biology,
           Intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive, psychological, affective and behavioral) factors, and 
           Immediate interpersonal factors: individual immediate social ecology (e.g., family, friends).

Multi-level, multi-scale mechanisms are an emphasis area for this BAA.

Category B: MOBCI Coordinating Center.  In order to accomplish MOBCIs goals, NIAAA expects that there will be a need to support the incorporation and use of advanced analytic and modeling methods among Category A projects.  The transdisciplinary integration of existing and new databases is of particular note in this context.  NIAAA seeks to actively foster collaboration and sharing of approaches and data sources in order to enhance both the immediate success of all participants and the long-term contributions of MOBCI.  Hence, Category B calls for proposals that would provide significant collaboration, archival, integration, and analysis services for the Category A projects. 

NIAAA anticipates awarding multiple contracts based on technical merit, availability of funds, and programmatic balance.  NOTE:  In contracts awarded as a result of this BAA, the Statement of Work will be proposed by the offeror and negotiated and accepted by the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA, intends to modify contract N68936-07-C-0004 on an other than full and open competition basis to change the required 8 fleet-fieldable prototype units identified in CLIN 0002 to 9 developmental StrikeLink (A) units and the associated data packages and documentation for the purpose of preparing a manufacturing baseline for future units.  The StrikeLink (A) units provide the Harrier Fleet with a Variable Message Format (VMF) communications capability that is interoperable with other existing DoD airborne and ground systems.  This procurement is a sole source to Stauder Technologies, Inc., 114 Mexico Ct, Saint Peters, MO, 63376-5102.  Stauder Technologies has specialized in the application of DoD communications and has developed and implemented algorithms in a distinctive software package for the Target Location Designation Hand-off System (TLDHS)/StrikeLink ground station program used in conjunction with the StrikeLink (A) project which is predicated on the use of the already identified ground station.  Stauder Technologies has developed the software package for the TLDHS/StrikeLink system and has unique and in depth knowledge, experi! ence, capability, and understanding of the AV-8B's current ATHS system that is not available by any other known contractor.  Additionally, Stauder has already designed, developed, and delivered 2 lab prototype units and 3 flyable prototype units under CLIN 0001 of the contract thus showing they have the unique capability to produce the units within the AV-8B environment and therefore the only contractor who can perform the modification and the documentation within the delivery schedule.  The services shall be performed at the contractor facility in Saint Peters, MO and on-site at the NAWCWD China Lake.  The contract term will be extended an additional 30 months and the SOW will be revised to reflect this change.  Award will be made on or about 10 April 2009.

This is a synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a synopsis for the procurement of twenty-eight (28) Wire Rope Isolators with the following technical requirements:  CLIN 0001:  Overall Requirement:  It is a requirement to provide shock and vibration isolation for the Non-Line-of-Sight Launcher System (NLOS LS) aboard the Littoral Combat Ship.  NLOS LS System Description (mounted system):  This overall mounted system will be approximately 45" x 45" x 75" (W x D x H), weighing approximately 3,650 lbs.  Lateral stabilization will be provided by GFE, and will result in a total lateral stiffness of ~5,600 lb/in in each of the lateral axes, which acts only in tension (no stiffness when in compression).   Expected deck natural freq! uency is between 14 - 20 Hz.  Schedule Requirement:  Must have isolators at NSWCDD by 1 June 2008, preferably by 11 May 2008.  Technical Requirements for shock/vibration isolators:  Form/Fit.	Less than 240 lbs total per mounted system (less than 60 lbs per isolator if x4 isolators are used).	Width must be less than 12".	Length must be less than 21".	Height must be less than 9.5".	Isolators must be capable of mounting around the perimeter of the base of the system (not in center of system's footprint).  Shock.	Mount must be capable of supporting a minimum of Grade B shipboard shock isolation in accordance with MIL-S-901D.  Transmitted shock in vertical axis must be less than 20 g's.  Transmitted shock in lateral axis must be less than 5 g's.  .	Mounted item must sway in the lateral axes less than 3".  Vibration.	Mount must be capable of supporting MIL-STD-167 shipboard vibration qualification of mounted item.  .	Mounts' natural frequency during shipboard vibration, where typical deflections are roughly +/- 0.02 to 0.03", must be less than 15 Hz.  Crossover frequency, where mounts begin to attenuate vibration, must be less than 17 Hz.  Engineering Support.	Vendor must be able to provide load-deflection data for the recommended mount when in compression, tension, shear/roll, 45 tension/roll, and 45 compression/roll.  This data must include at least 3 data points between 0 and 0.1" of deflection.  .	The system must meet shock requirements when the above data is used to model the system in NSWCDD's dynamic shock model.  .	Vendor must be able to provide shipboard vibration analysis demonstrating the compliance with the natural frequency requirement above.  This analysis must be at least roughly based on historical or empirical data from shipboard vibration tests performed on similar mounts.  This is to accurately account for the upwards frequency shift typically seen with wire rope isolators during very low-deflection vibration, for example.  This acquisition will occur via a Firm Fixed-Price (Commercial) contract.  Award will be made to offeror that represents the best value to the Government.  The closing date is 10 March 2009 at 2:00PM, Eastern Time.  Anticipated Award date is 11 March 2009.  All items shall be priced FOB-Destination, Dahlgren, VA.

<CONTACT>Brenda Burke, Senior Contract Specialist, Email burkeb@onr.navy.mil - Paul Armistead, Program Officer, Email paul.armistead@navy.mil
<DESC>Reverse Osmosis (RO) desalination has become the Navy standard for the shipboard production of freshwater since its introduction into the Navy in the early 1990s. RO plants have provided significant operational and cost benefits over conventional distillers which have been used on Navy ships since before the introduction of steam propulsion. These benefits include reduced monitoring and manpower requirements and significant reductions in operational costs including: reduced power requirements, independence from ship steam systems, reduction in the use of chemical additives, and large improvements in reliability and maintainability. Over the past two decades, there has been a large increase in the use of membrane based separations for both liquid and gas streams, much of this due to technical advancements such as improved membranes and pumps, novel membrane topologies and operational approaches, and staged separation processes. The Office of Naval Research has encouraged such technology development through the Expeditionary Unit Water Purification (EUWP) research program. It is the goal of this solicitation to further develop promising water purification and desalination technologies, on a component and not a complete system level, over a two year period to a readiness level that would be appropriate for consideration for use in a robust shipboard desalination system (technical readiness level 4 or 5). It is anticipated that there will be a second program to build complete shipboard desalination systems to a Technical Readiness Level 6, possibly using technologies matured during this program. (A description of Technical Readiness Levels is available at: http://www.onr.navy.mil/ctto/naval_needs.asp)

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Wayne State University (WSU), 656 West Kirby, 4001 Faculty Administration Building, Detroit, MI 48202-3622. WSU is the only known qualified source to perform this effort. US Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) desires to procure Low Temperature Research services in the study of diesel engine performance under extreme cold ambient conditions. The detailed efforts required include but are not limited to (1) piston skirt and ring structural deformation; (2) split injection of JP-8 and alternate fuels such as synthetic JP-8; (3) four color optical studies on temporal distribution of gas phase temperature, wall temperature, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and carbon in an optical, single cylinder diesel engine; and (4) studies on pilot and/or early injection fuel chemistry utilizing experimental data and CHEMKIN routines to determine dominant reaction pathways for cold start ignition. Market research indicated that WSU is uniquely capable and facilitized to meet TARDEC's research requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. Projected period of performance is eighteen (18) months. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>Fort Sheridan is located in Lake County, Illinois, approximately 25 miles north of Chicago, Illinois, and 18 miles south of the Wisconsin state line along the western shore of Lake Michigan. The overall facility currently encompasses 712 acres, consisting of surplus property (406 acres), property owned by the Navy (206 acres), and property owned by the Army Reserve (100 acres). The Post was established in 1887 to maintain civil order following the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 and labor riots in the city in 1886. The installation subsequently operated as a training post for troops serving in the Spanish-American War, the Mexican Intervention of 1913, World War I, and World War II. Fort Sheridan is bounded by Lake Michigan to the east, the city of Lake Forest to the north, the city of Highland Park to the south, and the city of Highwood to the west. The three residential and commercial communities surrounding the facility have a combined population of approximately 54,000 people and a combined area of approximately 30 square miles.<BR><BR>In 1988, Fort Sheridan was recommended for closure by the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission. The Post ceased military operations as an Army facility in May 1993 and closed under the BRAC process. The southwest quadrant and the northwest corner (approximately 100 acres) of the Post were realigned to the U.S. Army Reserve Command. In January 1994, the southeast quadrant and a small area on the central west side of Fort Sheridan (approximately 206 acres) were realigned to the Navy for use as housing and administrative offices. The combined Army Reserve and Navy properties have been designated as the Department of Defense (DoD) Operating Units (OU). The property that comprises the remainder of the installation, designated as the Surplus OU, primarily consists of the golf course and the historic district. All of the Surplus OU has been transferred to Lake County and the surrounding municipalities for reuse.  <BR><BR>This requirement is for environmental remediation, investigation of munitions and explosives of concern (MEC), long-term monitoring (LTM), and operation and maintenance (O&M) services (consisting of lawn mowing services, cap repairs and implementation of land use controls (signage))  at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. The sites covered under this requirement are Landfill #1, Landfill # 5 (including Coal Storage Area #3), Landfill # 6, Landfill # 7 and the former AAA Firing Point B.<BR><BR>Specifically, the Contractor will perform a MEC survey of two acres on AAA Firing Point B, complete the decision document process for Landfill #1, design and construct the remedy for Landfill #1, conduct LTM and maintenance of landfill #1 upon successful implementation of the remedy and conduct LTM and maintenance at Landfills #5 (Including CSA #3), #6 and #7.<BR>

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued approximately 9 March 2009 on-line only thru Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps); therefore requests for hardcopies of the specifications will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>Sources Sought for Translation of Rwandan Documents
<SOLNBR>192109CCO210001091
<RESPDATE>030609
<ARCHDATE>03072009
<CONTACT>Cheryl D. Hodge, Email cheryl.hodge@dhs.gov
<DESC>Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Office of Acquisition Management (OAQ)-Dallas is performing market research to determine available sources for translation, transcription, interpretation, and vetting of Rwandan documents.  Services may include other Great Lakes languages including Swahili, Kirundi, Runyankore, Rusoga, Rugwere, Ruramogi, and Luganda.  This is not a solicitation and no award will be made from this market research.
ICE requires the translation, transcription, interpretation, and vetting of various documents and interviews in Kinyarwanda and other languages of the African Great Lakes region.  Certain documents will require some degree of formatting.  Many documents will require certification that they comport with 8 CFR 1003.33.  Rwandan documents are frequently written in the native language of all Rwandans, Kinyarwanda.  ICE requires that the relevant documents be translated from Kinyarwanda to English with a hard copy in word format.  Vendor must possess the ability to provide an accurate word or phrase in another language (English) that is equivalent to that of the original language (Kinyarwanda).  Additionally, ICE requires the transcription of witness interviews conducted in Kinyarwanda.  Vendor must possess the ability to write out an exact copy of audio media from the language spoken on the media (Kinyarwanda) to another (English).  The resulting transcripts must then be translated from Kinyarwanda into English.  Some of these translations must be certified for use in court.  ICE may also require the transcription of witness interviews conducted in other Great Lakes languages including Swahili, Kirundi, Runyankore, Rusoga, Rugwere, Ruramogi, and Luganda.  ICE will also require interpreter services for conversations between ICE personnel and Kinyarwanda speakers.  Vendor must possess the ability to carry out oral translation from one language to another.  These conversations may range from very brief (minutes in the case of telephone messages and scheduling conversations) to long (several hours in the case of witness interviews). ICE may also require interpretation of conversations between ICE personnel and speakers of other Great Lakes languages including Swahili, Kirundi, Runyankore, Rusoga, Rugwere, Ruramogi, and Luganda. Some of the Kinyarwanda documents need to be examined by a Kinyarwanda translator who is familiar with Rwandan local court records so that the expert can determine which of the many records warrant translation into English.  Vendor must possess the ability to conduct a careful examination or scrutiny of the documentation to determine suitability.  After vetting of documents, the relevant documents require translation into English.  Some of these translations must be certified for use in court.  Interested vendors are to provide summary of experience in translating Rwandan to English to include vendor's familiarization with Rwandan local court records and past performance information . Past performance information should display translation, transcription, interpretation, and vetting of Rwandan documents to include services for Great Lakes languages including Swahili, Kirundi, Runyankore, Rusoga, Rugwere, Ruramogi, and Luganda similar to what is described in this market research. Interested vendors are to submit your information to: Cheryl.hodge@dhs.gov or fax to: 214-905-5458. Information shall be submitted by March 6, 2009, 3:00pm CST. Please refer any questions to Cheryl Hodge, Contract Specialist, at Cheryl.Hodge@dhs.gov.

Capability statements should be submitted to the attention of James E. Bryant, Jr., Contract Specialist, NIEHS, Office of Acquisition (OA), Contracts Branch C, Keystone Building, 530 Davis Drive, 1st Floor, Room No. 1043, Durham, NC 27713.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS: 

In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 35.017-3 Using an FFRDC, The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T)  Directorate is seeking sources for a potential requirement to make modifications to the current BioFlash biological detection system that is manufactured and marketed by Innovative Biosensors Incorporated (IBI).   The BioFlash equipment is based on the Cellular Analysis and Notification of Antigen Risks and Yields (CANARY) technology that was developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory (LL).  Requirements for this task include modifications and improvements to the existing BioFlash equipment, validation testing to ensure the ability of the BioFlash equipment to sensitively and specifically detect threat agents of interest, and a feasibility study to determine whether this equipment and technology can be rapidly developed and adapted for use by the First Responder community.
 

1.0 BACKGROUND 

DHS is charged with prevention and deterrence of terrorist attacks, and protects against and responds to threats and hazards to the nation.  DHS S&T, in partnership with the private sector, national laboratories, universities, and other government agencies (domestic and foreign), helps push the innovation envelope and drive development and the use of high technology in support of homeland security. 

DHS is committed to using cutting-edge technologies and scientific talent in its quest to make America safer.  DHS S&T is tasked with researching and organizing the scientific, engineering, and technological resources of the United States and leveraging these existing resources into technological tools to help protect the homeland. The First Responder community is in dire need of a fast, specific, sensitive, and reliable biodetection technology to aid in the evaluation of suspicious powders/suspect materials in order to facilitate public safety actions.  The First Responder Technologies Program has identified the BioFlash capability as a potential short term solution to this capability gap after some engineering modifications and operational validation of the technology by the First Responder community.


2.0 STATEMENT OF NEED

DHS S&T requires an organization that is knowledgeable with the IBI BioFlash equipment and the detection of aerosolized and non-aerosolized releases of biological materials in building spaces, the specificity and sensitivity and specificity of biological test methods, First Responder operational requirements, and assay interference issues.  

The Government is seeking an organization that can operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence, can fully disclose its affairs to the government, free from organizational conflicts of interest. 

This is not a Request for Quotation or a Request for Proposal. Any information submitted by respondents to this Request for Information (RFI) is strictly voluntary. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of market research and being conducted by DHS to identify qualified potential sources capable of fulfilling the above requirements. 

Interested parties shall submit a capability statement addressing the above statement of need. This capability statement shall not exceed three (3) pages in length.

RFI/Sources Sought closes in five days, 08 March 2009, at that time, capability statements are due via email to Contracting Officer Kristian Jovanovic: Kristian.Jovanovic@dhs.gov and Contract Specialist Neil Lanzendorf: Neil.C.Lanzendorf@dhs.gov.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to Alschuler Associates LLC, 3611 RTE 5, East Thetford, Vermont 05043. A purchase order will be issued to Alschuler Associates to complete phase III for developing an Implementation Guide, establishing vocabulary / acronyms, and related tools maintenance for Clinical Documentation Architecture (CDA) for Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network. Details of this requirement are further defined in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).The commercial services are being procured using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13, to exclude FAR Part 13.5. The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b). Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the continued need to match existing services for on-going studies being conducted by the CDC. Alschuler Associates LLC is believed to be the only source available that possesses intellectual property rights to proprietary information utilized in prior phases of the CDA for HAI reporting project (Phases I and II). Failure to acquire services from Alschuler Associates will preclude the use of such proprietary information during Phase III, thus will result in significant delay and possible termination of the Implementation Guide updates, the vocabulary development, and the enhancement of related tools required for CDC/ATSDR. Firms that believe they can provide the services as specified in the SOW are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer no later than 4:00PM Eastern Standard Time on March 12, 2009. Determination by the U.S. Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses. Inquires may be sent to Russell T. Oxford by e-mail at roxford@CDC.gov or by fax to 770-488-2044.

<SUBJECT>Proposed addition of Biodegradable Cups to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<SOLNBR>CP-03-03
<RESPDATE>031709
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Biodegradable Cups by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7350-00-NIB-0235 6 oz PLA Hot/Cold Paper Cup 1,000ct<br />7350-00-NIB-0238 9 oz PLA Cold Paper Cup 1,000ct<br />7350-00-NIB-0240 12 oz PLA Cold Paper Cup 1,000ct<br />7350-00-NIB-0241 16 oz PLA Cold Paper Cup 1,000ct<br />7350-00-NIB-0243 12 oz PLA Hot Paper Cup 1,000ct<br />7350-00-NIB-0244 16 oz PLA Hot Paper Cup 1,000ct<br />7350-00-NIB-0246 8 oz PLA Hot Paper Cup 1,000ct<br />7350-00-NIB-0248 8 oz PLA Hot Paper Cup w/Handle 1,000ct<br />7350-00-NIB-0249 12 oz PLA Squat Paper Hot Cup 1,000ct</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA, Fort Worth, TX.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Biodegradable Cups to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>7350-00-NIB-0235</p>

<p>EP-BSC12-WA<br />BO-PA-12<br />7350-00-641-4518</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Biodegradable Cups to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 17, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>BAA Announcement No. Tcc-09-HQ-BA-0001

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT 

I.	GENERAL INFORMATION

Agency Name
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 250 E Street SW, Washington, DC 20219.
Issuing Acquisition Office: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Acquisitions Management  Mail Stop FM-4, 250 E Street SW, Washington, DC 20219.

Research Opportunity Title  
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Research Initiative

Announcement Type and Date  
Initial Announcement  Research Initiative, March 2009

Research Opportunity Number
Tcc-09-HQ-BA-0001 

Pricing
Any resulting order that is established as a result of this notice will be separately priced and negotiated and include appropriate terms and conditions consistent with applicable regulations.

Response Due Dates
White papers will be accepted until July 31, 2009 5:00 pm EST.  Proposals will be accepted until August 28, 2009 5:00 pm EST.  Proposals will be evaluated and considered for funding on a continual basis.  

Research Opportunity Description 
The OCC is establishing this Research Initiative to maintain its support for high-quality research on modeling issues that arise from the use of complex non-experimental and often incomplete data  data typically used by banks to develop risk models for underwriting, account management, and regulatory capital purposes. 

Banks have been using statistical models for underwriting and account management purposes for several decades, however, until recently their models were developed using relatively simplistic statistical modeling techniques.  With the recent advancements in computing technology and the increased availability of loan-level data, banks are developing models for pricing, securitizations, and regulatory/economic capital that incorporate advances in theoretical and applied modeling procedures.  These include more complex sample designs and innovative estimation techniques that rely on advanced statistical, econometric and information theoretic techniques.  With the introduction of new techniques, however, the risk of model failure increases until the procedure and techniques as applied to banking are thoroughly tested and evaluated and verified by an independent review process.

Although the primary responsibility for assessing the suitability of these models rests with each individual bank as part of their validation processes, bank supervisors increasingly will be required to understand the technical details of these models and, when warranted, recommend adjustments or enhancements to the model design as part of the supervisory process.  At the OCC, examiners rely on the economists in the Risk Analysis Divisions (RAD) to review these models and provide expert opinions regarding their use to OCC examiners and bank staff; and to train OCC examiners on certain aspects of model-risk analysis.  However, advances in risk-model techniques are developing quickly due to market reliance on risk-based pricing, the need to value portfolios of securitized loans, and the inclusion of risk measurement tools under the Advanced Internal Ratings Based approach of the Basel II Capital accord.  Many of the techniques under consideration by banks are too new or too specialized to be studied within the traditional university framework.  One mechanism to further the OCCs ability to review these models and provide expert opinions is represented by this broad agency announcement. 

The OCCs Research Initiative is seeking proposals that would provide an environment for cooperative research across multiple disciplines on joint work with applied researchers from such fields as business, economics, statistics, and finance to investigate alternative methods of developing models when the structure of the data is less than ideal.  The objectives of proposals to the OCCs Research Initiative should be one or more of the following:

1.	Research, evaluation and data development.  Planning, initiating and maintaining a program to engage in state-of-the-art research on data analysis, integrating econometrics, statistics and information theory.  The research program will focus on developing new ideas and new methods to analyze complex or incomplete and limited data.  Providing researchers with financial and intellectual support to carry on that research and foster an exchange of ideas.  
  
2.	Dissemination.  Disseminating research findings using a variety of mediums to inform the academic community, policymakers, and the public.  Organizing and conducting conferences and workshops on special topics related to relevant research.

3.	Training and education.  Training and providing funding support for graduate students and postgraduates to conduct research related to its research program.  Providing short courses, workshops, and training sessions in all areas of econometrics and statistical modeling.  

Reporting Requirements
Each award shall include the required technical and financial reporting requirements as described in paragraph 4 of Section V. 

Point(s) of Contact and Questions

OCC will review all white papers received prior to the deadline (7/31/2009).  Based on an assessment of the white paper, the OCC will provide prospective recipients a recommendation to either submit a full proposal or to not submit a full proposal. .     

Stage 2 -- OCC will evaluate all proposals received prior to the deadline (8/28/2009).

All proposals submitted under the terms and conditions cited in this BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated herein.  

 
2.	Submission of White Papers

White papers shall be submitted electronically to Catherine.Gleasman@occ.treas.gov.  The email subject line should contain the following: Tcc-09-HQ-BA-0001.

White papers received after the deadline of 7/31/2009 may not be reviewed.  

	Paper size when printed - 8.5 x 11 inch paper
	Margins - 1 inch
	Spacing - single
	Font  No smaller than Times New Roman, 10 point
	Number of pages  no more than four (4) single-sided pages (excluding cover letter, cover, and curriculum vitae).

	Identification of the research and issues
	Proposed methods 
	Potential team and management plan
	Summary of estimated costs
	Curriculum vitae of key researches

The white paper should provide sufficient information on the research being proposed (e.g., hypothesis, theories, concepts, methods, approaches, data collection, and measurement) to allow for an assessment as to whether a full proposal submission is warranted.

.

3.	Submission of a Full Proposal

Full proposals shall be submitted via email to the OCC Point of Contact.

4.	Registration Requirements  

There is a one-time action that an offeror must complete in order to be considered eligible for award, register with the Central Contract Registry (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov/).  An offeror may submit a white paper and/or full proposal prior to registering, however an award will not be made until the offeror has registered (see Section VI).  Applicants who are not registered with CCR should allow at least 21 days to complete these requirements.  It is suggested that the process be started upon initial white paper submission.  Questions regarding CCR registration may be directed to the OCC Point of Contact.

V.     EVALUATION INFORMATION 

1.  	Evaluation Criteria

Full proposals will be evaluated by an evaluation panel to assess whether the proposal is likely to meet the objectives of the OCCs Research Institute.  The assessment will focus on scientific merit (criterion a, below) and relevance and potential contributions to OCC (criterion b, below), although the other criteria (c and d below) may also be used in making the assessment.  The first two evaluation factors are of equal importance:

a.	Scientific merit, soundness, policy relevance and programmatic strategy of the proposal
b.	Relevance and potential contributions of the proposal to the objectives of the OCCs Research Initiative

The following criteria are each of lesser importance than any of the above two:

c.	Quality of the staffing, such as research experience and demonstrated research skills 
d.	Realism of cost

2.	Evaluation Panel

White papers will be reviewed by a subject matter expert who is a Government employee.  Full proposals will be reviewed by an evaluation panel chaired by the responsible Technical Evaluation Team (TEP) Chairman.  The evaluation panel will consist of subject matter experts who are Government employees.

3.	Selection Process

Full proposals will undergo a single stage evaluation procedure.  The respective evaluation team will review each white paper and make the recommendations for full proposals based on the white paper responses.  Award decisions will be made on an acceptable or nonacceptable basis.

4.	Reporting

In general, for each award, quarterly progress reports are required, which will summarize the technical progress and accomplishments during the performance period.  Specific reporting requirements will be included in each resulting award.

VI.	AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION 

Successful offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry before any award can be made from this BAA. Information on CCR registration is available at www.ccr.gov.  Questions regarding CCR registration may be directed to the OCC Point of Contact.

<DESC>Finding:

The computer equipment room lcated between the dental exam room and
the medical exam room is not provided with an independently controllable air
conditioning system. The room gets too hot all-year for proper operation of
the computer server and powered network hubs and switches. The heat 
producing computer equipment  operates 24-hr/7-day, whereas the building
HVAC operates 10-hr/5-day.


Scope of Work:

Provide dedicated, 3-ton split system air conditioning with controls for the
computer equipment room. Locate the outdoor condensing unit grade by
Doctors office, room 125. Provide a wall-mounted or ceiling-hung air handler
with a supply top register within the computer room. Distribution ductwork is
not required. Provide a secondary condensate drain pan and drain piping,
and extend to the existing drain in adjacent laboratory. Do not connect directly
to the existing drain to avoid entry sewer gasses. Install a local fusible
weatherproof disconnect switch for the outdoor unit and fuse in accordance
with the manufacturer's recommendations. Provide a local 1-pole disconnect
for the indoor unit. Energize from the nearest appropriate panel with adequate
capacity using 80 LF of 120 V wiring (3 #12 in 1/2" EMT) for the outdoor unit.
Locate a thermostat in the computer equipment room

<DESC>VISN 6, Centralized Acquisition Service intends to procure sole source with Covidien to upgrade the VISN 6 fleet of Puritan Bennett 840 Ventilators. VISN 6 standardized on Puritan Bennett 840 (PB840) ventilators in 2004 under a competitive FSS procurement.  This acquisition is to upgrade the existing PB840 ventilators at each medical center with the latest software upgrades available.  This will bring the ventilator fleet up to current commerical standards and will be less costly than procurring new ventilators. Covidien owns the proprietary rights to software and hardware and is the only source for these upgrades.  NAICS code 325411 applies to this procurement. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotations. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations. Interested parties that believe they can meet these needs must supply information about their capabilities no later than 5:00pm EST, March 10, 2009. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. This award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures. No solicitation will be made available. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The anticipated award date is March 16, 2009. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Telephone or faxed inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT  to Award Sole Source, Federal Supply Schedule Award

Fortify 360 Software and Maintenance

The Internal Revenue Service intends to award on a sole source basis a delivery order for a commercial item, to a single GSA Schedule contractor.  This purchase order will be made under the Authority of FAR Part 8.404  Use of Federal Supply Schedules.  

IRSs objective is to seek a solution for identifying, prioritizing and fixing security vulnerabilities in software and managing the business of ensuring application security.
This procurement is seeking to acquire Fortify 360 software to meet the following critical IRS IT Security Requirements:

 Detect the broadest array of vulnerabilities by combining static and dynamic analysis. 
 Provide multiple detection methods to select those that deliver the fastest results for IRS unique systems and environments.
 Ensure maximum code coverage with dynamic analysis by using existing test suites to identify vulnerabilities and to monitor applications in production.
 Correlate and prioritize results from static and dynamic analysis deployed at multiple collection points. 
 Fix vulnerabilities quickly and cost-effectively by easily sharing vulnerability insights among security and development teams and integrating them into existing tools and processes.

The Fortify 360 solution is the only solution which meets IRS's complex source code analysis and reporting requirements.  This includes the capability to assess, monitor, and report the effectiveness of IRS's implemented technical security controls in accordance to policies and standards mandated by OMB and NIST.  Therefore, the product must be validated by NIST Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) program (http://nvd.nist.gov/scapproducts.cfm) and meet polices mandated by OMB M-07-11 Implementation of Commonly Accepted Security Configurations for Windows Operating Systems, OMB M-7-18 Ensuring New Acquisitions Include Common Security Configurations, and Treasury Memo: Enhanced Cyber Security Controls, dated December 20, 2007.  The Fortify 360 solution complies with these policies and standards.

This acquisition is for Fortify 360 software solution and professional services to ensure the successful deployment of that solution across the IRS enterprise.   The Fortify 360 solution is a proprietary software product owned and developed by the Fortify company.  Immix Technology Group is the only Federal Supply Schedule holder for Fortify 360 software.   

Questions can be e-mailed to Valerie.robinson@irs.gov.

Contractors are required to comply with applicable Federal and State workers' compensation and occupational disease statutes.

The amount of liability coverage on other policies shall be commensurate with any legal requirements of the locality and sufficient to meet normal and customary claims.</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers, in order of importance:</p>
<p>Technical - Technical evaluation ratings for the items listed in the Statement of Need. The ratings will range from Acceptable, Reasonably susceptible to being made acceptable, to unacceptable. A complete justification will be prepared for each rating.</p>
<p>Past performance- will be given an overall general assessment risk rating. Performance risk relates to the assessment of an offeror's present and past work record to assess confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements.</p>
<p>The following definitions will be used in assessing performance risks on a scale ranging from exceptional to neutral that most accurately describes the contractor's performance or situation.</p>
<p><br />SCALE RATING DEFINITION</p>
<p>E Exceptional Performance meets contractual requirements with many exceeded<br />To the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the<br />element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with no more<br />than a few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the<br />contractor were highly effective.</p>
<p>G Good Performance meets contractual requirements with some exceeded<br />to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the<br />element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with no more<br />than some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the<br />contractor were effective.</p>
<p>S Satisfactory Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual <br />performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor<br />problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were <br />satisfactory.</p>
<p>M Marginal Performance does not meet contractual requirements. The<br />Contractual performance of the element or sub-element<br />being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor<br />has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractor's<br />proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not<br />fully implemented.</p>
<p>U Unsatisfactory Performance does not meet most contractual requirements.<br />and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual<br />performance of the element or sub-element contains a serious<br />problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear<br />or were ineffective.<br /><br />N Neutral Performance was not observed or not applicable to the current<br />Effort being reported against.</p>
<p><br />Price - <br />(1) The Government will evaluate offers for award based on the realism and reasonableness of total price proposed for the solicitation.<br />(2) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussion. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best price, terms and conditions.<br />(3) Realism - Offerors are advised that unrealistically proposed prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating an offer from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. Realism accesses whether the proposed price is compatible with the scope of effort and the requirements of the solicitation.<br />(4) Reasonable is defined as a price that provides best value to the Government when considering current market prices, wage determinations included in the solicitation and technical capabilities of the offeror. Also a fair price should ensure the offer a reasonable profit commensurate with performance.</p>
<p><br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>Contract award will be to the offeror who provides the offer most advantageous to the Government. The lowest priced proposal may not necessarily receive award; likewise, the highest rated technical proposal may not necessarily receive the award.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 - EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (January 1999)</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing offeror's past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer, the offer or accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offertory must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. After determining that a complete and acceptable proposal has been received in accordance with the requirements documented in 52.212-1 and it's associated Addendum, offers shall initially be ranked according to price, including option prices if applicable, as identified on the Pricing Schedule (Supplies/Services pages) of this solicitation. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the proposed unit price for each Item to confirm the extended amount for each; all extended prices will be added together and this final total will be compared against the figure annotated by the offeror in the price schedule. The price evaluation process will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>B. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on each offeror based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances of efforts involving all engineering, design, labor, travel, equipment, materials, training required to provide a complete functioning C5/C17 Mobile Tail Enclosure that are similar or greater in scope than the effort described in this solicitation; see Addendum to 52.212-1 for a detailed description of the factors considered relevant to this solicitation. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past and present performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence/, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3. Past and present performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past and present performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence,"meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>C. In evaluating past and present performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>D. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating and is determined to be responsible, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>E. In the event that the government does not make an award pursuant to paragraph D above, the government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance assessment rating of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>F. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions contained in 52.212-1 and it's associated Addendum; information shall enable the evaluator to fully ascertain each offeror's capability to perform all the requirements contemplated by this solicitation. Offerors may be asked, at the discretion of the Government, to provide additional information and clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past and present performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past and present performance is defined as past and present performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>G. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also an ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: Michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The United States External Information Program-Afghanistan, (EIP-A) originated as an Afghan approved full-spectrum and sustained counter-improvised explosive device (C-IED) information campaign focused on separating the bomb makers and users from the support of the populace.   In 2008 funding for EIP was taken over by the U.S. Army and realigned to inform and influence undecided Afghans in order to accept the Government of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) as a legitimate government of the people, support the acceptance of the Afghan National Securuty Forces (ANSF) as legitimate security forces and enhance the perception an improved Afghan quality of life is controlled by their actions.  The Contractor must be able to develop, test, produce, coordinate dissemination of media products and report effectiveness of products in support of the 2009 program lines. This involves the synchronized and phased dissemination of approved billboards, flyers, posters, educational pamphlets or brochures, newspaper advertisements, radio messages, television advertisements and documentaries.  The selected media company will be the lead in the distribution of all media products.

Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be utilized. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation W912JC-09-R-5712 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This ID-IQ contract is to provide plastic and glass media for paint removal from Kansas Army National Guard vehicles. Base year contract begins April 2009 thru April 2010 with the option for four additional one-year periods. The additional one year contract options are exercised if the product performance and customer service from the contractor is deemed to be of a satisfactory or better nature.  

Estimated quantities/type: Both plastic and glass media will meet commercial standards. It is estimated that 27,500 lbs equals a calendar month of Type II UREA Plastic (Bead Blast Media Type 2, 10-20 Grit) and 5,600 lbs per calendar month of White Blast Glass Media (Number  Designation 2, course, Size Range 10-30, Partial Count 300,000/lb) is estimated for consumption. 

1. The minimum quantities to be purchased under this contract will be 82,500 lbs of Type II UREA Plastic and 16,800 lbs White Blast Glass media that is comparable to three calendar months of media as noted above for the base year and for any option years exercised in total.

The aforementioned media blast maximum quantities are based off of previous years usage for estimate purposes only and in no way entitles an awarded contractor to an equity adjustment if the maximum amounts are not met or exceeded. 

Pick-Up/Delivery Schedule: Media will be delivered to FOB Destination Readiness Sustainment Maintenance Site (RSMS) at Camp Funston Bldg 1598, FT Riley, KS 66442-0345. All deliveries will be upon order from the Government.

The details of the recycle plan shall include the facility location and the recycle process described in a detailed narrative with any needed illustrations, pictures or video to allow for a full understanding of the offerors recycle process.  Estimated turn around recycle time lines should be included in the offerors recycle plan.  The recycle plan described in detail will be forwarded to this agency must be included with all offerors submissions for award consideration.  Submitting a recycle plan does not guarantee technical acceptability.  

1. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will make the determination if a proposed recycle plan from the offeror submitting the RFP is legitimate. Any recycle program that is not deemed as legitimate by the EPA will not be considered technically acceptable and thereby removed from consideration for award.

2. The offeror will separately list each drum and the weight of each drum collected on the hazardous waste manifest and on the bill of lading.  The offeror must transport all spent media to their off-base designated recycling facility.  The recycling facility must forward the bill of lading from each container that has completed the recycle process to include the facility disposition report to the Waste Minimization Managers office under the Environmental Division at FT Riley of whom will compare recycled material reports with spent material leaving FT Riley.  This will be done to ensure the amount of spent media leaving FT Riley RSMS is equal to the spent media being recycled.  A second copy of these documents shall be sent to the KS RSMS for recordkeeping purposes.

3. The recycle process for the spent media must be recycled within the Continental United States and may not be sent for recycle outside of the US. The recycle program of the awarded company will be subject to audit without notice throughout the entire performance of the contract.

<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>

<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>Only price proposals submitted by offerors whose technical proposals are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for evaluation. Award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable, responsible offeror with acceptable past performance. The lowest price offer will be computed by adding the total price for the basic period. Proposed prices will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed in FAR 13.106-2 to determine price reasonableness.</p>
<p>The standard is met when:</p>
<p>The price is determined fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 12.209.</p>

<p>(ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products. <br />Other End Products: <br />Line Item No. Country of Origin<br />______________ _________________<br />______________ _________________<br />______________ _________________<br />(List as necessary)</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--</p>
<p>(1) ( ) In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) (The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.)</p>
<p>( ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror ( ) does ( ) does not certify that--</p>

<p>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>
<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>"After-relieved tax," means any amount of tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that would otherwise have been payable on the transactions or property covered by this contract, but which the Contractor is not required to pay or bear, or for which the Contractor obtains a refund, as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking effect after the contract date.</p>

<p>(e) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any after-relieved tax, including any interest or penalty.

<p>(f) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that was included in the contract and that the Contractor is required to pay or bear, or does not obtain a refund of, through the Contractor's fault, negligence, or failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer or to comply with the provisions of paragraph (i) below.</p>

<p>52.232-33 PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER-CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)</p>
<p>(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.</p>
<p>(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--</p>
<p>(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or</p>
<p>(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).</p>
<p>(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.</p>
<p>(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.</p>
<p>(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--</p>
<p>(i) Making a correct payment;</p>
<p>(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and</p>
<p>(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.</p>
<p>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--</p>
<p>(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.</p>
<p>(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p>(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.</p>
<p>(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
What material is going to be rotated?
We don't know what materials will be rotated.

Is this for etching or for cutting through?
It is for both etching and cutting through.

Is it etching alphanumeric characters, ie, ID numbers, serial numbers, etc or is it for rastering images and shapes?
This should be a CO2 laser (not YAG).
Raster and vector modes should be supported.

What is the minimum/maximum diameter of the material that will be loaded into the attachment?
Do not know the min-max diameter of materials

Can you give me a little more feedback on the end use of this? 
As the submission stated, we're looking for something with 120 Watts of power.  It should also be a CO2 laser (not YAG). 

I need clarification on line item 0002, Rotary Attachment. Please provide a specification for this item in order for me to adequately address the line item with my submitted proposal.
We don't have further specs on the rotary attachment.
For the size and power of laser cutter we're looking for, there is generally only a single rotary attachment option offered by manufacturers.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify additional questions in regards to solicitation:
<p>&bull; If individuals aren't able to attend the scheduled site visit on Thursday 5 March 2009 at 1:00, will they be allowed to provide a proposal? Yes, we will accept all proposals from responsible contractors.</p>
<p>&bull; The pictures show a concrete pad, does the contractor need to install this pad as a base? Yes, this base we would expect the contractor to install.</p>
<p>&bull; The pictures (provided in the 1st ammendment) show (3) core drilled bollards for impact protection, will the contractor have to install? Yes, the contractor would install.</p>
<p>&bull; The pictures show plant power dropping to the deck. Would the contractor be expected to make that power drop connection? The contractor will be expected to hook the box to the Scissor Lift System.</p>
<p>&bull; McGuire AFB will support the power supply 120volt and 460volts.</p>
<p>&bull; The pictures show convenience outlets on the platform. Is that provided by the AFB or the contractor? They are provided by the contractor.</p>
<p>&bull; The lowered height restriction of 14" severely limits the number of vendors who can make the lift. Would you accept a 15-1/2" or 16" lowered height? Yes. This shouldn't be too big of an issue.</p>
<p>&bull; Can a contractor build a low profile conveying system on top of it to make up the 1-1/2" to 2" difference? Yes, this should be acceptable.</p>
<p>&bull; The write would lead one to believe the conveyor raises and lowers independently of the deck so pallets can either be sitting on the steel structure, or on non-powered rollers. They will be sitting on the Non-Powered rollers only.</p>
<p>ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME AT THE PROVIDED ADDRESS.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1 - RFP  192109CCO21000082


The following Questions (Q) and Answers (a) are provided to clarify any issues which may potentially be confusing in nature. 

1.	(Q) The Sleeping Room dates located on the NSLD Washington, DC worksheet line items indicated April dates while the rest of the worksheet indicates September dates.  Which is the correct date to submit a proposal for?
            a.	The Proposal Workbook contained an error on the ESLD (Washington, DC) conference worksheet tab.  The Sleeping Room lines contained the wrong dates. The dates have been corrected.  Use the Revised version of the Workbook attached instead of the original Proposal attachment. The correct dates are for September and not April.
2.	(Q) Should my firm only submit the proposal workbook as our response?
            a.	The Proposal Workbook is necessary for consideration in the response however it is not necessarily the only submission that is expected in an offerors proposal.  Read the solicitation in its entirety as the solicitation includes the following information:  
1.	A completed Hotel Contract with non-commissionable meeting rates shall also be submitted with your proposal, along with descriptive literature to include sleeping rooms, meeting room space, diagrams and square footage, information (availability/cost) on amenities of hotel i.e., parking, shuttle services; transportation to/from airport, and menus.  As well as, A response to requirements listed shall be submitted on letterhead and must address all requirements listed in a separate technical proposal.

Background:  Attendees at conferences will not have personal travel capabilities and it necessary to evaluate accomodations which are to be indicated in each offerors response with the documents requested previously.

2.	Offerors are advised to reread paragraph 5 of the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation concerning the Government position on use of certain paragraphs within the Firms Commercial Contracts.  Additionally, any issues concerning any arbitration are to be conducted in accordance with the Federal Claims Act. 

3.	(Q) My firm can only provide services for one or two dates and/or locations. Can I submit a proposal for only those dates/location for which I can provide services? 

             a.	Yes.  It is not necessary to submit a proposal for all conference locations/dates to be considered. Proposals are requested from firms to provide services for any or all requested dates however, if submitting a proposal for any one given date then it is expected that all services for that particular conference are to be provided as indicated in the solicitation located within the Proposal Workbook.

The original combined synopsis/solicitation indicated that the action will be posted for 15 days. The correct calculation should read approximately 14 days.  

The original response date remains unchanged at 12:00 pm CST (Dallas) on March 12, 2009.  Proposals are requested to be emailed only to eva.fulton@dhs.gov. Proposals received after 12pm will be considered nonresponsive.

<p>---NOTICE--Closing date changed to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 6, 2009, 3:00 pm</span> local time.&nbsp; An amendment furnishing additional details is to follow shortly.&nbsp;------------</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement for a five (5) year, Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the Occupational Healthcare and Medical Services at NIOSH Morgantown, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, West Virginia.</p>
<p>
<p>Physicals at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are provided to the Health Hazard Evaluation Field Team members, Public Health Service (PHS) Commissioned Officers, Safety Office personnel and Facilities Maintenance personnel. All other employees have the opportunity to participate in the medical monitoring program. Those employees who elect to participate in the program are given physicals based on their age. NIOSH has a requirement for an estimated 135 Physical Examinations (i.e., physicals) per year and additional add hoc testing, add hoc vaccinations, and supplemental occupational health services.</p>
<p>NIOSH has employees that are part of the CDC Emergency Response Team as well as the PHS Commissioned Corps Readiness Team. These teams are involved in incident management activities to include the prevention of, preparedness for, response to, and recovery from terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major emergencies. Depending on the type and magnitude of the emergency, additional NIOSH employees not currently on the team may be called to respond to an emergency. This would require immediate medical services which would include a responder readiness (general fit for duty) medical clearance and may also include immunizations and/or respiratory medical clearance. It is essential that the contractor administering the medical surveillance program for the NIOSH-Morgantown facility be located nearby to the facility (within approximately 20 miles) or be able to provide services in that vicinity within eight (8) hours of request for services.</p>
<p>This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis as full and open competition.</p>
<p>The CDC expects a single award, firm fixed priced contract with a period of performance of five years.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at www.fedbizops.gov on or about February 05, 2009 and proposals will be due on or about 3:00 p.m. February 20, 2009. No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of perspective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOps internet site.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation VA-244-08-RP-0316 Amendment VA001Contractor question:  Please review Section 01-00-00  General RequirementsParagraph 1.25 - Instructions - C:  Contractor to provide manufacturers rep for instructions for an indefinite period of time.Paragraph 1.26 - Government Furnished Property, sub paragraph 1.26.G -  Contractor to furnish supervision of equipment install by a factory tech employed by the manufacturer for an indefinite period of time.Paragraph 1.27  - Relocated Equipment/Items, sub-paragraph 1.27.E Contractor to employ the services of an installation engineer who is an authorized rep of the manufacturer for an indefinite period of time. We just need to know who to call to get rates.  If these services are part of what you bought with the equipment, as implied by one of the VAMC staff yesterday, we just need to know that.Answer from GE:	Other than GE (either me or Gary Woods or both) attending construction meetings as needed throughout the construction phase of the project I don't know of any other representation that would be required during construction.  Once the room is done we would need the electrician to be available to pull feeder wires to our equipment during the install (with GE oversight of course).  Reason being is that our installers are not electricians and this stuff needs to be done by an electrician.VA Comment:	They need to tell us when the space is acceptable for their installation. The contractor will have to coordinate having his electrical sub on site during the portion of the install that requires wire pulling.  No other coordination should be required and the construction contractor will not have to obtain a contract with GE.  VA Specification Clarifications and Corrections:	Please note to all including the A/E that Spec Section 23 31 00 2.3 is to be deleted. Duct Lining is not permitted for Infection Control reasons. All insulation, sound attenuation, etc is to be achieved externally.Section 26 51 00 Interior Lighting at 1.4.C.1 Samples: The fixture types of samples to be provided are left blank. They should be types Z, WW and DLD.Section 27 52 23 Nurse Call/Code Blue Systems at 1.1.E lists the Project Manager/RE as the authority for contract changes.  It should read Contracting Officer is the only one who can make contract changes.Section 28 31 00 Fire Detection and Alarm at 1.6.I (Guaranty Period Services) states that the contract will be equitably adjusted under certain conditions. This section requires the contractor to verify the system during the 5 year guaranty period if the VA makes changes to the system. This is written for a Major Construction or New Hospital and will be reviewed for removal from the contract.

<DESC>Introduction
The Joint Improvised Explosives Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), which is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), provides the vehicle for the competitive selection of basic and applied research, and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement.  Contracts based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law (PL) 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  As the issuing agency, JIEDDO will not issue paper copies of this announcement.  Any proposal documents or other materials submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  It is the policy of JIEDDO and its contracting agencies to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  
Awards for submissions under this BAA are planned in Fiscal Years 2009 and 2010.  However, funds may not be available for all requirements under this BAA.  No contract awards will be made until appropriated funds are available from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  JIEDDO reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals in response to this BAA.  JIEDDO will not provide funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  
This BAA will remain open for no less than 180 days from the publication date.  Proposals may be submitted at any time during that period.  At the conclusion of that period, JIEDDO will either extend the submission deadline or publish a new BAA.  See Section I for more detailed information.  
Approach
JIEDDO will use a two-phased proposal selection process for this solicitation to minimize cost and effort of prospective offerors.  Phase 1 will solicit and evaluate proposal quad charts and white papers.  Section VII, below, provides detailed guidance on Phase 1 proposal preparation.  Section VIII provides information on the Phase 1 evaluation process.  Proposals found to have technical and operational merit during Phase 1 will be selected for Phase 2.  Submitters will be contacted with specific instructions for Phase 2, which will consist of technical meetings as well as more detailed presentations and submissions to the JIEDDO acquisition management process.  Subsequent to funding approval, full technical proposals may be requested.  
HBCU/MI and Small Business Set Aside
The Government encourages nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), minority institutions (MI), women-owned businesses, and historically underutilized business (HUB) zone enterprises as well as large businesses and Government agencies to submit proposals for consideration or to join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of the BAA will be set-aside for these special entities because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research and development in any specific requirement area.  The final determination will be made based on the relevance of the proposal to JIEDDO requirements, individual technical merits of the proposal, and budget constraints within the mission priorities.  To ensure full consideration in these programs, registration in the BAA Information Delivery System (BIDS), described later in this document, requires the appropriate business type selection as well as accurate up-to-date information.  
Limitation of Funds 
The Government may incrementally fund contracts awarded from this BAA as provided by FAR 52.232-22, Limitation of Funds.  Contracts awarded to proposals submitted under this BAA are anticipated to be 6 to 18 months in duration.  To facilitate incremental funding, submissions shall include the cost and schedule by a task-phased structure organized by fiscal year (October through September) with clear exit criteria, and shall be inclusive of all work to complete the effort including any options.  It is anticipated that the entire effort will be negotiated with the initial contract award.  
Technical Evaluation Support 
JIEDDO will use contractor support personnel in the review, evaluation, and administration of all submissions to this BAA.  All individuals that have access to any proprietary data shall certify that they will not disclose any information pertaining to this solicitation including any submission, the identity of any submitters, or any other information relative to this BAA.  They shall also certify that they have no financial interest in any submissions evaluated.  Submissions and information received in response to this BAA constitute permission to disclose that information to certified evaluators under these conditions.

3.	Sponsoring Agency Name:  JIEDDO
4.	Program Name:  Rapid Development of Counter-IED Capabilities
5.	Research Opportunity Number: BAA JIEDDO-09-01
6.	Response Date:  Offerors responding to this BAA may begin submitting responses on 28 February 2009.  Final submissions for all proposals to this BAA are due by 1600 hours Eastern Standard Time on 28 August 2009.  
7.	Definitions:
a.	An Improvised Explosive Device (IED) is defined as a device placed or fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals and designed to destroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract.  It may incorporate military supplies, but is normally devised from non-military components.  
b.	Counter-IED (C-IED) is defined as the collective efforts at all levels to defeat the IED system in order to reduce or eliminate the effects of all forms of IEDs used against friendly forces and non-combatants according to the mission.  It includes offensive and defensive measures taken to predict, prevent, detect, neutralize, and mitigate the IED threat, as well as train our forces to counter it.  It also includes operations to predict and prevent the IED network.  
c.	The PREDICT functional capability is the foretelling of activities associated with the IED manufacture and emplacement, to include: recruitment, information operations, financial transactions, transportation, manufacturing processes, and identification of the people associated with these activities.  
d.	The PREVENT functional capability is the targeting, interdiction, and elimination of enemy personnel (operators and bomb makers) and the associated infrastructure (facilities and supplies) that precludes employment of IEDs against military and civilian personnel.  
e.	The DETECT functional capability is the extraction of information from objects and activities associated with IEDs (fabrication, transportation, and employment) or components of IEDs and in sufficient time to achieve a favorable outcome.  
f.	The NEUTRALIZE functional capability is to provide the means to disable, disrupt or pre-detonate IEDs or their sub-components.  
g.	The MITIGATE functional capability is to lessen or minimize the severity of IED-related events through enhancement of protection.  New capabilities will enhance the protection of military personnel vehicles by mitigating the blast effects of IEDs.  
8.	Description of Opportunity:  The Department of Defense (DoD) solicits proposals for the development of innovative capabilities to defeat IEDs employed against U.S. and coalition forces anywhere in the world, but especially in Iraq and Afghanistan.  JIEDDO is seeking innovative counter-IED capabilities that can be rapidly developed, demonstrated, and deployed within 12 to 24 months from award.  However, JIEDDO is willing to entertain less mature systems with a potentially high payoff.  Proposals must address one of the following five solicitation areas:
a)	Detect, neutralize or mitigate person-borne IEDs (Section II).
b)	Detect, neutralize or mitigate buried IEDs or pressure initiation devices (Section III).
c)	Provide stand-off detection and confirmation of explosives or chemical compounds associated with explosives (Section IV).
d)	Detect, neutralize or mitigate explosively formed penetrators (Section V). 
e)	Any additional technology, information, or recommendations that would enhance existing counter-IED systems.
  
II.	STAND-OFF DETECTION OF PERSON-BORNE IEDs REQUIREMENTS
The most important and difficult aspect of the person-borne IED (PBIED) detection problem is reliable, verifiable interrogation of all individuals in an unstructured crowd at a large public event (e.g. a crowded market square).  JIEDDO is also interested in the more manageable problem of interrogation at controlled access points, with individuals queued up for interrogation by portal or other fixed-site technologies in a one-at-a-time scenario (e.g. an election polling station). However, it should be emphasized that this is a subset of the larger problem of the unstructured crowd, and does not represent a full solution. Queues represent targets of opportunity for bombers; therefore JIEDDO is primarily interested in solutions that address the crowd problem without requiring the cooperation or even knowledge of the individual being interrogated.
Due to the issues of occlusion, look angle, and the potentially large number of individuals present, no single sensor can provide adequate coverage. Therefore, JIEDDO would prefer a multi-sensor, system-of-systems approach in order to eliminate PBIEDs as a weapon system of strategic influence.  However, single sensor solutions that provide a desired capability will also be considered.
Vendors counter-PBIED proposals should specifically address one or more of the following focus areas:
a)	Multi-sensor architecture
(i)	Proposals addressing multi-sensor architectures should describe a software network backbone which: enables straight-forward addition of new sensors and computing resources to the system; is capable of auto-discovery of those sensors and computing resources; assigns computational tasks to available computing resources.
(ii)	Software developer kit (SDK): Proposals addressing multi-sensor architectures should include a SDK to allow plug-and-play addition of sensors by enabling sensor developers to rapidly complete a software control interface for new sensors.
(iii)	Proposed solutions should provide a graphical user interface (GUI) which enables command, control, and interface with sensors, computing resources, communications systems, operators and interdictors, as well as intelligent, simultaneous display of multiple sensor inputs and threat status for system area of coverage.
b)	Single- and multi-sensor algorithms for aided or automated threat detection
(i)	Proposals addressing detection algorithms should describe methods for exploiting sensor data to extract threat features in an automated or operator-aided fashion. Reduction of the operators decision cycle is of primary importance. 
(ii)	Solutions may include single- and multi-sensor detection techniques, and therefore should also address combined use of disparate sensor data to enhance probability of detection (Pd) and minimize false alarm rate (FAR). 
(iii)	Proposed solutions should address data transformation for multi-sensor algorithms. For example, imagery captured by sensors at different look angles to the individual being interrogated need to be transformed to correct for parallax and perspective differences to enable direct image comparison. 
c)	Personnel tracking software and sensors
(i)	Proposals addressing personnel tracking software and sensors should describe sensors to be used, and software for location and tracking of individuals in the area of coverage.
(ii)	Algorithms to enable situational awareness and tracking of all individuals in the area of coverage as well as hand off of individuals tracks from one sensor to another. 
(iii)	Video analytics software for analysis and prediction of individuals behavior and detection of suspicious inanimate objects, e.g., bags, backpacks, and boxes left by individuals.
d)	Threat-detection sensor technologies
(i)	Metal detection sensors
(ii)	Active or passive, imaging or non-imaging, millimeter wave (MMW) and terahertz (THz). Preference will be given to those proposed sensor technologies which operate in the 10-1200 GHz (0.01 to 1.2 THz) frequency range where clothing transmissivity is significant.
(iii)	Active or passive, imaging or non-imaging, infrared (IR) sensors
(iv)	Electronics sensors for non-linear junction (diode) detection
Vendors counter-PBIED proposals should specifically address their methodology to provide early stand-off detection of potential suicide attackers without providing undue alert to the attacker. Where appropriate, the detection proposal should include:
a)	Description of key detection signatures or observables, and why the vendor believes those key signatures to be unique and reliable. In all cases, information or empirical data on solutions dependence upon environmental conditions and clothing types will greatly assist JIEDDO in assessing the value of proposed solutions.
b)	Description of potential false alarm sources especially in high-clutter environments and how those false alarm sources will be mitigated.
c)	Description of expected probability of detection and false alarm rate, and their dependence upon range, environmental conditions and variations due to the body types of those being interrogated. For existing technologies, proposers are encouraged to provide test data in support of the expected performance of the proposed detection system.
d)	A clear statement of the current and end-state technical maturity of the primary detection methods.
Vendors should address interoperability, collateral effects, and any other issue relevant to the integration of the proposed system into a military operating environment.  

III.	BURIED IED & PRESSURE INITIATION DEVICE REQUIREMENTS.
Detection of Buried IEDs
Buried IEDs are emplaced underground with the intent to detonate beneath vehicles and personnel.  They are used on roadways, thoroughfares and choke points where intended victims are likely to pass over them.  Emplacements vary widely, but burial depth often corresponds with the net explosive weight of the device (i.e. larger devices can be placed more deeply).  Devices are frequently emplaced in locations that provide little visual evidence of their burial, such as previously existing or repaired holes and culverts.  
Initiation devices for buried IEDs vary, but the most common are pressure switches and command wires.   Pressure switches close a contact when compressed under a wheel or foot and may be armed by command wire or RC device.  
Detecting buried IEDs is a significant challenge.  JIEDDOs investments to meet this challenge will encompass technologies intended to directly detect the device in situ and technologies intended to detect signs of emplacement, either by coherent change detection or by identifying the characteristic signatures of disturbed earth and other artifacts.  System platforms may include ground vehicles as well as manned and unmanned aircraft.  
Detection of a buried IED from a ground vehicle must be completed before the vehicle enters the blast area or detonates the device.  The minimum safe detection range (stand-off distance) will vary with the type of operation being performed by the vehicle.  Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) operations are performed when a possible IED location has already been identified.  The EOD team interrogates the location to confirm the presence of an IED and removes or disables it.  EOD teams can loiter at the threat location for an extended period.  They may direct a detection system at the likely IED, potentially on a robot or interrogation arm.  EOD operations require that a system have a high probability of detection (Pd), but the detection range can be short and determination of a threat can be left to the operator.  
Route Clearance operations are intended to find and remove threats on frequently travelled routes.  While advancing along the route, the route clearance team can direct its full attention to discovering threats, and may proceed at a slow pace near likely threat locations.  Detection systems intended for route clearance require that threats be automatically nominated with high Pd in time for the operator to stop, and that the false alarm rate (FAR) be low enough to permit reasonable forward progress as determined by the mission and operators.  
Tactical and convoy operations require higher speeds and demand more of the operators attention, so a detection system will need to automatically find and identify threats independent of the operator at a distance that accommodates the vehicle speed.  Tactical and convoy scenarios may require a forward looking or closely linked airborne system.  A lower Pd may be tolerated.
Detection of Buried IEDs from air platforms benefits all ground forces regardless of mission, but success of an airborne system depends on meeting the size, weight and power requirements of the proposed platform, availability of the platform, rapid communication of IED nominations to ground forces, and viability of the required search CONOPs.  
JIEDDOs near term goal is to provide buried IED detection capability that is effective in EOD and route clearance scenarios in both theaters.  Our ultimate goal is to provide buried IED detection capabilities that are effective in convoy and tactical scenarios.  To accomplish our goals, JIEDDO will field a suite of systems that can provide buried IED detection capability to units in most operational scenarios. 
The technical issues associated with the various operational profiles are different, and solutions that address any part of the problem will be pursued.  All viable solutions will exploit signatures that are robust, distinct and persistent. The technical challenges include: 
	Penetration through air, pavement, and soil
	Identification of target signatures in clutter (natural or man-made)
	Identification of a wide variety of targets, including non metallic
	Automated threat classification
	Variations in sensor perspective and environment on consecutive searches
	Timely and clear communication of target location to ground forces
	Interoperability of sensor systems with other systems used in the operating environment
	Mitigation of collateral effects on friendly forces, civilians, and electronic infrastructure
Detection of Pressure Initiation Devices
Pressure initiators are often associated with buried IEDs emplaced on roadways, traffic choke points and other thoroughfares.  Common pressure actuators are fabricated from lightweight metal components and buried under thin overburden in the path of an intended victim.  Although they can be fabricated from most any metal component, they commonly use items like saw blades, dual conductor wires and commercial pressure switches.  Technical approaches should address situations where the metal content of the actuator is deliberately minimized.  Other components associated with pressure switches include batteries, command arming wires and radio control arming devices.      
Although detection of pressure initiation devices and detection of buried IEDs are different capabilities, frequent association of the devices in theater and similarities in detection technologies necessitate a strategy that encompasses both.  
JIEDDO must field systems to detect pressure plates in a variety of operational circumstances.  For route clearance and EOD operations, a high Pd is required, but a slower rate of advance may be tolerated.  For operations that require higher speeds, a forward looking or closely linked airborne system may be required, and a lower Pd may be tolerated.  
The technical challenges include: 
	Identification of targets in clutter (natural or man-made)
	Identification of a wide variety of targets
	Automated threat identification and classification
	Mitigation of collateral effects on friendly forces, civilians, and electronic infrastructure
	Interoperability of sensor systems with other systems used in the operating environment

IV.	STAND-OFF DETECTION & CONFIRMATION OF EXPLOSIVES 
Stand-off explosives detection is different and more challenging than stand-off explosives confirmation.  Explosives detection is defined as the ability to find explosives associated with a threat when there is no prior evidence of the presence of a target material or other cueing indicator.  Explosives confirmation is the ability to determine the composition of a material at a suspicious location.  Stand-off means that the explosives detection and confirmation should be performed at a distance far enough away from the suspect device that the operator or valued assets are protected should the device detonate.  The specific stand-off distance will vary depending on the specific scenario, but the main objective is to develop the capability to interrogate rapidly and accurately from a safe distance.  In terms of the JIEDDO mission, the most challenging aspects of this problem are the requirements to have a high probability of detection and a low probability of false alarms at relatively large stand-off distances in an environment that is contaminated with explosives.  
Stand-off detection of explosives is challenging. A key consideration to meeting this capability gap is that stand-off explosives detection is required for a wide variety of situations, including but not limited to personnel and vehicle borne IEDs in complex environments such as marketplaces, buried or hidden IEDs, and assembly and production facilities.  Ideal solutions should encompass detection of all potential explosives, both in the detection and confirmation mode.  However, the following categories are of particular interest:  bulk home-made explosives, and enclosed or hidden military grade explosives
Stand-off confirmation of explosives is not a standalone capability.  Cueing from another system or an observable is usually required.  In this context, cueing involves indicators that an explosive threat may be present and the need to perform stand-off explosives confirmation.  In general, this capability should provide wide area scanning capability and a preliminary indication of where the confirmation sensor should interrogate.  Cueing may be from the explosive itself, or other indicators (e.g. disturbed earth, etc.).  
Comprehensive solutions to address the stand-off explosives confirmation gap should include consideration of the following components:
	Sampling protocol:  when, where, and how often to interrogate in order to confirm the presence of an explosive threat.
	Discrimination:  the ability to link the presence of a chemical species to the presence of an explosive threat
	Selectivity and sensitivity:  the ability to detect the presence of an explosive threat in an environment already contaminated with explosives
As stand-off explosives detection and confirmation advances as a capability there will be a continuing need to increase the speed, accuracy, and automation of the detection process. Solutions could include:
	Improved algorithms:
	Aided or automated detection
	Cooperative use of multiple sensors and data cueing
	Hardware improvements:
	Increased range
	Increased resolution and selectivity
	Reduced size, up to and including handheld sensors for dismounted operations
	Novel approaches using new technologies. Examples include, but are not limited to:
	Capacitance Trans-Impedance Array (CTIA) detector based technologies
	Nanotechnology-based sensors that show promise for more sensitive IR and laser systems
	Effective sensors that are small, inexpensive and could be used for wide area surveillance by dispersal over an area of interest may be useful, but sensing of this type has the potential for unintended consequences such as environmental contamination, health effects, or other unforeseen outcomes that must be addressed.

V.	EXPLOSIVELY FORMED PENETRATOR REQUIREMENTS.
An explosively formed penetrator (EFP) is a class of IED designed to fire a shaped warhead that effectively penetrates armor at stand-off distances.  An EFP system has four major components: 
a)	Arming Switch.  This component arms or disarms the EFP.  More sophisticated EFPs use a radio-controlled (RC) device (e.g. cell phone or long range cordless telephone) to transmit a control signal.
b)	Trigger Switch.  This component triggers the explosive device.   More sophisticated EFPs use a victim operated trigger.  Less sophisticated EFPs use command operated trigger.
c)	Explosive Device.  The explosive device consists of four elements: a concave metal liner (the penetrator), case, base plate, and explosive charge (propellant).  The case is generally cylindrical and fabricated from commonly available materials (e.g. PVC pipe, steel pipe, etc.).  The forward end of the case is closed by a concave copper or steel disk-shaped liner, which forms the penetrator.  Generally military grade explosives are loaded behind the metal liner to fill the casing. A blasting cap initiator is placed though a hole in the base plate. The penetrator can reach speeds well over one kilometer per second with kinetic energy on the order of mega joules, depending on the design and type of explosive used.
d)	Camouflage.  This component conceals the EFP system.  
JIEDDOs requirement is to detect an EFP system from a moving vehicle while performing route clearance operations.  Detection of the EFP must occur in time to provide a safe stand-off-distance for the vehicles crew to react.  JIEDDOs goal is to detect multiple EFP components to increase the probability of detection and reduce the false alarm rate.  
To meet these goals, JIEDDO is looking for:
	Solutions that detect exploitable features on more than one of the EFP components.
	Phenomenology studies that identify exploitable features for detecting the EFP System.  A list of previous phenomenology studies is available in the JIEDDO reading room.
JIEDDO is interested in technologies that can:
	Detect or neutralize arming switches, focusing on RC devices and the associated electronics
	Detect or neutralize triggering switches and the associated electronics
	Detect the EFP explosive device using radar techniques
	Detect the EFP explosive device using acoustic techniques
	Detect the wires associated with a command wire triggered EFP 
	Concurrently detect and defeat EFP as a weapon
To enhance the detection of the EFP system, solutions should combine multiple detection and interrogation techniques on EFP components to increase the probability of detection and reduce the false alarm rate.

VIII.	PHASE 1 EVALUATION PROCESS
1.	Proposals are evaluated as they are received, not at the conclusion of the BAA submission deadline.  Upon receipt, proposals receive an administrative review for compliance with BAA Section VII, above, followed by an initial technical review.  Proposals are then evaluated by the technical evaluation panel, which normally meets on a monthly basis.  Proposals are not evaluated against each other.  After any necessary staff coordination, a recommendation to either accept or reject the proposal for Phase 2 is staffed to the JIEDDO Vice Director for approval.  
2.	Technical review panels will use the following selection criteria, in descending order of importance, when conducting proposal evaluations:  
a)	Addresses one of the JIEDDO C-IED requirements published in this BAA. 
b)	Overall scientific and technical merits; to include potential for successful performance of intended functions in an actual operational environment.  Proposals exhibiting technical or scientific innovation to solve a requirement are desired and, in such instances, a higher than average risk of initial failure may be allowable.
c)	The proposed solution provides a significant enhancement in operational capability compared to existing fielded systems.
d)	Offerors capabilities, experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives. 
e)	Proposed schedule to deliver a prototype that can be tested at a Government facility.
f)	Proposed cost.  
3.	Each proposal will be evaluated on its own merit and relevance to the descriptions of opportunity requirements (at Sections II  VI) rather than against other proposals.  
4.	Proposal submissions may be rejected for the following reasons:
a)	The submission does not comply with the guidelines listed in Section VII.  
b)	The proposed solution does not address a C-IED requirement;
c)	The proposed solution includes development or acquisition of an aerial vehicle platform which is not within JIEDDOs fielding authority.  
d)	The proposed solution does not provide a significant enhancement in operational capability compared to existing fielded systems.  
5.	Proposals submitted electronically to the BAA Information Delivery System (BIDS) website which are determined to contain classified information will be rejected and the potential breach of information security reported to the appropriate authority.  
6.	Proposal submissions that are determined to be offers of commercial items, as defined by FAR, 2.01 may be rejected from BIDS.  The FAR prescribes policies and procedures unique to the acquisition of commercial items.    
7.	The socio-economic merits of each proposal seeking a procurement contract will be evaluated in the context of the requirements described in this announcement.  The evaluation process will consider the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, HUB Zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, veteran-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this solicitation, 334511 (which corresponds with the standard industrial classification code of 8731), specifies a small business size standard of 750 employees or less.  A Small Business Subcontracting Plan prepared in accordance with FAR 52.  219-9 must accompany contract proposals that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small businesses.  Entities that must submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan for contract proposals that exceed $500,000 include universities/colleges, nonprofits, and large businesses.  Historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) and minority institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and/or join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or functionally separable areas of this technology for exclusive competition among these entities.

<DESC>Mandatory Demo FedBizOps announcement 25 February 2009

This amendment to notice N00019-09-R-0226 is to inform offerors that the STUAS/Tier II Flight Demonstration will be a mandatory component of the proposal for those offerors who intend to respond to the STUAS/Tier II Request for Proposal (RFP).  Because of the additional mandatory requirements of the Flight Demonstration, the Government has extended the deadline for submission of range safety clearance documents.  Offerors must submit hard copies of completed range safety clearance documents (attachments 1, 2 and 3, provided as part of the 22 December 2008 FedBizOpps announcement) postmarked no later than Wednesday, 01 April 2009 to NAWCAD China Lake Range Safety Office at the following address:

Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division BLDG 31455
Range Control Center Range Safety Office Code 52330MD
China Lake CA 93555
POC: Stephen R. Sutton

Offerors who have previously provided range safety documentation are not required to re-submit these documents.

Offerors are advised that any questions they have regarding the submission of range safety clearance documents shall be directed to the STUAS/Tier II Contracting Officer and are not to contact the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division Range Safety Office directly.  Contact information for the STUAS/Tier II Contracting Officer is:

- Art Amses (AIR 2.4.4.2) Contracting Officer
Email: arthur.amses@navy.mil

Attachments should include offeror point of contact information to include name, email address and phone number. A Range Safety point of contact will be assigned and will contact the offeror point of contact to facilitate checklist review and range clearance.

In addition, offerors are requested to email shipment confirmation to:

- Greg Oliver, PMA-263 Assistant Program Manager for Test and Evaluation
Email: gregory.oliver@navy.mil
- Art Amses (AIR 2.4.4.2) Contracting Officer
Email: arthur.amses@navy.mil

Do not include completed attachments unless email can be encrypted with PKI technology.

While the Government intends to conduct the flight demonstration phase on the Naval Air Warfare Center (Weapons Division) (NAWCWD) China Lake range, the Government reserves the right to change the location of the flight demonstration venue as required in order to accommodate changes in source selection planning and/or range availability due to department prioritization.

If the venue changes, notification and instructions will be posted to the FedBizOps and PMA-263 websites.


Proposal submission will be required prior to participation in the Flight Demonstration.  The Government anticipates providing 45 days for offerors to submit proposals after release of the RFP.  The Government intends to commence the Flight Demonstration approximately two weeks after the RFP submission deadline.  It must be emphasized that all STUAS/TIER II offerors should plan on making their systems available to begin the Flight Demonstration at that time.  Specific Flight Demonstration start dates will be provided at a later date to each offeror individually.

In order to facilitate range planning efforts, the Government requests all offerors intending to submit proposals and participate in the mandatory Flight Demonstration to notify the STUAS/Tier II Contracting Officer, Mr. Art Amses, via email to the address provided above no later than 9 March 2009. 
Additionally, offerors who require the inclusion of foreign nationals as part of their demonstration team are required to have the foreign nationals submit an official visit request through their respective embassy in order to gain access to the NAWCWD China Lake range.  The point of contact for coordinating official visit requests for the demonstration is:
- Carolyn Schmidt, Foreign Clearance Officer (FCO). 
      Phone:  (760) 939-5472
      Email: carolyn.schmidt.ctr@navy.mil 
      Company information for Ms. Carolyn Schmidt: Naval Systems Inc. (NSI), 21491 Great
      Mills Rd, Suite 100, Lexington Park, MD 20653.  Phone: 301-737-1911
It is important to note that the official visit request process may take up to three months or more; therefore, potential foreign visitors participating at the request of a U.S. demonstration participant should begin this process immediately.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a sole source contract to Philips Medical Systems, North America Company, to provide maintenance on Philips' Ultrasound equipment in the Biomedical and Cardiology Departments at the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. This requirement is being set aside for other than full and open competition for the following reasons:
- Philips has conformance standards that are required by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).  The Philips conformance standards set specific configuration guidelines, calibration levels, and performance meters for radiological and ultrasound equipment, which are not available for third party maintenance technicians.  
  The NAICS code is 334510 and the Size Standard is 500.  The contractor shall provide preventative maintenance and regular maintenance on the said equipment.  The requirement will consist of one base year and four option years.  Services shall start 1 April 2009.   This procurement will utilize procedures under FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  This office will no longer issue a hard copy of the Request for Quote (RFQ); therefore, a copy can be obtained from website http://www.neco.navy.mil.  By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer.  By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this RFQ, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make a contractor ineligible for award.  Contractor! s may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at https://www.bpn.gov.    The RFQ should be posted on or before 17 February 2009. Please direct all questions regarding requirement via e-mail to Candace Reid at Candace.reid@navy.mil

<DESC>The purposes of this amendment are to provide answers to questions submitted and to extend the closing date of this notice to 6 March 2009, 3:00PM.
Answers to Questions:
1) Can we receive more details about the part that will be tested?   A drawing or simple sketch
Answer:  Item will be used as a component of the calibration suite of equipment used to calibrate the Electro-Optic Variant of the USMC Third Echelon Test System.  This office has no drawings or sketches to provide.
2) Does the system have only one use (to be used ONLY for the testing of this one assembly/part)?
Answer:  Item will be used as a component of the calibration suite of equipment used to calibrate the Electro-Optic Variant of the USMC Third Echelon Test System.  3) The specification states a need for a fiber fed source.  Is this really required or is mechanical phase shifting acceptable?NOTE:  We offer both wavelength shifting (fiber fed) and mechanical phase shifting.  The mechanical phase shifting solution is less expensive and will have a shorter lead time.
Answer:Item will be provided in accordance with specification stated in the combined synopsis/solicitation.  No deviation from the specification is desired.

<DESC>Responses to this notice are not considered offers and can not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  This RFI is for market research purposes only.  Respondents should not submit any proprietary information when responding to this notice.  Respondents should also note that the government will not return any information submitted in response to this notice.  The Government is not responsible for any costs incurred by respondents regarding any responses to this RFI.  Potential offerors must submit capability statements that clearly define the firms ability to perform the work stated in this notice in conjunction with the DRAFT Statement of Work and Sample Task.

The requirement for TESS is in response to the need for independent test and evaluation (IOT&E) of security technology equipment for the Office of Security Technology (OST) TSA.

The resultant contract will be the primary vehicle which OST will use to support performance of three key overall activities that must be accomplished to ensure successful IOT&E.   First is the ability to rapidly integrate, test, evaluate, model and simulate as required, and conduct recurring analyses and surveillance throughout the life-cycle of a variety of technologies, processes, and procedures in operational environments in a variety of locations and transportation venues (aviation and surface).  Second is the requirement to obtain and synthesize data, information, and reports from multiple sources and all phases of the acquisition cycle into one overall assessment of effectiveness and suitability of the system; and to assess and fully represent the level of risk associated with acquisition and use throughout the life-cycle.  Third is the requirement to independently assess the readiness of technologies and systems that may pertain to TSAs mission.

The contractor may have to perform work at up to 30 sites simultaneously at CONUS and OCONUS locations.  Contractor products will be used by OST and other entities within TSA, and a wide range of stakeholders from the aviation and transportation community.  Areas of responsibility will accommodate the test and evaluation functions through all phases of the technology life-cycle, for technologies applicable to aviation, air cargo, and surface transportation.  To support the requirements of the contract, the contractor must be able to quickly respond to diverse evaluation needs of the aviation and surface community through a multi-disciplinary approach and have a variety of technical expertise that must be either immediately or quickly available  depending on urgency of assignments.

Proposals with new and innovative technologies are needed which could enhance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge for the following areas: Proposals should address one of the technical areas listed: A: INTERCEPTOR TECHNOLOGIES, 1. Interceptor Systems, 2. Threat Negation Systems, 3. Simulation and Modeling Systems, 4. Command, Control & Communications Systems, 5. Networks, 6. System Interoperability, 7. System Requirements, 8. Other Applicable Interceptor Applied Technology Systems, and B: DEFENSE INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGIES (AIR, CRUISE MISSILE, ARMOR, FORCE PROTECTION AND OTHER), 1. Interceptor Systems, 2. Integrated Missile Systems, 3. Simulation and Modeling, 4. Target Systems, 5. Transportation Systems, 6. System Operational Analysis, 7. Battle Management Systems, 8. Fire Control Systems, 9. Directed Energy Systems, 10. Other Applicable Defense Infrastructure Applied Technologies. All development activities related to this BAA are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, Executive Order 12470, and/or DOD Directive 5230.25. This acquisition is not open to foreign firms. Any contractor or subcontractor considering this BAA can not have foreign nationals working on the effort. Foreign Nationals (also known as foreign persons) means any person who is NOT a citizen or national of the US; or a lawful permanent resident; or a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C 13 24b(a)(3). In order to streamline the proposal process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a formal BAA proposal, it is requested that the offerors first submit a summary concept paper for evaluation. From this summary concept paper the Government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described is of interest to the Government and whether a formal proposal would be likely to succeed. The Government, at its option, may provide comments that might be of assistance to the submitter in determining how or whether to submit a BAA proposal. Concept papers will be evaluated as soon as they are received. Acknowledgement of receipt of concept papers will not be made, and concept papers will not be returned. The Contracting Office will ask only those offerors with promising concept papers to submit full technical and cost proposals. The Contracting Office will notify offerors within 90 days of receipt of concept paper if a full proposal is requested. Concept papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data. All proprietary material should be clearly marked. The summary concept paper should state the proposed technical concept including the rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and its contribution to the USA AMRDEC. In addition, the summary concept paper should include a period of performance, anticipated cost and offerors past performance on Government contracts. The concept paper shall be limited to 5 pages (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), of English text with one additional page for technical drawing if necessary, and shall be in MS Word for Windows format. All concept papers, proposals, written communications or documentation<BR>concerning this BAA shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Andy Eiermann, via e-mail, andy.eiermann@us.army.mil, with a copy to Ms. Cathy Smith, via e-mail, Catherine.j.smith1@conus.army.mil. Facsimile proposal submission is not authorized under this announcement. No classified data shall be included in the concept paper or proposal. A review of concept papers by the Government will determine which efforts are of sufficient interest to merit a formal proposal. Concept papers will be evaluated based on technical merit and offerors past performance. Technical merit will rank significantly higher than past performance. If there is sufficient interest, a formal proposal will be requested. Contractors are not authorized to submit formal proposals unless invited to do so by the Contracting Office. This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make any award or to pay for any response preparation costs. The cost of proposal preparation or response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract and interested parties should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published. Proposals may range from theoretical studies to a proof-of-concept that includes fabrication, delivery and test of prototypes. USA AMRDEC is interested in receiving proposals for the research efforts described under this BAA. USA AMRDEC contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research in those technical areas listed above. Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract. Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee completion and/or level of effort type contracts are expected to be awarded. For planning purposes, awards are anticipated in the $100K to $30M range for the basic contract with a period of performance not to exceed 36 months. In addition to the basic contract, up to four options can be proposed. However, the total contract value (of each individual contract) for the basic and options cannot exceed $75M and the total<BR>period of performance for the basic and options cannot exceed 60 months. This includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of the final report. The following reports may be required (specific reporting requirements will be specified by the Government in the event a contractor is requested to submit a formal proposal): 1. FUNDS AND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPORT, DI-FNCL-80331/M, monthly; 2. TECHNICAL REPORT, DI-MISC-80508, as required and a one time Final report; 3. STATUS REPORTS, DI-MGMT-80368, monthly; 4. SOFTWARE PRODUCT SPECIFICATION (SPS), DI-IPSC-81441, as required; 5. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN (SDP), DI-IPSC-81427, as required. 6. PERIODIC PROGRAM REVIEWS (such as IPRs, SRRs, SDRs, etc.), as required. 7. DA Manpower Reporting Requirements. Long term proposals should contain a summary of the work contemplated for each 12-month period, so that contracts may be negotiated for an entire five-year project or for individual one-year increments of the total project. A detailed performance schedule for each discrete task must be included along with cost data to include labor-by-labor category. To be eligible for award of a contract, a prospective contractor must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, and ability to comply with the performance schedule. This acquisition is not open to foreign participation at any level. The Government will provide selected offerors with proposal content requirements. Proposal content and format shall contain and not be limited to: (1) Statement of Work (SOW): The SOW should be a concise document suitable for incorporation into a resultant contract. It should provide a qualitative description of the proposed work, which should be described in terms of advancement, improvement, or end product to be developed. The SOW should state the objectives to be achieved and how these objectives would benefit the Government. These objectives should be stated in terms of their potential usefulness to the Research & Development and Warfighter communities at and supported by the USA AMRDEC. The SOW should also include a proposed schedule detailing significant milestones and deliverables. (2) One page Resumes of the offeror's key personnel (including alternates, if desired) who will be involved in the research. Documentation of previous work or experience in the field of the proposer is especially important. (3) The type of support, if any, the offeror requests of the USA AMRDEC, such as facilities, equipment, or materials.

(5) Other direct costs. (6) Cost for consulting services, if any, showing number of days, daily rates, and estimated travel/per diem costs. The need for consulting services must be fully justified. (7) Indirect costs indicating whether rates used are fixed or provisional, and the time frames to which they are applicable (e.g., a fixed rate may apply until a specified date, after which the rate becomes provisional). (8) The fee, if any, which the organization proposes to assess the research project. (9) Subcontracts and material costs proposed must be fully supported and documented (written quotes, engineering estimates, etc). Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), it is the policy of the Government to enable small business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rendering services as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts, and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy. Subcontracting goals for small business are 40%, for veteran owned small business 3%, for service disabled veteran owned small business 3%, Hubzone small business 3%, small disadvantaged business (includes HBCUs/MIs) 5%, and women-owned small business 5%. These goals are to be considered when proposals are submitted. The Government anticipates that any contract resulting from this BAA will be funded on an incremental basis as provided by FAR 52.232-22  Limitation of Funds. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement. The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical merit, importance to agency programs, and funds availability. Management, cost realism and reasonableness, and past performance shall also be considered. The following factors will be considered in the evaluation of proposals received under this BAA. General: The government selection of the proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical and management in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance, using the areas and factors set forth below. The Government anticipates multiple awards under this announcement, though no minimum or maximum number of awards can be guaranteed. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Evaluation Factors for Technical Area: a.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to re-publish subject BAA. This re-published BAA shall remain in effect for a period of one year from date of this synopsis to 8 March 2010.<BR>A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the US Army Aviation & Missile Research, Development & Engineering Center (USA AMRDEC), Applied Technology Initiatives Directorate (ATI) is interested in receiving proposals from offerors capable of satisfying Government requirements for research and development utilizing new and innovative technologies to advance the capabilities in Applied Technology for interceptor technologies and defense infrastructure technologies. Proposals with new and innovative technologies are needed which could enhance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge for the following areas: Proposals should address one of the technical areas listed: A: INTERCEPTOR TECHNOLOGIES, 1. Interceptor Systems, 2. Threat Negation Systems, 3. Simulation and Modeling Systems, 4. Command, Control & Communications Systems, 5. Networks, 6. System Interoperability, 7. System Requirements, 8. Other Applicable Interceptor Applied Technology Systems, and B: DEFENSE INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGIES (AIR, CRUISE MISSILE, ARMOR, FORCE PROTECTION AND OTHER), 1. Interceptor Systems, 2. Integrated Missile Systems, 3. Simulation and Modeling, 4. Target Systems, 5. Transportation Systems, 6. System Operational Analysis, 7. Battle Management Systems, 8. Fire Control Systems, 9. Directed Energy Systems, 10. Other Applicable Defense Infrastructure Applied Technologies. All development activities related to this BAA are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, Executive Order 12470, and/or DOD Directive 5230.25. This acquisition is not open to foreign firms. Any contractor or subcontractor considering this BAA can not have foreign nationals working on the effort. Foreign Nationals (also known as foreign persons) means any person who is NOT a citizen or national of the US; or a lawful permanent resident; or a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C 13 24b(a)(3). In order to streamline the proposal process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a formal BAA proposal, it is requested that the offerors first submit a summary concept paper for evaluation. From this summary concept paper the Government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described is of interest to the Government and whether a formal proposal would be likely to succeed. The Government, at its option, may provide comments that might be of assistance to the submitter in determining how or whether to submit a BAA proposal. Concept papers will be evaluated as soon as they are received. Acknowledgement of receipt of concept papers will not be made, and concept papers will not be returned. The Contracting Office will ask only those offerors with promising concept papers to submit full technical and cost proposals. The Contracting Office will notify offerors within 90 days of receipt of concept paper if a full proposal is requested. Concept papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data. All proprietary material should be clearly marked. The summary concept paper should state the proposed technical concept including the rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and its contribution to the USA AMRDEC. In addition, the summary concept paper should include a period of performance, anticipated cost and offerors past performance on Government contracts. The concept paper shall be limited to 5 pages (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), of English text with one additional page for technical drawing if necessary, and shall be in MS Word for Windows format. All concept papers, proposals, written communications or documentation concerning this BAA shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Andy Eiermann, via e-mail, andy.eiermann@us.army.mil, with a copy to Ms. Cathy Smith, via e-mail, Catherine.j.smith1@conus.army.mil. Facsimile proposal submission is not authorized under this announcement. No classified data shall be included in the concept paper or proposal. A review of concept papers by the Government will determine which efforts are of sufficient interest to merit a formal proposal. Concept papers will be evaluated based on technical merit and offerors past performance. Technical merit will rank significantly higher than past performance. If there is sufficient interest, a formal proposal will be requested. Contractors are not authorized to submit formal proposals unless invited to do so by the Contracting Office. This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make any award or to pay for any response preparation costs. The cost of proposal preparation or response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract and interested parties should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published. Proposals may range from theoretical studies to a proof-of-concept that includes fabrication, delivery and test of prototypes. USA AMRDEC is interested in receiving proposals for the research efforts described under this BAA. USA AMRDEC contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research in those technical areas listed above. Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract. Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee completion and/or level of effort type contracts are expected to be awarded. For planning purposes, awards are anticipated in the $100K to $30M range for the basic contract with a period of performance not to exceed 36 <BR>months. In addition to the basic contract, up to four options can be proposed. However, the total contract value (of each individual contract) for the basic and options cannot exceed $75M and the total period of performance for the basic and options cannot exceed 60 months. This includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of the final report. The following reports may be required (specific reporting requirements will be specified by the Government in the event a contractor is requested to submit a formal proposal): 1. FUNDS AND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPORT, DI-FNCL-80331/M, monthly; 2. TECHNICAL REPORT, DI-MISC-80508, as required and a one time Final report; 3. STATUS REPORTS, DI-MGMT-80368, monthly; 4. SOFTWARE PRODUCT SPECIFICATION (SPS), DI-IPSC-81441, as required; 5. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN (SDP), DI-IPSC-81427, as required. 6. PERIODIC PROGRAM REVIEWS (such as IPRs, SRRs, SDRs, etc.), as required. 7. DA Manpower Reporting Requirements. Long term proposa  ls should contain a summary of the work contemplated for each 12-month period, so that contracts may be negotiated for an entire five-year project or for individual one-year increments of the total project. A detailed performance schedule for each discrete task must be included along with cost data to include labor-by-labor category. To be eligible for award of a contract, a prospective contractor must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, and ability to comply with the performance schedule. This acquisition is not open to foreign participation at any level. The Government will provide selected offerors with proposal content requirements. Proposal content and format shall contain and not be limited to: (1) Statement of Work (SOW): The SOW should be a concise document suitable for incorporation into a resultant contract. It should provide a qualitative description of the proposed work, which should be described in terms of advancement, improvement,<BR>  or end product to be developed.

Cost proposals must contain certifiable cost or pricing data, and shall be in sufficient detail to allow direct and indirect rate verification. The budget must include the total estimated cost of the project. The estimated project costs must be broken down for e  ach year of the program to show the following: (1) A list of participants, not necessarily by name, showing the time and number of direct productive person hours (DPPHs) to be charged by principal investigator(s), research associates, and assistants, and the total amount per year to be paid to each from the project. For proposals from universities, the time and amounts to be charged should be identified by academic year and summer effort. (2) An itemized list of permanent equipment showing the cost of each item. Permanent equipment is any article of non-expendable tangible personal property having a useful life of more than two years, and an acquisition cost of $500 or more per unit. (3) A general description and total estimated cost of expendable equipment and supplies. (4) Contemplated expenditures for travel with brief explanation. Travel budgets that exceed $1,500 per principal investigator per year or that include foreign travel or travel by other than principal investi  gators will require special investigation. (5) Other direct costs. (6) Cost for consulting services, if any, showing number of days, daily rates, and estimated travel/per diem costs. The need for consulting services must be fully justified. (7) Indirect costs indicating whether rates used are fixed or provisional, and the time frames to which they are applicable (e.g., a fixed rate may apply until a specified date, after which the rate becomes provisional). (8) The fee, if any, which the organization proposes to assess the research project. (9) Subcontracts and material costs proposed must be fully supported and documented (written quotes, engineering estimates, etc).
