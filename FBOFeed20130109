In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. 20.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command, National Capital Region, on behalf of the Office of the Judge Advocate General, US Army Legal Services (OTJAG) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 8.405-6(a)(2) and FAR 11.105, to Hotdocs Corporation, Linden, UT, 84042. <br>  <br> Hotdocs will provide continued maintenance of its proprietary software. This software is needed to create Powers of Attorney and other documents with specific language for each State.  The software company ensures that the language for each State document is in compliance with State law and regulations. OTJAG has procured Hotdocs software in the past and this contract is to pay the annual maintenance needed for updates, upgrades, and service support.   <br>  <br> The PoP will be for a one year. <br>  <br> A failure to continue support or any unacceptable delays would cause duplication of cost to the Government and harm the mission accomplishment, as they are critical to the customer. Any other software would cost the government the procurement price of new software, its maintenance cost, and considerable cost redoing all the work previously done with training Hotdocs software.  This action will result in a Firm Fixed Price contract.  <br>  <br> This Notice of Intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals. There will be no Request for Proposal available for competitive proposals. Phone calls WILL NOT be accepted. Interested parties may express their interest and provide a Capability Statement to the Contract Specialist via email at andrew.s.martin43.civ@mail.mil no later than 16 January 2013 at 10:30 am EST. A determination not to compete this proposed contract action upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command- NJ intends to solicit & award an acquisition for lodging and conference services in the Tampa, FL area. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to provide the requested services. The place of performance is within 15 miles from Tampa International airport. The period of performance for this effort is from 31 Jan 2013- 03 Feb 2013. The resultant contract is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price type contract. This acquisition is issued as a 100% Small Business Set Aside under the primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) of 721110 and the related small business size standard of $30 million.  <br> This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor and submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes. (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable). <br> This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for quote/proposal. Solicitation Number W911S1-13-T-0053 is assigned for reference purposes. The entire solicitation will be made available on or about 10 Jan 2013 via the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition to Business Website located at https://acquisition.army.mil.

It is the responsibility of the offeror to review the web page for notice of amendments, updates, or changes to the solicitation.  Please be advised that hard copies of the solicitation will not be made available; you must download solicitation documents from the ASFI.  All potential sources must obtain a DUNS number, a CAGE code, and register in the System for Award Management (SAM) located at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ in order to transact business with the government. Failure to obtain a DUNS number, a CAGE code and register in the SAM may result in the delay of award of a contract or possible award to the next otherwise successful offeror.

<DESC>// NSN(s): 4820-00-595-4263<br />// Item Description: Valve, Gate<br />// Manufacturer's Code and Part Number (if applicable): CAGE 79318 / P/N 114605<br />// Quantity (including option quantity): 25<br />// Unit of Issue: EA<br />// Destination Information: FOB Origin / I&amp;A Origin<br />// Delivery Schedule: 365 days
<p>The following numbered notes apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>12. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>26. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>(X) The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>(X) The solicitation will be available in DLA DIBBS (https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp) on its issue date of 01/28/2013.</p>
<p>(X) This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: CAGE 79318 / Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc.</p>
<p>(X) Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>(X) While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>(X) Various Increments Solicited:</p>
<p>FROM: 5 TO: 9<br />FROM: 10 TO: 24<br />FROM: 25 TO: 39<br />FROM: 40 TO: 50</p>
<p>(X) The Small Business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(X) TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: UNRESTRICTED</p>

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. (b) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the installation ombudsman, whose name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, and email address may be found at: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html     . Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at the installation may be referred to the Agency ombudsman identified at the above URL.

<DESC><em>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking a Contract to perform for a Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging Services. The purpose of this announcement is to provide a Presolicitation Notice for the release of Solicitation NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2013-010-DDC. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. </em>
<p>NHLBI has been developing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques and applying these methods to patients with acute presentations of ischemic heart disease. Many technical developments have been achieved in making cardiovascular MRI more feasible, specifically advances in how to acquire cine MRI, infarct images, T2 weighted images, and perfusion images have all been achieved over the past 8 years. In addition, substantial advances have been made in developing methods for quantifying myocardial perfusion at rest or during stress. Many of these advances have been made possible through image acceleration techniques related to parallel imaging methods. Three major breakthroughs consist of the following: <br />1) Fat water separated imaging: Developed imaging method for generating separate images of water and fat which is used for (a) imaging fibro&#8208;fatty infiltration, (b) improved tissue characterization and mass characterization, (c) reduced artifacts related to fat, (d) improved imaging of the pericardium and other thin walled structures in close proximity to fat.<br />2) Viability: Developed an improved free breathing motion corrected real&#8208;time late gadolinium enhancement protocol that may be used in patients with difficulty breath&#8208;holding and/or with arrhythmias.<br />3) Extra&#8208;cellular volume (ECV) fraction and T1&#8208;mapping: Developed parametric mapping of T1 and ECV that is useful in tissue characterization, and for the detection diffuse processes such as edema and fibrosis that are challenging to detect and characterize with conventional late gadolinium enhancement.</p>
<p>NHLBI is interested in focusing primarily in two areas: 1) advanced characterization of myocardial tissue and the relationship between these characteristics and disease processes; and 2) of exploring the role of quantitative MRI measures of myocardial perfusion at rest and during stress.</p>
<p>The contract will accomplish the following specific aims:<br />1. To improve the ability of MRI to differentiate acute and chronic myocardial infarction.<br />2. To develop more robust MRI methods to determine the ischemic myocardium at risk associated with acute myocardial infarction.<br />3. To characterize fat and water in myocardium and other tissue, particularly in specific cardiomyopathies.<br />4. To use T1 mapping to characterize the extracellular volume fraction and diffuse myocardial fibrosis in various cardiomyopathies.<br />5. To use MRI to predict which patients will respond better to specific interventions (e.g. valve replacement, transmyocardial laser therapy).</p>
<p><br />A Summary of Contract Requirements as follows:</p>
<p>1) Provide a dedicated cardiovascular MRI facility<br />2) The MRI facility needs to be within a facility with a cardiac catheterization laboratory and an echocardiography facility appropriate for acutely ill cardiovascular patients and patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery procedures.<br />3) Provide the facilities necessary to maintain the NHLBI cardiovascular MRI scanner.<br />4) Develop mechanisms to maintain access to greater than150 hospitalized patients per year and greater than150 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization within the constraints of applicable HIPPA/Privacy Act standards.<br />5) Provide MRI technologist support. Provide staffing appropriate to maintain the cardiac catheterization laboratory and echocardiography facility.<br />6) Provide nursing coverage adequate for monitoring acutely ill patients with cardiovascular disease coming from the emergency department or the Cardiac Care Unit. At least one of these nurses must be qualified at the level of a nurse research coordinator.<br />7) Provide Physician (Cardiology or Radiology Fellow). The physician shall be board certified or board eligible.<br />8) Provide support for medical records, archiving of medical images, and scheduling.<br />9) Provide supplies necessary for running a cardiovascular MRI facility (including but not limited to ECG gating supplies, MRI compatible intravenous injectors and supplies), a patient examination room, a cardiac catheterization laboratory (including but not limited to a bi-plane fluoroscopy unit, catheters, hemodynamic monitoring, intravenous injectors and supplies, quantitative coronary artery capability), and an echocardiography facility (including but not limited to three echocardiography machines, one of which allows transesophageal echo, echo probes, echo compatible intravenous contrast agents), intravenous tubing and associated supplies, scan room supplies, cleaning and miscellaneous supplies, laboratory and pathology services (including autopsies) and supplementary medical testing when indicated (such as x-rays to exclude MRI incompatible devices). <br />10) Provide translation services for those patients who require the service (both telephonic, as well as face-to-face interpretation)<br />11) Monthly meetings shall occur between contractor Staff and the NIH staff to assure contract compliance and protocol development.</p>
<p><br />This is not a request for proposal (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. <br />The RFP will be available on FedBizOpps Web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.
  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Agilent Technologies, Inc. to procure a demonstration model Agilent 5975C Series GC/MSD System with 7890A GC.  The Analytical Chemistry Research Core (ACRC) of the NHEERL Research Cores Unit requests that a 5975C Series GC/MSD system with 7890A GC be purchased from Agilent.  This instrument is required to enable continued ACRC support of RAP Task ACE 198, Project SEE-2.  Analytical methods and processes developed on the current equipment will be directly compatible with the Agilent 5975C Series GC/MSD system with 7890A GC, and thus will enable direct comparability of project data acquired on the two systems.
Therefore, EPA believes Agilent Technologies, Inc. is the only vendor capable of providing the demonstration model instrument needed by this project.  The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.302-1 ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements?.   All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation is available.  Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored.  The information received to this notice will be considered solely for  the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Sammie Jones (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 109 Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.  No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

VA is interested in acquiring a site on which it may construct a National Veteran Burial Ground in the Fargo, North Dakota, area.  VA is looking for a parcel of no less than three (3) acres.

Please note:

"	VA assumes no responsibility to purchase a site based upon responses to this advertisement. 

"	VA reserves the right to amend the delineated area and/or site requirements as needed.  

"	VA will only acquire a site based upon the fair market value, as determined by a qualified appraiser.

"	VA will not acquire a site that is within the 100 year flood plain, unless it has no practicable alternative.

If you would like to offer a site for VA's consideration, please submit an expression of interest to the Point of Contact listed below.

State whether you have title to property, the site is under contract, whether you have retained an option to purchase, or have any other type of interest in the property. 

You are encouraged to submit additional information on the offered site, including, but not limited to, the following items.  

Optional Items:

1.	Legal description of site and maps, surveys, site plan, photographs, or renderings.
2.	Map showing access to site from major transportation routes, public transportation, and distance from nearest existing cemetery. 
3.	Availability of utilities, including water, sewer, gas, and electric.  Provide a site plan that includes location of utilities, any easements (above and below ground), adjacent roads, and/or other encumbrances affecting the potential development of the parcel.  Include any grading, drainage or sewer plans that have been or will be completed in the future.
4.	Previously identified environmental, historic, or cultural resources issues known to exist on the site and any remediation efforts taken or to be taken.  Provide copies of any environmental studies or assessments that have been conducted.
5.	Proof that the site is outside the 100 year flood zone, shown on a flood map or wetland survey.
6.	Information on any ongoing or planned development affecting the site, including neighboring projects and road/public utility line construction.

<p>Microsoft Premier Support Services</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.0 Scope</p>
<p>Through the Microsoft Premier Support Services contract, the vendor shall provide technical issue resolution, operational consulting services oriented on optimization of designs and project plans, periodic and on-demand evaluation of production deployments with regard to optimal operation and supportability, 24x7x365 availability of engineering staff when mission critical systems are affected, and dedicated cleared on-site resources responsible for managing all technical support services provided under the contract. The vendor shall also provide opportunities for on-site skills transfer from cleared resources, training and workshops designed to enhance the skills of NASIC technical support staff, remote staff resourcing when requested by NASIC, recommendations for technical services and regular reporting of contract consumption.</p>
<p>2.0 Requirements</p>
<p>The Services include the following as specified in the contract line item numbers (CLIN) listed within the delivery order:<br />2.1 Support Account Management from an assigned Contractor resource ("Services Resource") helps to build and maintain relationships with Government management and service delivery staff and helps the Government arrange each element of Premier Support to meet Government business requirements.</p>
<p>2.2 Program Manager support is provided by a cleared, designated, Contractor resource working with customer leadership. The Program Manager is responsible for overall delivery of Contractor Services within the customer organization and may travel to other local sites as needed based on operational and service delivery and management requirements. Program Manager drives overall quality assurance, staffing coordination, and a single contact point for all Contractor Services delivery across the customer organization(s).</p>
<p>2.3 Workshops help the Government to prevent problems, increase system availability and assist with creating products and solutions based on Microsoft technologies.</p>
<p>2.4 Problem Resolution Support provides assistance for problems with specific symptoms encountered while using Microsoft products, where there is a reasonable expectation that the problem is caused by Microsoft products.</p>
<p>2.5 Support Assistance provides short-term advice and guidance for problems not covered with Problem Resolution Service as well as requests for consultative assistance for design, development and deployment issues.<br />2.6 Information Services provide Government staff with the latest knowledge on Microsoft technologies to enhance Government in-house support capabilities.</p>
<p>2.7 The Government may utilize any combination of the following Services. <br />2.7.1 Support Account Management. Support Account Management services are intended to help coordinate the support and services relationship. The Services Resource (aka Technical Account Manager or "TAM") is the Government's advocate within Microsoft and facilitates a team that can provide Workshops, Problem Resolution Support, and Support Assistance. The Services Resource also serves as the point of information delivery and provides Government feedback regarding the Services to other Microsoft groups. The Services Resource can also provide the following services which may be deducted from the pre-paid hours listed in the delivery order:<br />2.7.1.1 Planning and Resource Facilitation. At the commencement of each individual delivery order, an orientation and planning session can be conducted with Government management and staff via teleconference or onsite if an onsite visit has been purchased. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the Services available, gather input regarding Government support needs, and jointly plan Government use of the Services. <br />2.7.1.2 Status Meetings and Reporting. A status report shall be prepared on a regular basis, to summarize the Services delivered during the previous reporting period. Status meetings will be conducted to discuss Service activities, monitor Government satisfaction levels, and discuss actions or adjustments that may be required. Customized reporting can be provided at Government request and any additional related labor will be deducted from Government purchased Support Assistance hours as detailed in the delivery order.<br />2.7.1.3 Escalation Management. Support issues that require escalation to other resources within Microsoft can be closely managed by the Services Resource to expedite resolution.<br />2.7.1.4 Service Delivery Plan. The Service Delivery Plan will represent a roadmap for using Support services during the year. Components of the plan may include high-level objectives, overview of major projects, key satisfaction drivers, resource requirements and a schedule of planned activities.<br />2.7.2. Workshops. The goal of Workshops is to provide the Government proactive technical information to assist in the design, development or deployment of Microsoft technologies. Additional benefits may include instruction to help reduce the number and minimize the impact of problems related to Microsoft Products that the Government experiences. <br />Contractor shall conduct instructor-led training sessions that emphasize Microsoft technologies at a Government facility or on location at Contractor's facility. If the Government elects to have a Workshop conducted at a Government facility, Contractor will provide the Government with specifications for configuring the Government's environment prior to the delivery of the Workshops. Workshops are individually scoped and priced depending upon the length, delivery location and material presented. The Services Resource can provide the Government with a current list of available Workshops.<br />2.7.3 Problem Resolution Support. Problem Resolution Support provides assistance for problems with specific symptoms encountered while using Microsoft products, where there is a reasonable expectation that the problems are caused by Microsoft products. Problem Resolution Support is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Requests for support may be submitted via telephone or electronically through the Premier online website by the Government's designated contacts, except for Severity 1 and A which must be submitted via telephone. <br />2.7.3.1 Problem Request (Break-Fix). An assisted break-fix support request, also known as an incident, is defined as a single support issue and the reasonable effort needed to resolve it. A single support issue is a problem that cannot be broken down into subordinate issues. If a problem consists of subordinate issues, each shall be considered a separate incident. Incidents requiring an onsite visit will be charged on an hourly basis and will include charges for reasonable travel and living expenses. In certain situations, Contractor may provide the Government with a modification to the commercially available Microsoft product software code to address specific critical problems ("Hotfix(es)") in response to an assisted break-fix support request. Hotfixes are designed to address the Government's specific problems and are not regression tested. Except as otherwise provided herein or in an amendment or modification to the delivery order, Hotfixes may not be distributed to unaffiliated third parties without Microsoft's express written consent. <br />2.7.3.2. US National Problem Resolution Support. To maintain a strong focus on national security, and when the Contractor has an explicit contractual obligation to provide US citizen (only) support for the first technical support contact, the Government's interaction with Microsoft's non-escalation technical support engineers will be limited to US citizens for "break/fix" reactive support issues involving the following products: Windows, Exchange Server, SQL Server, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), System Center Configuration Manager, System Center Operations Manager, System Center Mobile Device Manager, System Center Essentials, System Center Virtual Machine Manager, System Center Online Asset Inventory Services (AIS), System Center Capacity Planner, System Center Desktop Error Monitoring, System Center Data Protection Manager, System Center Service Manager, WSUS 3.0, Application Virtualization (App-V), Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization (Med-V), and Microsoft Office SharePoint (not including Designer and Developer support for SharePoint). Additional products available for US Nat PRS support may be included via a mutually agreed upon amendment or modification as support becomes available. Products otherwise supported by Microsoft Services Premier Support but not available for support under the US Nat PRS program will be supported by Microsoft's traditional Problem Resolution Support channels.<br />The Contractor has no obligation to provide a US citizen beyond the first technical support contact. If a case requires support beyond the first technical support professional, the Contractor cannot guarantee that the escalation support professional will be a US citizen.<br />A dedicated US Nat PRS toll free number will be provided to the customer contact(s) designated by the Government along with the necessary account number and account ID's. The dedicated US Nat PRS toll free number allows Microsoft to expedite US citizen support and further differentiate the US Nat PRS service experience allowing for even more assurance the cases will be routed accurately. The Government understands and agrees that the dedicated US Nat PRS toll free number must be used in order to gain the benefit of the US Nat PRS program.<br />2.7.4 Support Assistance. Support Assistance provides short-term advice and guidance for problems not covered with Problem Resolution Support as well as requests for assistance for design, development and deployment issues. The Services Resource will work with the Government to determine the Government's specific Support Assistance needs. The following are types of Support Assistance that can be utilized under this proposal: <br />2.7.4.1 Infrastructure Support Assistance. Infrastructure Support Assistance includes informal advice, guidance and knowledge transfer intended to help the Government implement Microsoft technologies in ways that avoid common support issues and decrease the likelihood of system outages. <br />These services also help the Government to resolve problems that are not attributed to Microsoft Products including:<br />2.7.4.1.1 Errors caused by the Government's networking infrastructure, hardware, non-Microsoft software, operational procedures, architecture, IT service management process, system configuration or human error.<br />2.7.4.1.2 Multi-vendor coordination interoperability problems. Upon the Government's request, Contractor will collaborate with third-party software suppliers to help resolve complex multi-vendor product interoperability issues.<br />2.7.4.2 Reviews. A review is an assessment of a specific system, application or architecture to address design, development, deployment, and supportability issues for current or planned implementations of Microsoft technologies. Each review is individually scoped and estimated prior to scheduling resources, and a written report is produced to document findings and recommendations. All requests for reviews and the applicable data must be submitted to Contractor no later than 60 days prior to the Expiration Date.<br />2.7.4.3 Development Support Assistance. Development Support Assistance helps the Government in the creation and development of internal applications on the Microsoft platform that integrate Microsoft technologies. Development Support Assistance specializes in Microsoft development tools and technologies.<br />2.7.4.4 Lab Access. Contractor can provide the Government with access to a lab facility to assist with product development, benchmarking and testing, prototyping and migration activities on Microsoft products. These facilities must be scheduled in advance and are subject to availability.<br />2.7.5 Information Services. Information Services provide the Government with technical information about Microsoft products and support tools that help to implement and operate Microsoft products in a more efficient and effective manner. Information Services can include any combination of the following:<br />2.7.5.1 Premier Online Website. The Premier online website is Microsoft confidential information provided to only those customers who have an active Premier Support Agreement. The Premier online website provides access to the following information resources at no additional charge:<br />2.7.5.1.1 Regularly updated product news flashes documenting key support and operational information about Microsoft products.<br />2.7.5.1.2 Critical problem alerts notifying the Government of potentially high-impact problems.<br />2.7.5.1.3 Web response tool for submitting and checking the status of support incidents.<br />2.7.5.1.4 Microsoft Knowledge Base of technical articles and troubleshooting tools and guides.<br />2.7.5.1.5 Troubleshooting Information for your Microsoft Products. Access to Microsoft knowledge base of technical support articles. Troubleshooting tools and diagnostic guides and up-to-date information white papers and best practices.<br />2.7.5.2 Support Webcasts. Support webcasts are regularly scheduled webcast discussions led by Contractor program managers, developers and professionals covering key areas of Microsoft technology. These are provided at no additional charge and require high speed internet access to participate.<br />2.7.6 Designated Support Professional Services. A Designated Support Professional (also known as Dedicated Support Engineer) will manage the Government's problem requests that are submitted to the Designated Support Team. Designated Support Professionals are specialists in their product areas and provide Services during normal business hours. Designated Support Professionals can be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when support escalations or planned deployments are pre-arranged. Problem requests submitted to this team may require resources from standard product support professionals for resolution, although the Designated Support Professional retains responsibility for the request. Problem requests may be opened using the standard product support process as described in this proposal depending on the availability of Designated Support Professionals and the severity of the issue. Designated Support Professional hours are deducted from the total number of Designated Support hours as set forth in the delivery order. When Designated Support Professionals from the Designated Support Team are not available, backup designated support professionals will be made available.</p>

<DESC>Description:  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager, Maneuver Ammunition Systems (PM-MAS), is seeking possible sources to develop, test, qualify and produce high and low velocity grenade 40mm Target Practice Day/ Night/ Thermal (TP-D/N/T) training cartridges.   <br>  <br> The desired training cartridges employ a projectile which provides an impact signature that is visible day and night by the unaided eye and through night-vision and thermal/infra-red weapon sights and which does not include energetics or other features which may generate an unexploded ordnance hazard.  HV 40mm TP-D/N/T training cartridge will be interoperable and fired from the Mk19 Mod 3 Grenade Machine Gun.  LV 40mm TP-D/N/T training cartridge will be interoperable and fired from M203 and M320 grenade launchers. The desired training cartridges propulsion system will be insensitive to environmental effects. Offerors are expected to provide an estimated Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) along with substantiating design, analysis, testing and manufacturing data to support the TRL/ MRL claim. Offerors are free to discuss how the low velocity concepts would be different from or similar to high velocity concepts.  <br>  <br> Specifications:    <br> Draft versions of the performance specifications for the 40mm HV &LV TP-D/N/T Training Cartridges will be available upon request. The performance specification details the signature requirements with respect to duration, range and visibility.  To request the performance specification, the requestor must be a DoD contractor and registered in an active status in the Defense Logistics Information Service, U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (See www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for instructions and information).  Offerors should submit their certification via DD Form 2345 or register immediately.  An offeror's delay in doing so will not be a basis to extend the closing date of this market survey.  The performance specification has been labeled Distribution Statement F: Further dissemination only as directed by SFAE-AMO-MAS, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ,07806-5000, or higher DoD authority.  Reproduction requires approval of originator, SFAE-AMO-MAS, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, 07806- 5000 or higher DoD authority.  The performance specifications are controlled by international traffic in arms regulations, foreign sources must submit an export license request.  Interested companies will be required to return/destroy the performance specification when requested by the Government.  Offerors are free to discuss how the low velocity concepts would be different from or similar to high velocity concepts.  If and when a solicitation is released detailed information regarding which sights will be utilized to evaluate the bid samples will be released.  <br>  <br> Planned Acquisition:   <br> The Government envisions releasing an RFP in the third quarter FY13 and conducting a bid sample test in the fourth quarter FY13 timeframe. Multiple awards for Engineering and Manufacturing Development are anticipated for the second quarter FY14 timeframe with a possible down select to occur prior to low rate initial production, which would begin approximately at the end of FY15.  Any resulting contract may contain up to three options for production. Load, assemble and pack, propellant, cartridge case components, and projectile bodies may be restricted to the national technology and industrial base for production. The contract type will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP).  The primary outcomes sought under this effort will be the qualification of training cartridges and obtaining Government Purpose rights to the technical data for the cartridges.  The Government intends to use the technical data package as a basis for future full and open procurements.  The Government requests that Offerors submit information regarding data rights and Offeror requirements for the Government to obtain those rights. <br>  <br> Submission Information:   <br> THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION.  Please be advised that the Government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement.  Interested companies should submit their qualifications and capabilities electronically within 30 days of this notice to: US Army Contracting Command- New Jersey, ACC-NJ-MA, Brad Borek Bldg 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 or by email to: bradley.r.borek.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>Solicitation Number:  <br> W913FT-13-R-0007  <br> Notice Type:  <br> Sources Sought  <br> Synopsis:  <br>  <br> Description:  Vehicle Maintenance Annex Building Construction Sources Sought Notice. <br>  <br> I. Sources Sought Synopsis: This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of a solicitation. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSAL AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  <br>  <br> a) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to construct a vehicle maintenance annex, which will be interconnected to a currently ongoing supply building contract. Both construction projects will eventually be incorporated as one multi-use logistics complex.  <br> b) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS. <br> c) Although  quote mark proposal quote mark  and  quote mark offeror quote mark  are used in this Sources Sought Synopsis, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  <br>  <br> d) Background:   The contract W913FT-12-C-0021 was awarded on 24 September, 2012 to construct a supply warehouse for the U.S. Army Logistics Mission (LOGMIS) in Bogota, Colombia. Construction for the warehouse began immediately upon contract award.  The requirement for solicitation W913FT-13-R-0007 is to construct a Vehicle Maintenance Facility in a corresponding site area where it will eventually be combined with the Supply Warehouse to create one multi-use logistics complex.  The infrastructure for both buildings shall contain the same materials, and have an identical likeness to properly convey the image that both buildings are clearly part of the same complex. <br>  <br> II. Requirements: The offeror must have the ability to purchase the materials and create specifications that will match those being used on contract W913FT-12-C-0021, in order to construct a facility that will be equal in likeness to the Supply Building being currently built, and the rest of the logistics multi-use complex.    <br> e) Unless there are viable respondents to this SSS that can meet the requirements specified herein, the United States Military Group Contracting Office anticipates award of a sole source contract to Constructora Condiseno, Bogota Colombia by approximately 1 April, 2013 to fulfill this requirement. Constructora Condiseno is the current contractor on constructing the Supply Warehouse in contract W913FT-12-C-0021.   <br> This construction shall be accomplished using the specifications already in place on contract W913FT-12-C-0021, to include drawings or design descriptions and materials that meet the need for the Government to have the same appearance on every building in the complex.  This will be the last building constructed as part of the U.S. Army Logistics Mission logistics multi-use area. <br> III. In response to this SSS, please provide the following information: <br> Part I: Business Information: <br> Please provide the following business information for your company and for any teaming or joint venture partners: <br>   Company Name:  <br>   Address:  <br>   Point of Contact:  <br>   CAGE Code:  <br>   Phone Number:  <br>   E-mail Address:  <br>  <br> North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code: 236220 - Commercial and Institutional Building Construction <br> Part II: Capabilities:  <br>  <br> a) Describe your company's past and current experience in providing construction services in projects of this magnitude. <br> b) Describe your cost-effective approach to finish the project under the parameters listed in section I above.   <br> c) Describe your company's previous experience of utilizing and matching materials and designs, to those that already exist.  In your approach, demonstrate your ability to mitigate this issue without the support of the current contractor.  <br> d) Are there any other relevant topics, concerns, and information that will help the Government in forming an acquisition strategy? <br> g) Please e-mail your responses to the Contracting Officer at Michael.haydo@tcsc.southcom.mil  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<p>DLA Troop Support (Troop Support), Construction &amp; Equipment is conducting market research on the above items to determine an acquisition strategy that will enhance worldwide military customers support as well as to determine your industry capability for providing these required items. Therefore, Troop Support would appreciate your firm sharing your expertise and insight into how these items can be most efficiently procured.</p>
<p>Troop Support anticipates issuing a solicitation for the referenced items under an Indefinite Quantity Contract. The contract will be for two (2) base years. Further, it may contain an option to extend the term of the contract. If an option to extend the term of the contract provision is included in the solicitation, each option term would be for one year. However, the total contract term will not exceed five years. The answer to the questions concerning pricing will be one of the factors that will help the Government to determine the term of the contract.</p>

No information provided in response to this inquiry will be considered binding between the vendor and the Government. With these facts in mind, it is requested that you review the items listed above and answer the questions on the attached pages. The answers you provide will remain confidential. Please return this survey to Pamela Tull, by January 14, 2013 by email at Pamela.Tull@dla.mil.</p>

<DESC>(1) PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE AND REQUEST: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is hereby soliciting broad information to identify, improve and/or enhance approaches that will establish an external facility on the International Space Station (ISS) for testing and demonstrating performance, reliability, and durability of spacecraft materials, devices, and subsystems in the low Earth orbit (LEO) space environment. This facility builds on a long history of NASA activities to provide natural space environmental exposure testing that dates back to the Mir Environmental Effects Payload (MEEP) experiment in 1996. MEEP involved a four-part experiment each deployed separately, but using a common carrier design referred to as a Passive Experiment Container (PEC) or suitcase. The Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) series of deployments built on the successful MEEP concept. From 2001 through the present, there have been six MISSE missions launched on the Space Shuttle with 10 PECs and one smaller tray deployed on ISS using extra-vehicular activity (EVA). The LEO exposure durations for these MISSE missions ranged from 1 to 4 years. To date, over 4,000 samples from approximately 80 organizations including NASA, Department of Defense, industry and academia have flown on MISSE with very high payoff. With the retirement of the Shuttle and the requirement to minimize EVA on ISS and the use of extravehicular robotics (EVR) for all routine operations, continuation of a MISSE-type capability requires development, deployment, and operation of a new facility designed for this operational environment and the associated drivers and constraints. Towards this end, NASA is seeking broad information on approaches for achieving this next generation facility capability in five primary areas: (1) Development - Designing, building, and installing an external environment exposure facility on ISS at the ExPRESS Logistics Carrier (ELC), site 3 location; (2) Operations Management - Operations of this facility capability including facility command & data handling operations, management of initial and re-supply launch/return services, cost models to support operations, etc.; (3) Research Management - Solicitation and manifesting of experiments, data retrieval and dissemination; cost models to support research, etc; (4) Engineering Management  Ground based integration & test services for installing experiments on the facility, support safety & design reviews; cost models to support engineering, etc; (5) Sustaining Management - Maintenance of the facility capability including service/repair and upgrades/enhancements of the facility, cost models to support sustainment, etc. (2) TYPICAL SPECIFICATIONS: It is the intent of this RFI to solicit a broad range of concepts and approaches that are not overly constrained by hard requirements. Consequently, only a very limited set of requirements is specified; this is augmented by guidelines that are not requirements but that may be useful in developing the responses. The following capability characteristics are provided as requirements: (1) The facility shall be externally mounted on ISS on an EXPRESS Logistics Carrier (ExPA) and be compatible with associated ISS interface requirements such as payload envelope, mass, center-of-gravity, power, etc. (2) The facility shall be installed, operated and maintained using EVR with no nominal requirement for EVA. (Note: Must accommodate design for EVA to support ISS contingency operations only.) (3) The facility shall accommodate active (power and commanding) and passive experiments. (4) The facility shall allow experiment exposure in at least the ram, wake, and zenith directions relative to the ISS coordinate system. (5) The facility shall allow for the return to Earth of exposed experiments. (Note: Not all experiments require return and experiments may be grouped in containers to minimize operations). The following capability characteristics are provided as guidelines: (1) Experiment exposure duration of 1 to 3 years. (2) Maximize experiment surface exposure area while minimizing cross-contamination. (3) On-orbit maintenance-free operational life of at least 3 years. (4) On-orbit serviceable life of at least 10 years. (5) Facility modular block upgrade path for enhanced capabilities and services. Other capabilities that may be considered include but are not limited to: (1) Environmental monitoring such as measurements of atomic oxygen, solar ultraviolet radiation, total ionizing dose, temperature, etc. (2) Telemetry, archival and dissemination of on-orbit facility and experiment data. (3) Obtaining high-resolution visual images of exposed experiment surfaces. (4) Removal and replacement of experiment containers While it is highly desirable to have capabilities to maximize science and technology return, this must be appropriately balanced against cost and complexity. In this case, complexity involves two primary elements: (1) Design complexity in which it is highly desirable to have a design that is simple and inherently robust, that has low likelihood of failures, and that requires minimum maintenance; (2) Installation/operations/sustaining complexity where major considerations include compatibility with EVR operations, minimum frequency of EVR and Intravehicular Activity (IVA) operations, and minimum use of the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) airlock. (3) RESPONSE REQUESTED: NASA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources. The responses should address: (1) Concepts, plans, and/or business models for any or all of the five primary areas (Development, Operations Management, Research Management, Engineering Management, and Sustaining Management) described above; (2) Organizational capabilities and experiences that are relevant to these areas; (3) Rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate to provide all capabilities described/discussed for each primary area addressed; and (4) High level schedule for each primary area addressed above. (4) RESPONSE DATE: Responses are requested by January 31, 2013. Information received after this date will only be considered if deemed in the Governments best interest. Please reference this RFI in your response. Respondents are cautioned to suitably mark any information that it considers proprietary. All electronic responses should be sent to the RFI POCs, identified below. (5) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The purpose of this RFI is to solicit broad information to identify, improve and/or enhance approaches that will establish an external facility on the ISS for testing and demonstrating performance, reliability, and durability of spacecraft materials, devices, and subsystems in the LEO space environment.  Additional information, if forthcoming, will be synopsized in the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) and FedBizOps. It is the responsibility of potential users to monitor NAIS for the release of any additional information or synopsis. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for any information solicited. Since this is an RFI, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. (6) POINTS OF CONTACT: Responses should be emailed to larc-misse-x-cmrd1@mail.nasa.gov and reference this RFI Solicitation No. in the email subject line.  Questions should be emailed to larc-misse-x-cmrd1@mail.nasa.gov with the respective Point of Contact in the email subject line. The Points of Contact are as follows: Stuart Cooke, MISSE-X Project Manager or Randy Lillard, Program Executive for Technology Demonstration Missions.

<DESC>This announcement is specific to a Request for Information (RFI) and does not constitute a solicitation; nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. This is not a request for proposals, quotations, or bids. Any information submitted is voluntary and should only pertain to the purpose of this RFI. Responding to this RFI is not a requirement to be an eligible offeror on any future Request for Proposal (RFP) related to this work.<br /><br />NGA is seeking contractor support to establish a spatial interface research laboratory within existing InnoVision laboratory spaces at NCE by leveraging commercially-available technology platforms consisting of spatial and gestural interface hardware and/or software at technology readiness level of 9. One of the goals of the lab will be to integrate and field leading-edge, game-changing technology with a special emphasis on human-computer interface (HCI) systems. InnoVision research activities will specifically explore how to systematically test and evaluate HCI systems and technology platforms, and mitigate the risk to NGA for integration. This request for information (RFI) would assist NGA staff scientists in identifying innovative commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) HCIs to support advanced visualization and higher-order analysis of geospatial and intelligence data.<br /><br />Ideally, the system and /or platform(s) would be able to exist within NGA/InnoVisions' existing confines; 20 feet by 35 feet and current hardware configuration. InnoVision would use the in house 55 inch screens (three) with 1920x1980,60Hz progressive native input. NGA will also use a whiteboard capture camera or similar device for gestural tracking. Information on those platforms that can integrate with these devices would be appreciated. <br /><br />The technology platform(s) within the InnoVision's Spatial Interface Lab would enable applications to run across multiple screens and diverse computing devices, and allow multiple users to simultaneously interact with pixels/data on every device. This in turn would allow analysis and collaboration from one user to multiple users, within the space and with those connected to the platform outside of the lab space. A thorough understanding of security requirements, installation of these types of technology platforms in SCIF's and general knowledge of integration into Intelligence Community (IC) networks is highly desirable. Please note that Apple solutions will not be entertained because of incompatibility with existing infrastructure.<br /><br />In summary, NGA/InnoVision requests information on innovative spatial interfaces and technology platforms that have special emphasis on HCIs that can exploit data/pixels in a unified multi-screen, multi-device environment for scientific research, educational, and collaborative purposes. Finally, this platform would enable the InnoVision researcher and analyst to pursue interactive big data exploration, hypothesis generation, and finding cause-and-effect relationships. <br /><br />How to Respond: <br />Prospective sources that have the ability to satisfy the requirements of this potential procurement are requested to submit a statement of pertinent capabilities and experience. Responses to this RFI MUST BE submitted/received by the Due Date-Time and Method for submittal specified below without exception.<br />Due Date-Time: All responses to the RFI MUST BE received by no later than 31 January 2013<br /><br />Method for Submittal: <br />Please either e-mail or mail your reply to the following point of contact: Rose Schultz, NGA, Mail Stop S84 7500 GEOINT Drive, Springfield, VA 22150. E-mail: rose.m.schultz@nga.mil <br /><br />To aid in Government review, the total pages for the entire submission are limited to not more than 10 pages. The first page of the submission must state the RFI title and provide the name, e-mail address and telephone number for an individual that can be contacted for clarification or questions regarding this submission. The first page should also provide a short description of the company to include capabilities, company size and category (e.g., large, small, small disadvantaged). Each 10 page submission shall include responses to the areas of interest outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW) and respond to the questions below. The response format is 8.5" X 11", 12 pt. Times New Roman font, single spaced, with 1" margins on all sides. <br />Responses shall not include proprietary information. Any responses that are marked proprietary will not be considered. No marketing materials will be accepted.<br /><br />In addition to your capabilities statement, please address the following general questions:<br />1. What type of business are you?<br />2. Small business size status under NAIC code 541519. <br />3. Do you have the capability of providing/implementing a spatial interface research lab?<br />4. Can you perform all required work?<br />5.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP). THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

This is a market research tool to determine whether to set-aside an acquisition for services for Small Business (SB) only prior to issuing the RFP.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic (NAVFAC), implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  An award will not be made on offers received in response to this notice.  The Government is not responsible for the cost associated with any effort expended in responding to this notice.
  Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Synopsis, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Governments best interest.

The acquisition is for a professional services Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, which may include advisory and assistance services under the Public Private Venture (PPV) Housing Program.  The DoN selects highly qualified business partners to construct, renovate, maintain, and operate family housing for military service members and their families.  The DoN and the selected private sector partners establish long-term business relationships.  The DoN leases the land and conveys existing housing assets to the partner.
  The partner develops and manages the property as a private housing community targeted to serve military service members through preferred referral.  The partner earns fees for services and a return on equity.  By leveraging private sector debt, developer equity and DoN monetary contributions to fund the initial construction, the DoN and private partner quickly construct, replace and renovate the housing inventory.  Rental payments from tenant leases provide the on-going source of income for the projects.  The DoN maintains a portfolio and asset management process to monitor the status of each project, and assess trends, risks, and opportunities in the privatized portfolio.  As of June 2012, the DoN Special Venture Acquisition department has executed 36 partnership agreements that include Navy and Marine Corps installations across the United States, with an end state of more than 62,000 homes, including 2 unaccompanied housing privatization pilot projects.
  Additional family and unaccompanied housing PPV projects, Enhanced Use Lease, Energy Support, and other Special Ventures projects will be pursued.
Projects and/or task will include, but are not limited to: large scale real estate portfolio management, provide advice and assistance and conduct the necessary research and analysis to DoN decision-makers with accurate and relevant information; contractor bringing practices from the private sector to assist, including family and unaccompanied housing public private ventures knowledge; enhanced use leasing, energy support and other public-private venture opportunities such as lodging.  

Work includes professional services, project development, execution, portfolio management advice and support consistent with the privatization approach adopted by the DoN.
  Contractor must assist with all aspects of determining project feasibility, concept development and deal negotiation including interaction with third party entities such as property managers, asset managers, developers and financial institutions.  Assist with the design, implementation, appropriate expansion and continuous improvement of portfolio management tools and methodologies to oversee and monitor the performance and condition of the DoNs portfolio of privatized facilities.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  This notice does NOT constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid.  The intent of this notice is to identify potential Offerors for market research purposes.  TELEPHONIC SUBMISSION AND QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE ENTERTAINED AS THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest (NAVFAC NW) is specifically seeking businesses with current, relevant qualifications, experience, personnel, and capabilities to perform the proposed requirement.

The requirement includes one (1) bid item as follows:

Bid Item 0001:  Disposal and recycling materials being received will consist of approximately 4,000 tons/year of Industrial Wood Waste, 2,000 tons/year of Food and Compostable Waste, and 120 tons/year of Contaminated Waste.
  The successful source would receive a firm fixed price contract for one base year and two option years.

Source will demonstrate compliance with environmental regulations, including air pollution control permit; storm water discharge/control permit; county health permit; state Department of Ecology permits to operate a certified food and organics composting facility. 

Summary of Permits required by offer or to handle and compost Navy material: 

	1.  Department of Ecology Storm Water Permit 

	2.  Air Pollution Control Authority Permit 

	3.  County Health Department Solid Waste Handling Permit 

	4.  County Health Department Contaminated Materials Permit 

	5.  County Health Department Composting permits for Types I, II and III material.

Source must certify that their work processes exclude banned material from incoming material stream and that their inspections process is followed for all incoming material.
  Excluded materials include pressure treated lumber, asbestos bearing material, hazardous material, and hazardous wastes.

Chain of custody/quality control for industrial wood waste.  The Navy industrial wood waste stream contains approximately  2,000 tons per year (included in the previously stated 4,000 tons) of fire retardant coated wood blocking from dry-dock operations.  This material is not hazardous waste, but it does impact the pollution control equipment of the facilities that purchase wood chips for use as fuel.  Offeror will provide verification that their wood sorting and process control procedures to verify that their facility can properly handle and market this material.

Marine growth and food waste composting:  Navy material will include marine growth arising from cleaning spill and security containment booms.

Food waste and other compostable material such as soiled packaging, paper hand towels, soiled facial tissues, and various contaminated paper products are components of this waste stream.
  The source will verify that their composting process meets or exceeds the EPA standard for the process to further reduce pathogens (PFRP).  PFRP requires a minimum holding time of 72 hours at 132 degrees F or higher.  The method of verification of PFRP attainment is a visual inspection of the operations logs identifying each batch and the temperature readings at least twice daily of the material.  Each batch of material should have a minimum of 6 readings with different times. 

Co-mingling of bio solid compost and regular compost:  If the Offerers facility processes bio solids, the Offer shall demonstrate documentation that composted bio solids are kept separately from non bio solids and that there are processes in place that prevent cross contamination of material handling and processing equipment.

Naval Base Kitsap (NBK) is comprised of Naval Magazine Indian Island, Keyport, Bangor, Jackson Park, and Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.
  

Source understands that some of the Navy-generated industrial wood waste will have undetectable, large metal fasteners, which have been proven to cause significant damage to commercial shredding and chipping machines.  Contractors should understand the Navy is not liable for damage caused to equipment by Navy material.

Contaminated Materials truck waste, street sweeping debris:  A portion of Navy solid waste amounting to roughly 120 tons per year is generated from maintaining streets and cleaning storm drains.  This material may have high concentrations of sand, petroleum, and minor quantities of other contaminants.  The source will provide verification that they have the proper permits to compost this material.
 

The estimated magnitude of work for this project is $720,000.

FAR 13.106(B)
This is a notice of intent of the Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 10701 East Blvd., Cleveland, Ohio  44106 to negotiate sole source with Fresenius USA, Inc. for supplying The Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, with:

24 EA 190713 			Hemodialysis Machine-Fresenius 2008T
With:  CDX (Clinical Data Exchange) System; (CLM) Crit-Line II Monitor; and Crit-Line Pole Mount

The Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center Pilot Hemodialysis Center is opening a 24 station Hemodialysis Center in the local community to provide Hemodialysis to our veteran patients.  We are requesting 24 Hemodialysis  Delivery Machines to be used within this center for patient care.

Hemodialysis machines are designed to provide Hemodialysis treatment by controlling and monitoring both the dialysate and extracorporeal blood circuits.  In the extracorporeal blood circuit, the blood is continuously circulated from the patient through the dialyzer, where toxins are filtered out through a semi-permeable membrane, before being returned to the patient.  During this process, the extracorporeal blood circuit is monitored for venous and arterial blood pressures and for the presence of air and blood.  These machines can also administer Heparin evenly throughout the treatment.  In the dialysate circuit the dialysate concentrates are mixed with purified water, heated, degassed and delivered to the dialyzer.  Balancing chambers within the machine ensure that the incoming flow of the dialysate is volumetrically equal to the outgoing flow in order to control ultra filtration from the patient.

The Government believes that only one business can satisfy the agency requirements and intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b) - access to proprietary information. Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by Wednesday January 23, 2013 at 5PM EST. Such capabilities information will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No solicitation is available at this time.    All inquiries must be submitted by email to Rachelle Hamer at rachelle.hamer@va.gov.

<DESC>1.	NOTICE OF INTENT:  The U.S. Army Engineering Support Center, Huntsville, Alabama (CEHNC) intends to award a requirement to service disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB) DAI Management Consultant in the estimated amount of $65,000.  (THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION. The Government is only performing market research in order to determine if there are any other SDVOSB firms that possess the capability to execute the requirement noted below (estimated award date of  January   2013). This notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  <br>  <br> 2.. Scope/Description of Requirement:   <br> In support of the Energy Initiatives Task Force (EITF), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (USAESCH)), proposes to acquire market analysis and forecasting services to facilitate the evaluation of the economic and regulatory feasibility of renewable energy development at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri (FLW), and Redstone Arsenal, Alabama (RSA).  The analysis will include the following elements: <br>  <br>  	Projection of electric power prices; <br>  	Projection of natural gas prices; <br>  	Projection of relevant Renewable Energy Credit prices; <br>  	Identification of relevant industry/regulatory considerations that may bear on the determination of the desirability of renewable energy development at FLW and RSA; and,  <br>  	Assessment of utility's projected load and analysis of the basis for the utility's projections. <br>  <br> 3.	Under 13 C.F.R. 125.9 and 125.10, to be an eligible SDVOSB, <br>  <br>  <br> (a)	A concern must be at least 51% unconditionally and directly owned by one or more service-disabled veterans. <br> NOTE: Ownership by one or more service disabled veterans must be direct ownership. In the case of a concern which is a corporation, at least 51% of the aggregate of all stock outstanding and at least 51% of each class of voting stock outstanding must be unconditionally owned by one or more service-disabled veterans. <br>  <br> (b)	the management and daily business operations of the concern must be controlled by one or more service-disabled veterans (or in the case of a veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such veteran). Control by one or more service-disabled veterans means that both the long-term decisions making and the day-to-day management and administration of the business operations must be conducted by one or more service-disabled veterans (or in the case of a veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such veteran). <br>  <br> (c)	 One or more service-disabled veterans (or in the case of a veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such veteran) must control the Board of Directors of the concern. Service-disabled veterans are considered to control the Board of Directors when either: <br>  <br>  <br> (i) One of more service-disabled veterans own at least 51% of all voting stock of the concern, are on the Board of Directors and have the percentage of voting stock necessary to overcome any super majority voting requirements; or <br>  <br>  <br> (ii) Service-disabled veterans comprise the majority of voting directors through actual numbers or, where permitted by state law, through weighted voting. <br>  <br> NOTE:  A service-disabled veteran (or in the case of a service-disabled veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such veteran) must hold the highest officer position in the concern (usually President or Chief Executive Officer) and must have managerial experience of the extent and complexity needed to run the concern. The service-disabled veteran manager (or in the case of a veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such veteran) need not have the technical expertise or possess the required license to be found to control the concern if the service-disabled veteran can demonstrate that he or she has ultimate managerial and supervisory control over those who possess the required licenses or technical expertise.  <br>  <br> (d)	The most applicable North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541690, Energy Consulting Services (standard of $14M).

<DESC><strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE - THIS IS A NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE AWARD TO IMMUNALYSIS CORPORATION TO ASSIST THE OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR PERSONNEL AND READINESS WITH MISSION CRITICAL SUPPORT.</strong><br /><br />WHS Acquisition Directorate intends to issue a contract to Immunalysis Corporation on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) Drug Demand Reduction Program (DDRP) was mandated in 1981 and given the mission to deter DoD personnel from using prohibited drugs. The DoD DDRP policy for military service members is promulgated in DoD Directive 1010.1, with detailed guidance concerning drug testing procedures contained in DoD Directive 1010.16. The DoD DDRP is aligned with DoD policies that pertain to health and readiness within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.<br /><br />DDRP's mission involves compulsory random drug testing with punitive consequences, anti-drug education, and treatment. The effectiveness of this program is measured by monitoring the prevalence of drug use from drug testing statistics published annually.<br /><br />DDRP conducts testing at six DoD Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratories (FTDTLs), as well as the Forensic Toxicology Laboratory of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System (FORTOX-AFMES). Each location currently uses the Hitachi / Roche D-Modular Analyzer System(s) to perform mission critical testing. There are approximately 24 D-Modular systems spread throughout DDRP's testing environment. The Government has invested approximatly $4.32M in its existing instrumentation which enables DDRP to meet mission goals.
<p>The DDRP has a mission critical requirement to test the use of synthetic cannabinoids by members of the Military Services. As such, this effort is to procure immunoassay reagents to be used on the Government's existing Hitachi / Roche instrumentation to meet the Government's need. (Note: There is currently not a requirement to replace the existing analyzer systems.)</p>
<p>Since the introduction and widespread use of synthetic cannabinoids into the drug culture, the DDRP has conducted a joint effort with the National Institute of Drug Abuse and AFMES to identify a strategy to deter and detect the use of synthetic cannabinoids by military personnel. In the course of this effort, Immunalysis Corporation was identified as the only manufacturer of an immunoassay reagent capable of identifying the broad class of synthetic cannabinoid parent and/or metabolites found in urine as a result of synthetic cannabinoid abuse on the existing analyzer systems currently in use at the FTDTLs and FORTOX-AFMES.</p>
<p>Therefore, the initial contract action will be established with Immunalysis Corporation as an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for a period of 12 months, from approximately 01 MAR 2013 through 28 FEB 2014, and will include four (4) 12 month option periods. WHS Acquisition Directorate anticipates issuing firm fixed price delivery orders under this contract to meet the mission critical needs of DDRP. The minimum order amount is $26,000.00 and the not-to-exceed maximum total is $7.0M.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that another manufactured immunoassay reagent capable of identifying the broad class of synthetic cannabinoid parent and or metablites found in urine as a result of synthetic cannabinoid abuse is compatible with the existing Hitachi / Roche D-Modular Analyzer System(s). If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be issued without further notice. Interested parties may identify their capabilities with respect to this requirement by 25 JAN 2013, at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. All information received will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 339999 (All Other Miscellaneous Manufacturing), with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>

<DESC>AFRL/RQAC has a mandate to support a wide range of computational requirements for future Air Force systems. However, the initial focus for this Collaborative Center will be on developing and integrating all of the computational tools required to perform reliable, high-fidelity, multi-disciplinary analysis of high speed flows, fine-scale unsteady flows, and computational methods. As such, the CCAS will need to perform research in the following technical areas:
<p>i. High Speed Aero-Physics (for example, thermal/chemical non-equilibrium, rarefied/continuum flow, MHD, hypersonic configurations, shock-shock and shock boundary layer interactions, scramjet flow path analysis, supersonic combustion, steady and unsteady heat transfer, conjugate heat transfer, thermal loads, flow control, etc.)</p>
<p>ii. Fine-Scale Unsteadiness (for example, boundary layers, transition prediction, turbulence excitation/suppression, turbulence models, LES/DNS, separated flow, flow control, plasma/fluidic/mechanical actuation, secondary flow, shear layers, wake flow, acoustic/EM wave propagation, etc.)</p>
<p>iii. Enabling CFD technologies (for example, nonlinear/nonlinear fluid-structure coupling, grid motion/adaptation, generalized overset techniques, high-order and robust algorithms, uncertainty quantification, grid/geometry sensitivities, error assessment, software V&amp;V, computational model experimental validation, interoperable/framework computing, etc.)</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this study is to conduct technical, business, marketing and programmatic analysis of the market for a Next Generation Star Tracker System. Specifically, the Title III Program Office is interested in determining the feasibility of producing a modular, Next Generation Star Tracker Systems (NGSTS) that uses domestically-produced Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) detectors. Efforts envisioned during this study include: analysis of current star tracker manufacturing capabilities; analysis of future technical capabilities needed to meet the needs of the star tracker market (domestic and international, USG and commercial); analysis of NGSTS capabilities using state-of-the-art detector capabilities such as those resulting from Defense Production Act Title III Advanced CMOS Capability Project; proposed architecture options for creating a system of star trackers; creation of a draft technical plan and schedule, with (non-binding) high-level cost projections, to establish production capabilities for a NGSTS; identification and analysis of the markets for a modular NGSTS; and identification of business strategies for success in the NGSTS market. It is anticipated that the technical product of this study will be used to create a draft systems requirement document for a NGSTS.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for STAR CCM+ Software and training. Items follow: 1. STAR-CCM+ POWER SESSION (1501.2) ANL 2. STAR-CCM+ Additional Session (1106.2) 3. STAR-CCM+/CAD EXCHANGE (1309.2) ANL NASA/KSC intends to purchase these items from CD-Adapco. CD-Adapco is the manufacturer and sole proprietary of the STAR CCM+ Software. No known vendors can supply this software and training. KSC's Launch Services Program is frequently called upon to provide quick turnaround analyses on complex geometries. STAR-CCM+ has a unique and comprehensive suite of geometry creation and preparation tools that significantly reduce the number of man-hours required to process the geometry through grid generation and solution. The built-in 3D CAD tool allows for parametric geometry creation, import and modification as well as automatic fluid extraction. The surface wrapper "shrink-wraps" a high-quality triangulated surface onto the geometry, closing holes, joining disconnected and overlapping surfaces, as well as automatically discarding obsolete surfaces. This capability will significantly reduce the time required to incorporate satellite geometry into the fairing models for environmental control system performance calculations in support of spacecraft customer requirement verification/validation. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and 13. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 10:00 A.M. local time on January 14, 2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed. CD-Adapco's quote is due in writing (email preferred to kristina.irastorza@nasa.gov) not later than10:00 A.M. local time on January 14, 2013.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p><br />Brand Name Justification:<br />Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1(c) - Brand name <br /><br />One of the critical steps for DNA Sequencing is high quality DNA fragments in which the high performance Ultrasonicator is a necessary powerful tool. Covaris, Inc. is the sole manufacturer of the S220 High Performance Ultrasonicator. The Covaris technological foundation is based on its proprietary and patented AFA technology. The AFA technology enables a vast array of non-contact, isothermal processes to be developed, for use in a broad range of applications in Genomics, Proteomics, Cell Biology, and Drug Discovery research.

<p>The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance.  The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.  The past performance subfactors are listed below in order of relative importance.  These subfactors will be used to evaluate the quality of past performance.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance Subfactors:<br />&bull;	Record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship<br />&bull;	Adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance<br />&bull;	Reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction<br />&bull;	Business-like concern for the interest of the customer</p>
<p><br />4.  Price    (Price will be evaluated separately but not scored).</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio TX 78249.  Non-personal support services are required to assist ISR to evaluate the effects of low temperature storage on platelets for transfusion.  The services include evaluation of platelet hemostatic function under shear stress using a rheometer to mimic in-vivo blood flow forces, evaluation of the viscoelastic properties of blood clots via rheological properties, storage and loss moduli, and complex viscosity, SEM imaging of formed clots, and changes in platelet receptor glycosylation.  UTSA was chosen for this study because of its proximity to ISR, temperature control is paramount to the success of this study, also because platelets respond to movement and vibration the provided samples can only be moved a short distance to keep the validity of the study. This notice of intent is for information purposes only.  All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly articulate the ability to provide services outlined above.  A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response.  If no responses are received, within 15 days after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made.  Response to this notice is to be sent to john.fitzsimmons@us.army.mil.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200022 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 335911.  The small business size standard is 500 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft:

It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Saft America Inc. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.
It is the Government's belief that the OEM Saft America Inc. is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  
Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>

DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>Delivery must be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 30 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 12 Dec 2012. ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered and posted. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

    (2) __ Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

<DESC>This Amendment (CCSA1) amends the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation VA317-13-R-0003 to include the statement of work which was inadvertently left out of the posting on 1/8/2013.  Please note that the presolicitation issued on 1/7/2013 - VA317-13-R-0002 pertains to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation VA317-13-R-0003, hence, there are not two "roof repair" jobs at the Saint Petersburg FL Regional Office.

The site visit for the job is still being held on January 10, 2013, promptly at 11:00 am EST and the due date for proposals is still due January 14, 2013, 3:00 pm via email:  teresa.edwards1@va.gov.


STATEMENT OF WORK FOR ROOF REPAIR BEGINS:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for an urgent roof repair for the St. Petersburg Regional Office. This is the only solicitation that will be posted. No other proposal will be provided. Any questions regarding this combined synopsis/solicitation must be provided via email to the contracting officer: Teresa.edwards1@va.gov. All questions must be email no later than 11am EST on Friday, January 11, 2013. All questions and answers will be posted on www.fbo.gov by 3pm EST on Friday, January 11, 2013.

The NAICS Code is 238160 with a size standard of $14.0 million, construction, roof repairs. This requirement is 100% set aside for Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.
This acquisition is solicited pursuant to Public Law 109-461, 38 USC section 8127, as a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside. Additionally, this acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process (LPTA). The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Benefits Administration intends to award one (1) firm-fixed price contract for the roof repair requirement.

Successful offeror(s) will be required to be actively registered in System for Award Management (SAM), upon submission of proposal. Due to the urgent need of roof repairs, if vendors are not active in SAM, this could be a reason for non-responsiveness. Offeror(s) not already registered in the SAM database are highly encouraged to register via internet at www.sam.gov. In accordance with FAR 4.1201(a) Prospective contractors shall complete Electronic Annual Representations and Certifications (ORCA) now completed through the SAM database. Vendors must be listed in the Vetbiz.gov Vendor Information Pages at www.vetbiz.gov and be CVE certified.

SCOPE OF WORK

The St. Petersburg Regional Office's current roof is in a deteriorating condition.  The area of concern is the roof area around the skylight, and the numerous equipment penetrations through the roof.  Correction is needed of the negative roof deck slope that directs water towards the base of the skylight. Per current recommendations of the National Roofing Contractors Association, standing seam metal roofs should have a minimum positive drainage slope of " per foot of run. Upon review of the original building plans and details, a positive drainage slope of minimum " per foot of run was indicated for the metal roof deck. While on six of the eight skylight sides the roof does appear to have a positive drainage slope away to the building perimeter, the two problematic areas do not. The decking appears to have been subject to excessive deflection between the purlin support elements directly at the skylight perimeter, resulting in a permanent bending of the deck surface and resultant ponding of water at the skylight base. While it may be possible to reverse the deck deflection from beneath (via the interstitial space between metal deck and concrete roof deck), a more likely and preferred scenario will be adding spray on polyurethane to metal decking atop the existing to provide the required positive slope.

<DESC>Please note that the Planned Acquisition and Submission Information sections have been updated from the original posting. <br>  <br> Description:   <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager, Maneuver Ammunition Systems (PM-MAS), is seeking possible sources to develop, test, qualify and produce high and low velocity grenade 40mm Target Practice Day/ Night/ Thermal (TP-D/N/T) training cartridges.    <br>    <br>  The desired training cartridges employ a projectile which provides an impact signature that is visible day and night by the unaided eye and through night-vision and thermal/infra-red weapon sights and which does not include energetics or other features which may generate an unexploded ordnance hazard.  HV 40mm TP-D/N/T training cartridge will be interoperable and fired from the Mk19 Mod 3 Grenade Machine Gun.  LV 40mm TP-D/N/T training cartridge will be interoperable and fired from M203 and M320 grenade launchers. The desired training cartridges propulsion system will be insensitive to environmental effects. Offerors are expected to provide an estimated Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) along with substantiating design, analysis, testing and manufacturing data to support the TRL/ MRL claim. Offerors are free to discuss how the low velocity concepts would be different from or similar to high velocity concepts.   <br>    <br>  Specifications:     <br>  Draft versions of the performance specifications for the 40mm HV &LV TP-D/N/T Training Cartridges will be available upon request. The performance specification details the signature requirements with respect to duration, range and visibility.  To request the performance specification, the requestor must be a DoD contractor and registered in an active status in the Defense Logistics Information Service, U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (See www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for instructions and information).  Offerors should submit their certification via DD Form 2345 or register immediately.  An offeror's delay in doing so will not be a basis to extend the closing date of this market survey.  The performance specification has been labeled Distribution Statement F: Further dissemination only as directed by SFAE-AMO-MAS, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ,07806-5000, or higher DoD authority.  Reproduction requires approval of originator, SFAE-AMO-MAS, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, 07806- 5000 or higher DoD authority.  The performance specifications are controlled by international traffic in arms regulations, foreign sources must submit an export license request.  Interested companies will be required to return/destroy the performance specification when requested by the Government.  Offerors are free to discuss how the low velocity concepts would be different from or similar to high velocity concepts.  If and when a solicitation is released detailed information regarding which sights will be utilized to evaluate the bid samples will be released.   <br>    <br> Planned Acquisition:   <br> The Government envisions releasing separate RFPs in the third quarter FY13 for high velocity and low velocity and conducting a bid sample test in the fourth quarter FY13 timeframe. Multiple awards for each high and low velocity Engineering and Manufacturing Development are anticipated for the second quarter FY14 timeframe with a possible down select to occur prior to low rate initial production, which would begin approximately at the end of FY15.  Any resulting contracts (one for high velocity and one for low velocity) may contain up to three options for production. Load, assemble and pack, propellant, cartridge case components, and projectile bodies may be restricted to the national technology and industrial base for production. The contract type will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP).  The primary outcomes sought under this effort will be the qualification of training cartridges and obtaining Government Purpose rights to the technical data for the cartridges.  The Government intends to use the technical data package as a basis for future full and open procurements.  The Government requests that Offerors submit information regarding data rights and Offeror requirements for the Government to obtain those rights. <br>  <br> Submission Information:   <br> THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION.  An offeror is encouraged to submit information for both high and low velocity capabilities, however if they only have the capability for high velocity or low velocity they are still encouraged to submit information on the one velocity capability they have.  Please be advised that the Government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement.  Interested companies should submit their qualifications and capabilities electronically within 30 days of this notice to: US Army Contracting Command- New Jersey, ACC-NJ-MA, Brad Borek Bldg 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 or by email to: bradley.r.borek.civ@mail.mil.  Interested companies should respond by providing the Government the following information:  <br> (1) Name of company and CAGE Code;  <br> (2) Point of Contacts name, telephone number and E-mail address;  <br> (3) Company address;  <br> (4) Business size information;  <br> (5) Identification of whether you are interested in this opportunity as a prime or a subcontractor;  <br> (6) A brief summary of the companys capabilities (to include organizations, description of facilities, equipment, manufacturing process, inspection capability, skills, personnel) and potential subcontractor's capabilities;  <br> (7) A brief summary of potential visible and thermal technology solutions for 40mm cartridges,  <br> (8) A brief summary of possible partnering/teaming arrangements;  <br> (9) Estimated TRL level of HV and LV designs and substantiating data; <br> (10) Technical Data assertions and willingness to sell rights to the Government, and  <br> (11) A list of all data pertaining to this effort which the company does not desire to sell to the Government. <br>  <br> Please identify any proprietary information submitted.  A respondent to this survey must have a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture this item.  If a respondent does not have these resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, then it must demonstrate its ability to obtain them in a reasonable time period.  If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet the same resource criteria as the prime contractor.    <br>  <br> This is a market survey, not a pre-solicitation notice.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date a solicitation notice will be published.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.

<DESC>This modification to the Solicitation FORCE XXI BATTLE COMMAND BRIGADE AND BELOW (FBCB2) MOUNTED FAMILY of COMPUTER SYSTEMS (m-FoCS) is to extend the proposal Response Date from 25 September 2012 to 17 October 2012.  Due to the recent questions from industry and variation between the Draft RFP and the Final RFP, the Government feels that such an extension is warranted.  This extension will also impact the Equipment Evaluation by extending the delivery date for each offeror's equipment and materials from 1 October 2012 to 10 October 2012.  <br><br>With regard to solicitation questions posted via the ASFI website, the Government will not respond to questions posted after 24 September 2012, 1630 EDT.  The Government will review all questions and/or comments presented before that deadline; however, the Government reserves the right to respond or not respond to any questions or comments received after 24 September 2012, 1630 EDT. <br><br>The Government posted a Secure Document Package (SDP) to ASFI on 23 August 2012.   The Government has also recently posted a SDP for the drawings called out in Performance Specification paragraph 3.1.2.2 which references the existing JV5 isolator mounts. These SDPs can be accessed under the heading: "m-FoCS Documents" and "m-FoCS Mounts."  Vendors must create a log-in to request access to the SDPs in accordance with the Vendor access instructions at the link below.  In order to obtain access to the SDPs, the Government will require a submission of form DD 2345 and will provide a Non-Disclosure agreement (NDA) to be signed and returned.  This NDA states the following, "The Recipient shall require its employees, subcontractors or suppliers, or prospective subcontractors or suppliers, or vendors (hereinafter referred to as 'Receiving Party or Parties') to sign a Use and Non Disclosure Agreement (U&NDA) prior to disclosing or releasing these Data to such persons or entities."  The Government never provided a sample U&NDA.  Thus, in lieu of a signed U&NDA, the Government is requiring that the Authorized Representative for each offeror, who is signing the NDA for access to the SDP, provide a list of all "Receiving Parties" to the Contract Specialist James.P.Purdy10.civ@mail.mil no later than 24 September 2012, 1630 EDT.  Offerors with access to the SDP posted on 23 August 2012 will be required to request access to the SDP posted with Amendment 0001 of Solicitation W15P7T-12-R-0001 through the ASFI website.  Offerors currently with access to the SDP will not be required to resubmit any documentation with the exception of the above mentioned list of all "Receiving Parties" in order to gain access to the SDP posted with Amendment 0001.<br><br>Vendor access instructions are available at the following link (copy & paste into your url): https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=getstart&mode=list&tab=list&tabmode=list&static=guides<br>

The RFP issued 23 Aug 2012 is the definitive document for the m-FoCS solicitation.  Any documents released prior to this date were issued for informational use only.<br><br>2. The space envelopes for the Basic, Intermediate and Advanced solutions are based upon agreements with the platform Project Managers, reflecting the maximum space claim available for the m-FoCS solution.  These space envelopes are set forth in the 23 Aug 2012 RFP. <br><br>3. The Government will accept hardware for the equipment evaluation that does not conform to the space claim in the specification, provided that the proposal addresses how the offeror intends to meet the requirement.  Equipment Evaluation submissions not meeting the minimum specification requirements will be considered when assessing the maturity of the proposed solution. The fact that equipment may not meet the space claim requirement at the time of the Equipment Evaluation will not be considered as part of the Government's evaluation of the performance of the equipment.<br>

This is a DRFP made available for comment prior to the Pre-Solicitation Conference. This is not a solicitation and CBMS is not requesting proposals at this time.  <br>  The Department of Defense (DoD) is pursuing the advanced development of an INATS through to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and optional delivery of procurement quantities.  An improved nerve agent therapeutic and treatment system is necessary to counter the threat of conventional nerve agents as well as against nontraditional agents and emerging threats.  To accomplish this goal, CBMS - Medical Identification and Treatment Systems (MITS) Joint Product Office intends to award a single contract to achieve all activities necessary to successfully deliver an FDA-approved autoinjector containing an improved oxime formulation and atropine, to replace the fielded Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Autoinjector (ATNAA), containing the oxime 2-pralidoxime (2-PAM) and atropine.  The contract will include options to provide for the delivery of Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and Full Operational Capability (FOC) quantity requirements. Additionally, the INATS development effort may include development of formulation enhancements that increase product efficacy (survival) against a broad spectrum of nerve agents as well as stability at operationally relevant temperatures and temperature extremes.  <br>    <br>  This DRFP is released under announcement number W911QY-13-R-0018.  Release of this DRFP is not a commitment by the Government to award a contract and the Government is not liable to reimburse any costs incurred by companies or entities that respond in any way to this DRFP or participate in the PreSolicitation Conference.   <br>    <br>  Any information concerning the INATS Pre-Solicitation Conference will be amended to the DRFP and posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website at https://www.fbo.gov under announcement number W911QY-13-R-0018 and at http://www3.natick.army.mil/inats.html.  <br>     <br>    <br>  CBMS will only accept questions regarding this DRFP in writing via e-mail to Mr. Richard Totten at richard.w.totten2.civ@mail.mil with the subject  quote mark INATS DRFP Comments/Questions. quote mark   <br>    <br>  The Government will not accept any questions after 5:00 pm EST, 08 February 2013.

This is not a Solicitation Announcement and is not a Request for Proposals; and does not obligate the Government to any contract award. The purpose of this Sources Sought synopsis is to determine interest and capability of potential qualified Small Business Administration (SBA) certified: 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB)  firms relative to the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 518210 (Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services). The Small Business Size Standard is $25 million.

The incumbent contractor is Xotech L.L.C., Tyrone GA. The current order number is W911SE-08-F-0207, awarded under GSA.    <br>  <br> PROJECT INFORMATION:  <br> The scope of work involves providing the USARC a web based means to interface and manage the excess for the Standard Army Management Information System (STAMIS) system in order to provide a management capability for the command and staff.  The units use these STAMIS on a daily basis to provide information that feeds the army database upon which decisions about unit value, modernization, and relevance are based.   <br>  <br> The dwindling availability of resources has dramatically increased the need for data from many sources, databases, multiple organizations and information sources enabling the USARC to manage their supplies and financial process effectively.  These types of data are not currently available in any one standard system.  Once of the many missions of the USARC G4 Distribution Management Center (DMC) is to manage Class VII end items throughout the command, and ensure that excess items are cross-leveled/laterally transferred across the command.  In order to accomplish these objectives, there are many associated functions, to include: (1) Requisition Validation (REQ-VAL); (2) Asset Visibility (AV); (3) Unit Status Reporting 9USR); (4) Lateral Transfer Directives; (5) Automated Management Reports; (6) Availability Balance File/Authorization Balance File (ABF) visibility; (7) multiple STAMIS interfaces; (8) Multiple Catalog and Authorization files; and (9) controlled access to the Relational Database via Internet.

<DESC>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
<p>GROUND POWER:</p>
<p>QUESTION: Can you provide more specifications on cargo compartment portable ground power unit. Most GPUs are too big for cargo compartment , but an electrical starting unit is small enough to fit. <br /><br />ANSWER: The intent of the ground power unit is to provide ground power for an extended period of time for new pilots to learn/practice the avionics interface without having to run the engine. If the contractor cannot furnish one small enough to be aircraft portable, we can accept that.<br /><br />However, we do need engine-off ground power for up to four hours in a day at the aircraft's primary operating location. My estimate is based on two pilot students each spending two hours in a single day being introduced to the aircraft's avionics system.</p>
<p>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUALS:</p>
<p>QUESTION: The Below link shows mentioned items for Aircraft Maintenance Manual and Illustrated Part Catalog the question is do you really need the whole manuals in paper document or will a link be sufficient Cirrus manufacture post those items on line?</p>
<p>ANSWER:the manufacturer's link is sufficient for the proposal. However, the intent is for the government to be able to verify that the contractor can produce documentary evidence (if requested) that the aircraft in their proposal is properly maintained in accordance with these manuals.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTOR TRAINING:</p>
<p>QUESTION: The new "edits" in Section I, paragraph 1.1.1 seem to imply that the contractor will have to train the "initial cadre of military instructor pilots..." where as the questions and answers state that "Air force initial flight instructors have already been trained." Please clarify that statement. Does the contractor have to train the Air Force pilots or not and if so how many and how many hours?</p>
<p>ANSWER:&nbsp;The contractor will not have to train any military pilots.</p>
<p>Paragraph 1.1.1 describes the broad intent of our program. Our initial cadre of pilots have already been trained outside of this contract. The only requirement is for the contractor to periodically provide a qualified pilot, not for training, but for functional check flights, basic positioning of the aircraft for maintenance, etc (see para 1.2.2.1). An example scenario is if the aircraft required some maintenance that could not be accomplished on site. The contractor could be requested to ferry the aircraft to/from the maintenance location. The frequency with which we would require a contractor pilot is unpredictable since we cannot predict maintenance issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;THE BID CLOSING DATE REMAINS 11 JAN 2013 10AM PST</p>

<DESC>RFI for NVIS Compatible Lighting Improvement forC-130H2 Aircraft Fuel Quantity Gauges   <br>      <br>   As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.209 (c), the following provision is inserted:    <br>      <br>   IAW FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information (Oct 1997)    <br>      <br>   (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the FAR.     <br>      <br>   (b) Although proposal and offers are used in this request for information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.    <br>      <br>   (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying information on aircraft cockpit lighting technologies that have already been developed or may be modified from other Aerospace Industry solutions to meet the agency requirement as listed below:   <br>      <br>   The Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test Center (AATC) is conducting an effort to determine potential sources for improving the night vision goggle compatible lighting for fuel gauges used in Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)  C-130H2 or earlier aircraft.  This announcement is for market research and does not constitute a request for proposal. This is not an R&D request.   <br>      <br>   AATC is seeking contractors interested in providing affordable, readily available NVIS compatible light system for the C-130H2 fuel gauges NSN 6680-012204091 (Fuel Gauge-Totalizer); and NSN 6680 01 220 4090, 6680 01 290 5920; 6680-013508049 (Fuel Gauge-Primary Quantity).  The system must provide a fully NVIS compatible solution by adding backlighting or an improved secondary lighting source.  This modification must use the latest military and/or commercial off-the shelf (COTS) technology that can be used as part of an Operational Assessment (OA).     <br>      <br>   System Requirements:    <br>      <br>    	NVIS compatible   <br>    	Solutions must ensure smooth and predictable dimming, equal or better than the legacy incandescent dimming design.    <br>    	Provide daylight readability.     <br>    	System should be form, fit and function using the existing wiring or with minor modification.   <br>    	System must be physically robust.   <br>    	LED technology preferred.   <br>    	System must allow instruments to maintain cooling characteristics.   <br>    	System should provide improvement over existing post lights/secondary lighting.   <br>    	System should prevent any glow or light leakage which may cause non-NVIS compatibility.    <br>      <br>   Objective of OA is to demonstrate and validate potential solutions for recommendation for fielding options within the next 1-3 years.  Proposed start dates for testing is 1 Mar 2013.  Actual fielding decision is beyond the scope, intent, or authority of this RFI or OA.  Potential for follow-on procurement is dependent on results of tests and availability of funding.  The government is looking for a system that offers the best value to the government, not necessarily the lowest procurement cost.  Mission effectiveness and safety are key considerations.   <br>      <br>   Interested parties capable of providing a NVIS compatible system that meets or exceeds the above requirements, shall provide a statement of capability (SOC) that demonstrates the existing capability to provide, modify, and sustain the system, along with a description of system capabilities. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) is requested as part of the RFI and will be used as market research. The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify the system capability as related to the technical effort requested. A limit of fifty (50) pages is imposed for the responses, which should be received by 7 Jan 2013.  Testing results are expected to determine the most effective system.    <br>      <br>   Please e-mail all information and SOC to the AATC Contracting Officer, SMSgt Jonathan Wood, at jonathan.wood.1@ang.af.mil. For programmatic questions or technical questions contact John Wilkens at john.wilkens@ang.af.mil or Herbert Colon at herbert.colon.ctr@ang.af.mil. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to directly pay for any information or responses submitted as the result of this synopsis.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

Dresser-Rand is the original equipment manufacturer and the only company that can fulfill the additional requirements.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested companies may submit their interest to the modification requirement by 10 January 2013.
  All questions regarding this modification should be submitted in writing to the Contract Specialist, Edwin Baldoria, via email: edwin.baldoria@navy.mil

A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction.

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration.

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.
