<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Program Support Center is soliciting proposals from interested academic health centers (AHCs) located in the Public Health Service (PHS) Region VIII which includes Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. The purpose of this project is to select an AHC in Region VIII as a demonstration projects for diverse womens health programs in the development of a National Center of Excellence in Womens Health (CoE.) Currently, HHS has the funding to make award to only one AHC under the solicitation.  However, the solicitation will provide for the flexibility to make multiple awards in the event that funds become available and that favorable proposals are received from multiple sources. The CoE program is a national model program to advance and improve womens health care. The CoE model includes a comprehensive, coordinated, and integrated program in 5 key areas: the retention and promotion of women faculty, professional education, community outreach and public education, clinical care, and research. In FY 2004 the CoE program was transformed with emphasis now directed to professional education incorporating allied health professionals; prevention activities addressing cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity, cancer, HIV and AIDS, mental health, violence against women, adolescents, and older women; and those serving underserved populations, especially American Indians. The current 21 CoEs are addressing these issues, serving as premiere womens health care facilities across the country, establishing national models. A comprehensive 2 year national evaluation was completed in 2003 showing the significant impact the national designation makes in the delivery and improvement of women=s health care services. In FY 2004, 2 AHCs were awarded CoE Demonstration Project contracts. They are the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, and the University of South Dakota, Sioux Falls. The Office on Womens Health (OWH) shall provide technical assistance to develop a model program in any of the AHCs in the states of Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming in the PHS Region VIII that meet the criteria within this RFP and are closest to implementing a model CoE program within their institution.

<ARCHDATE>05302005
<CONTACT>Kathy P. Swanson,(931) 454-4409
<DESC>BAA 05-01-AEDC/PKP:  The Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) in response to the request by the Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center (DTRMC) is soliciting research proposals in the area of hypersonics testing and evaluation/science and technology (T+E/S+T) development.  DTRMC seeks innovative proposals in the hypersonics area that will allow improved test and evaluation of current systems and future systems over the next 10 to 15 years.  The goal is not to perform basic research, but to develop subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. The results of this type of effort are proof of technological feasibility and assessment of subsystem and component operability and producibility rather than the development of hardware for service use.  DTRMC seeks advances in hypersonic and related technologies in the areas of (not in priority):  1) COMBUSTION AND NON-INTRUSIVE FLOW DIAGNOSTICS for ground test applications (applications to flight test is a plus), specifically, non-intrusive measurement capability for determination of species concentration, temperature, and/or velocities in flows associated with hypersonic test facilities and scramjet engines are required.  Robust systems capable of working reliably in a test environment, that are minimally intrusive to the test article and facil!  ity hardware, and have the capability of retrieving spatially resolved flow parameters are especially needed.  2) CONCEPTS FOR AUTONOMOUS FLIGHT TERMINATION SYSTEMS FOR HYPERSONIC FLIGHT TEST VEHICLES are required.  3) Technologies that aid in the STRUCTURAL TESTING or provide new capabilities in testing of materials and whole vehicle static structural testing at elevated temperatures and pressure conditions that simulate hypersonic flight conditions are required.  4) NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE VARIABLE MACH NUMBER HYPERSONIC GROUND TESTING facilities that will provide hypersonic flight trajectory simulation capabilities are required.  Specifically, enabling technologies for large scale ground testing of integrated turbine based combined cycle/ramjet/scramjet inlet and mode transition testing are required.   It is expected that a modified AEDC Aeropropulsion Engine Test Facility (ASTF) (with extension of Mach number to 4 or 5) will be the only viable candidate for such a large scale integrated propulsion test capability and therefore will be the only viable candidate for receiving the proposed technology.  5) CLEAN AIR HEATER TECHNOLOGIES for hypersonic test facilities capable of providing reliable non-vitiated air for hypersonic testing applications is required; 6) MODELING AND SIMULATION (M+S) efforts that have application to test and evaluation are required. Areas of interest include: integrated propulsion system and airframe performance models, high speed (+M5) store separation, aerothermal heat transfer with application to aerodynamic shaping and thermal management including aerothermal chemistry and boundary-layer transition effects, transient modeling incorporating the effects of inlet un-start and combustor dynamics, electron beam energy addition to high pressure flows, !  ultra high pressure aerothermal equation of state of air (approx. 300,000 psi).  M+S efforts with demonstrated verification of predictive/modeling capabilities using existing or acquisition of new data are preferred, and must possess strong test and evaluation applications.  M+S proposals must possess a strongly stated T+E application justification. M+S proposals with primarily system development application will receive little or no preference.  PROJECT SCOPE:  Awards totaling approximately $2.5-$3.0M are expected to be made in FY06.  Increased funding levels are anticipated to occur in the following fiscal years.  The prospective proposers should be aware that there is no certainty in the funding or level of effort.  GENERAL INFORMATION:   Proposals should address development and/or operational test and evaluation technologies. DTRMC strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities.  Teaming among academia, industry, and/or government partners is encouraged; however, this is not a requirement.   Projects with strong transition plans to DoD T+E ground or flight test facilities or with DoD T+E facility participation will receive preference.  Because awards may be made in which contractors expect to access or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public, the contracts will contain DFARS Clause 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information.  This requirement will be in subcontracts as well. Projects will be awarded in phases with the later phases being funded in FY07 or later and will be contingent on fund availability, merit of performance in previous phases, and anticipated future T+E requirements for the technologies being addressed.  In order to minimize the magnitude of the proposal preparation and review process, a proposal abstract of no more than 15 pages total should be submitted by 5 Apr 05.  Each proposal should specify the benefiting U.S.  military service and the executing organization with subcontractors (where applicable), and their specific roles.  The proposal should briefly describe the out-year effort beyond completion of the phase I effort.  Each proposal should address a specific T+E hypersonic need.  Each proposer and subcontractor will be required to submit written verification stating they are aware of their responsibility to have DoD approval for public release of information pertaining to the proposed project (including technical reports, papers, and presentations) as required by DoD regulations regarding the dissemination of militarily critical technologies and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  EVALUATION: Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria:  (1) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) relevance to current T+E hypersonic technology test requirements not addressed in other DoD programs(3) offeror's capabilities and related experience, (4) cost realism of proposed effort, and (5) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition to T+E application and/or to DoD T+E facilities.  Upon review, AEDC will respond to proposal abstracts with a recommendation to submit or not to submit a full proposal and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposals and proposal abstracts should be submitted on CD-ROM in .pdf format and forwarded to:  AEDC/PKP, Attn:  Kathy P. Swanson, 1!  00 Kindel Drive, Suite A332, Arnold AFB, TN 37389-1332.

<SUBJECT>D -- NATO NC3A Notification of Intent (NOI) to invite bids related to its plan to provide Long Term SATCOM and FOC CIS Services to support ISAF expansion in Afghanistan
<SOLNBR>IFB-CO-11482-OPL
<RESPDATE>032405
<ARCHDATE>03252005
<CONTACT>David Newsom, Trade & Industry Analyst - NATO Company Certification, Phone 202-482-7417, Fax 202-482-5650, Email dnewsom@bis.doc.gov
<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) has issued a Notification of Intent (NOI) of its Intention for Bidding (IFB) from all NATO countries for the provision of Long Term Satellite Communications System (SATCOM) and Final Operational Capability (FOC) Communications Information Systems (CIS) services to support the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Expansion in Afghanistan. The Infrastructure Committee of the North Atlantic Council noted that the project will be handled under the Two-Stage Authorization Procedure. This project will be funded by the NATO Security Investment Program with a potential estimated cost of over 70 million Euros ($90 million USD).

NC3A will procure the capability through the use of NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures (AC/4-D/2261 1996 Edition). Contractor selection will be based on the lowest compliant bid (One Envelope Procedure).

The reference of the Invitation For Bid (IFB) is IFB-CO-11482-OPL and all correspondence concerning this procurement shall reference this number. This opportunity was previously advertised by the U.S. Department of Commerce on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on 26 October 2004 using its project number, 2004-5VA30224-0-9, as its solicitation number. The new solicitation number / reference number, IFB-CO-11482-OPL, supersedes the previous one.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The North Atlantic Council has approved the expansion of the ISAF mission to support a number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and forward operating bases expanding the current ISAF area of operation. This has resulted in a very urgent operational requirement to provide the long-term communications and Communications and Information Systems (CIS) infrastructure to enable the Commander of ISAF to exercise command and control over this enlarged mission. In addition to the urgency of this requirement, there is a critical shortage of available deployable NATO CIS capability, both in terms of equipment and manpower. Analysis conducted by Allied Command Operations concluded that it is inappropriate to use military equipment to provide satellite baseband support for the ISAF mission expansion. These scarce assets are required for the NATO Response Force (NRF) and there is a very high cost of deploying military containers and vehicles to Afghanistan. This ISAF CIS solution is expected to be needed for at least five (5) years. Discussions with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) showed even if this capability was available today, the scalable and expected long term nature of CIS support to ISAF would still best be served by outsourcing a service to provide this capability. NATO will require its limited deployable CIS assets for the NRF which may be tasked with rapid and short duration deployments. The required capability will provide CIS services and their embedded communications services from a NATO manned facility in Kabul to over 30 remote locations, or Points of Presence (POP), within Afghanistan where other NATO units will be based. This includes local CIS network infrastructure, equipment and personnel. Any contractor delivered solution must be capable of supporting further ISAF mission expansion if and when this is authorized by NATO.

This project considers and uses, where possible, equipment from earlier projects, specifically serial 2004/5VA30223 Provide Commercial SATCOM to Support ISAF Expansion (IOC). Only equipment and services considered essential to expand and support ISAF expansion complying with the Minimum Military Requirement (MMR) are requested.

SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS

Operational Technical: This SATCOM/CIS system shall have the capability to support up to 30 Points of Presence (POP) located in remote sites. Each site will include SATCOM ground terminals; and associated data and voice networking equipment to support voice and data communications between the remote site and the ISAF Headquarters. The SATCOM/CIS system provides intra-theater support and up to three strategic rear links (inter-theater) to the ISAF (Afghanistan) Theater of Operations.

Current ISAF Capability: NATO has deployed a SATCOM/CIS system in a limited number of sites with data and voice processing capability for a small number of users (2004/5VA30223). This was provided through commercial Ku-band and remote user data processing capability. Small PABXs were provided for secure and non-secure voice communications. The current number of sites is insufficient to support the expanded ISAF mission.

Technical Solution: The technical solution is composed of two parts: a bearer sub-system and an end-user sub-system. The bearer sub-system consists of the SATCOM links between the various sites and the associated terminal equipment. The NATO SATCOM Post 2000 SHF Space Segment (X-band) will be used to support this bearer system. The respective ground terminals and associated equipment will be provided by the contractor. The end-user segment consists of the CIS equipment to include data networking equipment and voice equipment. This project seeks a solution where a specific level of service is provided by the contractor. Therefore proposed solutions for the end-user segment must consider available SATCOM bandwidth and applicable NATO security guidance on Information Exchange. Each remote site shall include two communication links: one link between the remote site and its respective Regional Center and a second link between the same remote site and one of the two Theater hubs. The SATCOM Terminal and CIS equipment shall be housed in a self-contained, climate controlled shelter. Each shelter shall come with a generator to provide initial and back-up electrical power. Each shelter shall be transportable so redeployment is possible.

Security: System security accreditation shall be NATO SECRET releasable to ISAF. To this end, potential bidders will be asked to provide a system that has been certified by their National Accreditation Authority for the protection of National SECRET Information and that this system has been authorized by that nation for release to NATO for ISAF Operations. NATO will provide the cryptographic hardware which shall be operated by the contractor.

FOC: The implementation will be completed in stages with the first stage completed by mid-2006. Final Operational Capability must be achieved by the beginning of 2007 with a total of 30 sites installed to include 3 Regional Centers and 2 Theater Hubs.

IMPORTANT DATES AND DEADLINES:

1. Deadline to be certified and nominated to the bidder list: 24 March 2005

2. Planned IFB issue date: April 2005

3. Planned bid closing date: August 2005

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, Panama City, FL intends to issue a Sole Source Purchase Order to Saunders Yachtworks, 27075 Marina Road, Orange Beach, AL 36561 on a sole-source basis for the salvage of components from a recently wrecked 24 foot Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB), installation of those components onto another RHIB, and the performance of all work necessary to update this hull and one additional hull to the configuration established under contract N61331-00-C-0043. Saunders Yachtworks was competitively selected to perform the prototype design and installation of the new engine and drive train (Cummins BT5.9M1, Twin Disc MG-507 transmission, and Konrad 520 Outdrive). Saunders Yachtworks was subsequently awarded contract N61331-00-D-0043 to upgrade the configuration of 13 additional RHIB to the new engine and drive train configuration. The government did not procure a drawing package defining the work required to complete this conversion dur! ing the prototype stage. Based on the government's review of the cost to obtain a competitive technical data package suitable for competition of the subsequent conversion, contract N61331-00-D-0043 was awarded on a sole source basis. This situation has not changed, as the government still does not have a technical data package. Only Saunders Yachtworks has the necessary technical data to perform the work required to upgrade the configuration of the two RHIB to the new engine and drive train configuration required. This action will result in one fully configured RHIB, including the engine and drive train installed, and one RHIB converted to accept the new engine and drive train, but without the engine and drive train installed.  Award will be based on the written quotation. The anticipated award date will be on or about Mar 21, 2005. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  P! eriod of performance will be 90 days from issuance of the order. NAICS Code 336611.  Size Standard is 1000 employees.  PSC is J019. Note 22 applies.

<SUBJECT>B--Technical Support for Drinking Water Standard Development and Implementation of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation
<SOLNBR>PR-CI-05-10459
<CONTACT>WILLIAM M. YATES, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2055, E-Mail: yates.william@epa.gov
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Office of Water, Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW), Technical Support Center requires contractor support to provide technical, analytical and administrative support services for the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation.  This requirement is set aside for small business concerns and is entitled  "Technical Support for Drinking Water Standard Development and Implementation of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation"(UCMR). The Agency has the responsibility to investigate chemical, radiological and microbiological contaminant occurrence to characterize drinking water threats.  EPA relies on independent research efforts but also is heavily engaged in conducting occurrence studies to obtain new data.  The largest of these is the monitoring program mandated by the UCMR.  The UCMR is  a 5-year cyclic monitoring program, which allows OGWDW to evaluate contaminant occurrence in finished drinking water. Every five years, the UCMR is redefined through regulatory proposal and promulgation.  Data collected under UCMR can then be correlated with population in conducting an assessment of not only occurrence but also contaminant exposure.  The sound science strategy is to select for regulation the key contaminants which, when regulated, will maximize the protection of public health by most cost effectively ensuring drinking water quality and safety. Offerors interested in RFP PR-CI-05-10459 supporting "Technical Support for Drinking Water Standard Development and Implementation of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation" shall provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment, and facilities in support of the efforts included in the scope of the Statement of Work.   Tasks anticipated in this procurement include: 1) Coordinate the preparation and distribution of UCMR sample collection kits and collection of samples at selected small systems.  2) Assist with design of the UCMR State Monitoring Plans (SMP) and the sampling plans and coordinate State review.  3) Provide outreach support to the UCMR implementation effort.  4) Assisting with contacting public water systems (or States) regarding UCMR responsibilities and monitoring requirements.    5) Assist with oversight and coordination of the UCMR laboratory approval program.  6) Produce reports and analyses in furtherance of regulatory development activities.  7) Provide administrative support in the planning and execution of workshops, conferences or public meetings.  	 The resulting contract will include management of multiple, concurrent work assignments which will require long-term as well as quick turn-around responses essential to the statutory responsibilities of the Office of Water.    The proposed contract will have a base period consisting of 12 months with six options of 12 months each, for a total potential performance period of seven years.  The base period consists of a maximum amount of 14,050 (7,750 base effort plus 6,300 quantity option) direct labor hours.  Option Period 1 consists of a maximum amount of 26,600 (15,300 base effort plus 11,300 quantity option) direct labor hours.  Option Period 2 consists of a maximum amount of 25,800 (14,500 base effort plus 11,300 quantity option) direct labor hours.  Option Period 3 consists of a maximum amount of 25,800 (14,500 base effort plus 11,300 quantity option) direct labor hours. Option Period 4 consists of a maximum amount of 13,500 (7,700 base effort plus 5,800 quantity option) direct labor hours. Option Period 5 consists of a maximum amount of 19,100 (11,300 base effort plus 7,800 quantity option) direct labor hours.  Option Period 6 consists of a maximum amount of 19,100 (11,300 base effort plus 7,800 quantity option) direct labor hours. Total maximum level of effort for this seven year period of performance is 143,950 direct labor hours.  It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee/level of effort contract will result from this solicitation. The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and1552.209-72) requiring an offeror to certify that it is unaware of any potential Conflict of Interest or to disclose any potential Conflict of Interest of which it is aware will be a part of the solicitation.  The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to  make full disclosure of any actual or potential Conflict of Interest discovered after contract award will also be a part of the solicitation. The current projected start date of the contract is October 1, 2005.  This will afford a three month transition period for a new contractor.  The applicable NAICS code is 541611.  The solicitation will appear on the Internet under Solicitation Number PR-CI-05-10459.  It may be accessed through the EPA's home page on the World Wide Web (www.epa.gov). The direct link URL is  http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  All responsible sources who submit a proposal will be considered by the Agency.

<CONTACT>DAN M. NEUSTEDTER, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 919-541-4749, E-Mail: neustedter.dan@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a contract to design, build and install a Humidification, Heat Recovery and Reverse Osmosis Water Treatment System (HHRROWTS) for EPA facilities at Research Triangle Park, NC based upon drawings supplied with the solicitation. An Overview of the Existing Mechanical System is detailed in the Six (6) parts below: (1) The existing building is ventilated, humidified, dehumidified, heated and cooled by seven built-up air handling units located in the Penthouse Mechanical Equipment Room of Building A.  The air-handling units utilize 100 percent outdoor air and serve laboratories and animal holding areas.  Six of seven air handlers run concurrently and one is redundant. (2) The existing air-handling units utilize compressed air atomizing humidifiers located inside the air-handling units downstream of the heating coils.  (3) Existing chillers in the Central Utility Plant (CUP) cool the facility.  The backup is an air-cooled chiller. (4) Existing high temperature hot water boilers located in the CUP heat the facility.  The high temperature hot water is currently piped from the CUP to the existing unfired 80 PSI steam generators located in the first floor Mechanical Equipment Room in Building D. A backup 80 PSI Steam Boiler is located in the Tunnel Level Mechanical Equipment Room located in Building A. (5) Heating hot water which is supplied to the heating coils in the air-handling units is generated in heat exchanger served with 80 PSI steam. (6) The existing controls system is a TAC America utilizing direct digital control.  Computer, keyboard, CRT, and printer are located in the maintenance office for controlling and monitoring the system, including alarm reporting. An Overview of the New Mechanical System is detailed in the Three (3) parts below: (1) The outdoor air will be treated by a new sensible energy recovery system utilizing a new runaround coil loop, new pumps, and new heat recovery coils which will be installed into the existing air handling units and the built-up exhaust plenums also located in the Penthouse Mechanical Equipment Room in Building. (2) After passing over the new heat recovery coil in the existing air handling unit, the outdoor air will be humidified as required with a new low absorption distance (<24") low pressure steam manifold to achieve the space humidity requirements. (3) Existing VAV boxes with terminal heating coils will provide the necessary ventilation air quantities and supply air quantities with discharge temperature modulated by the terminal heating coils to satisfy individual thermal, moisture and ventilation requirements of each zone.  This requirement will be procured utilizing unrestricted, full and open competition procedures and, therefore, no set-asides will be used.  A firm-fixed price contract type is contemplated.  The base performance period is planned for about 5 months and this will probably include optional installation tasks; these options will not be for options periods but for optional tasks within the approximately 5 month base period. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) No. 333415 applies with a size standard of 750 employees. It is estimated that this solicitation will be issued around March 23, 2005 with proposals due approximately thirty (30) days after the issuance date.  It is anticipated that a site visit will be held at the EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC. within a few weeks after release of the solicitation.  Further information will be provided in the solicitation. The solicitation will be available solely through the EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd. Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available. All future information about this acquisition, including amendments (if any), will also be distributed solely through the EPA's web site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. Telephone and FAX requests will not be honored.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) intends to enter into a Sole Source 
agreement in accordance with FAR 13.106-1B of the Federal Acquisition Regulation
with Ms. Joan Haynesworth  to provide assistance with processing time sensitive Freedom of Information Act requests for PBGC records.  The Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of this action being deemed only one source reasonably available.
 
The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that has experience as a paralegal working within the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act requests received by PBGC.   
 
The basis for  this determination is that PBGC has a requirement for a contractor who maintains a consistent high level of production and attention to detail. This contractor will assure  that an extremely high level of accuracy is maintained at all stages of processing the request.  This position is to process date sensitive requests (statutory deadlines under both the FOIA and Privacy Act) involving production of PBGC records.
PBGC is receiving record numbers of requests from participants in recently trusteed plans.  In order to effectively process  this influx of requests PBGC needs someone with  knowledge and understanding of FOIA and Privacy Act involving production of PBGC records.
 
Ms. Haynesworth has over 20 years experience in other Federal Agencies as a paralegal working within the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act areas.  In the last year, as a PBGC contractor, she has become very familiar with PBGCs record systems and developed contacts throughout the agency that allow her to locate and collect documents and process FOIA request at a consistently high rate. Her familiarity with PBGC records will be invaluable in processing these time-sensitive requests and will help us deal with the anticipated demand. These unique capabilities are essential to this project. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting documentation to Flora Taylor  at the office identified above, by fax (202)326-4162  or by e-mail at (taylor.flora@pbgc.gov) which establishes that their specifications or qualifications meet PBGC's  requirement.   Documentation must be received within ten (10) days  after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by PBGC.   A determination by  PBGC not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Building & Fire Research Laboratory, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with TA Instruments of New Castle, DE, for an upgrade to an existing Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analyzer (DMTA).   

NIST's existing DMTA, the RSA II, has been used for research since 1995.  The purchase of the RSA III would allow existing databases to be manipulated and utilized and would also allow the use of five (5) material accessories previously purchased.  

Sole source determination is based on TA Instruments being the sole manufacturer and provider of the existing equipment, proprietary equipment required for the upgrade, and proprietary software necessary to utilize the equipment.  Furthermore, purchase of a different model DMTA would cause NIST to lose access to existing data, and require additional expenditures for accessories to be compatible with a different system.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by March 15, 2005, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The website to register for the B-52  Stand-off Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson  AFB on 16  17 Feb 2005 is located at the following address: www.usasymposium.com/b52h B-52H Standoff Jammer The B-52 Systems Squadron, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is preparing to issue a  Request for Proposal (RFP)for a Lead System Integrator for the pre-Systems  Design and Development (pre-SDD) phase of the B-52 Standoff Jammer (SOJ) Program.  This announcement is being posted to provide information about the  program to prospective bidders.  Questions may be submitted to the points of  contact listed at the bottom of this announcement.  We will update this  announcement by posting the questions and our responses in a Bidders Library  that will be placed at the end of this announcement.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and  regulations.  It has been determined that foreign companies will not be  permitted to participate in this acquisition at the prime contract level.   Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics  Services Center (DLSC) +http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/+ and have a legitimate  business purpose may participate in this solicitation. Contact the Defense  Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan  40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification  process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military  Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16   17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractors subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircrafts strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

<CONTACT>James Van Oss,937-904-4192
<DESC>UPDATE (3-9-05) CLARIFYING STATEMENTS TO ALL ESUP OFFERORS The following statements are posted to help clarify various aspects of the RFP,  including the fifth amendment, and the evaluation notice process: 1) The fifth amendments change to the MPQ does not represent any change to the  Governments requirement for the flexibility to upgrade the entire fleet of 509  aircraft.  The Government still requires pricing for the entire fleet of 509  aircraft.  The purpose of the MPQ was to provide the offerors with an  opportunity to adjust their prices, if necessary, to accommodate any changes in  the pricing assumptions or any other considerations associated with the MPQ. 2) Change/slip pages should be submitted only for the EN pages in which the  changes are enacted.  A re-submittal of an entire proposal volume is neither  necessary nor desired.  If a change cannot be made within the confines of the  current page(s), it is permissible to add a page numbered as an addendum to the  current page, i.e. page 213 would roll into 213A, 213B, etc.  The remainder of  the numbering in the volume would not be affected, nor would there be any  changes to the subsequent pages due to the addition of new material.   Electronic versions of change/slip pages resulting from an EN should be  submitted individually, i.e. as a file separate from the remainder of the  volume.  3) The page limitations were for the initial submittal of the proposals only.   As we are now in discussion, any changes resulting from evaluation notices will  not be counted against the original page limit.  Any additions to supporting  documentation that are necessary as the result of an evaluation notice are  acceptable.   4) The color of change/slip pages does not necessarily reflect the proposal  volume but the factor category.  The factor title, i.e. Mission Capability,  Contracts, Past Performance, etc., should match the color of the change/slip  pages provided in Amendment 5, regardless of the volume.  For example, Volume 5  may include both Contracting and Mission Capability colored change/slip pages. 5) Unless otherwise notified by the Government, the offerors response to the  EN will determine whether a narrative and/or change/slip page response is  appropriate.  In the event that the Government requires a specific type of  response, i.e., narrative rather than a change/slip page, the offeror will be  notified accordingly.   6) If a perceived error is found within an evaluation notice, the offeror may  correct the error and annotate the correction as such.  If the error impairs  the offerors ability to respond, the offeror should notify the PCO immediately  so that the error may be addressed. //END OF UPDATE//   UPDATE (3-1-05) FIFTH AMENDMENT TO T-38C ESUP RFP POSTED Changes to the T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program Final RFP have been posted  as Amendment 5.  The following is a summary of the major changes: 1) The pricing table in Exhibit PF is expanded to include updates to initial  submittal of data. 2) CDRLs 0007 and 0018 are revised. 3) The MPQ is changed from 509 to 199 to align the quantities with the current  approved funding stream.  See the amendment for additional details. 4) The evaluation of the small business subcontracting plan and small  disadvantaged business participation has been placed with the Systems  Engineering/Program Management subfactor in Section M to clarify where it will  be included in the evaluation.   5) Unit cost and quantities per shipset for energetics and time change out  items are requested.   6) Additional changes to Section L and M, and the SOO are made to request  additional information, clarify various aspects of the RFP, or re-align the  remainder of the RFP with the above changes. Every offeror is asked to verify receipt of the fifth amendment by filling out,  signing, and returning the attached form, Fifth_Amendment_Acknowledgment.doc,  at your earliest convenience, but no later than 12:00 pm EST on 4 March 2005.

Please fill out, sign, and return the attached form,  Amendment_Acknowledgement.doc, at your earliest convenience.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one or, preferably, both  of the contractual POCs listed below.  Please remember to begin any email  subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE UPDATE (1-20-05) FOURTH AMENDMENT TO ESUP FINAL RFP POSTED Changes to the T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program Final RFP have been posted  as Amendment 4.  No time extension is anticipated as a result of these  changes.  The following is a summary of the major changes: The following sentences were added to Section L, Paragraph 3.3.3 (a) and are  written in pink to distinguish them from previous amendments:  "The offeror may  provide a seat-cover to protect the identity of their seat.  Seats must not  include any visible markings/decals/data plates identifying its manufacturer;  these markings must be removed or covered prior to delivery." The following sentence was added to Pricing Exhibit PA: "The Government  anticipates a delivery date of 9 MARO for the Integration Testing Shipsets." Lastly, although it is not an amendment, the  ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc document has been corrected to more  accurately reflect the clauses that were changed.  Please note, this document  was provided for informational purposes only in an attempt to assist the  offerors.  In the event of a discrepancy between supporting documentation such  as this listing and the RFP, the RFP takes precedence.  The corrected document  has been reposted.   If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one or, preferably, both  of the contractual POC+s listed below.  Please remember to begin any email  subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (1-13-05) THIRD AMENDMENT TO ESUP FINAL RFP POSTED Changes to the T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program Final RFP have been posted  as Amendment 3.  The following is a summary of the major changes: 1)  Section K, AFMC 5352.215-9007 USE OF NON-GOVERNMENT ADVISORS (AFMC) (NOV  1998), the following list of firms supplying non-government advisors was added  to the clause: Anteon International Corporation ARINC Incorporated Camber Corporation General Dynamics Corporation MTC Technologies Sumaria Systems, Inc. 2)  Several changes were made to Section L.  Passages in green type represent  third amendment changes.  Red type still represents first amendment changes,  and blue type still represents second amendment changes.  Offerors should not  rely only upon the color coding system to identify changes;  all offerors are  responsible for adhering to all instructions provided in the original RFP and  all amendments.   The major changes to Section L are as follows: 1)  References to a "C" type contract with options were replaced with  appropriate IDIQ language.   2)  Additional instructions for the cross-reference matrices are provided in  Paragraph 2.1.5.8.   3)  Additional information regarding the packing procedure is provided under  Paragraph 3.3.1 (b) (6). 4)  It became apparent that it would be impractical to draw numbers at the time  of proposal receipt. Therefore, in the paragraph 3.3.3 (e), the following  sentence, "Offerors will draw a number at delivery of the proposal to determine  the sequence of the evaluation." is replaced with "Through random selection,  the Government will determine the order in which the seats will be evaluated.   Offerors will be provided an approximate date for the beginning of their seat  evaluation via email once Volume II - Past Performance of their proposal is  received."   5)  The following passage was added to paragraph 2.1.5.4 (g), "This restriction  does not apply to PDF files submitted for the Pedigree documentation.  For the  Pedigree documentation, PDF files with textual search and copy functions shall  be submitted to the maximum extent practicable.  However, in situations where  submitting an "image" is the only option available, it is acceptable to do  so."   If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one or, preferably, both  of the contractual POC+s listed below.  Please remember to begin any email  subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// Update (1-11-05) CONTRACT TYPE CHANGED TO IDIQ ON-LINE CERTIFICATIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS APPLICATION (ORCA) REQUIREMENT ADDED CLARIFICATION REGARDING PAST PERFORMANCE The Government has amended the RFP to change the contract type from a "C" type  contract to an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.   As these changes are essentially a restructuring of the pricing tables from  within the H clauses to Pricing Exhibits and a change in ordering procedures,  no RFP schedule changes are being made.  These changes are hereby posted as the  second amendment to the RFP.  In addition, the Government has enacted a few  other changes in order to comply with the new ORCA requirement that became  effective on 1 Jan 2005.   As a result, the following documents have been changed: 1)  The model contract 2)  Section K, Certifications and Representations 2)  Section L   The changes in the clauses in the model contract are listed in these two  documents, ESUP_Previous_Section_H_vs_Pricing_Exhibits.doc and  ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc.  Several exhibits, e.g. PA-PQ, have  been created to replace the majority of the H clauses, and are included in  the .pdf version of the model contract.  In addition, MS Excel versions of  the documents have been posted on PIXS in .zip file,  ESUP_IDIQ_Pricing_Exhibits.zip.  If you are unable to access the Excel files,  please contact one of the contractual POC+s listed below for assistance.     Offerors are asked to utilize the new tabular format for the pricing.  The  tables may need to be adjusted, changed to landscape mode, etc. to accommodate  your dollar values.  This is a perfectly acceptable approach.   The DD Form  1423+s, Exhibit A, include the changes from Amendment 1. Exhibit B is the list  of support equipment that originally appeared in SCR H-118.  The Statement of  Objectives, Attachment 1, has not been changed, but is serving as a placeholder  for the contractor proposed Statement of Work. A paragraph with information regarding ORCA has also been posted as  ORCA_Information.doc.  The clause added to Section K can be found within that  section and is referenced in the ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc  document. Section L has been posted in its entirety with all the Amendment 1 and  Amendment 2 changes incorporated.  Amendment 1 changes are in red; Amendment 2  changes are in blue.   Due to an ambiguity in the RFP regarding the Past Performance Questionnaires,  the Government would like to highlight a couple key passages from the original  RFP, and two key changes to the RFP document.   In paragraph 4.1.1 (b) (6),  Section L of the RFP states "All Past Performance Questionnaire Tracking  Records shall be submitted with the offeror+s proposal as an addendum to Volume  II.  This exchange/contact between the offeror and its POCs shall cease upon  submission of the offerors proposal to the Government in response to this  RFP."  In Attachment 4 to Section L, it states, "We are seeking at least two  POCs, per relevant contract, to submit a completed Present/Past Performance  Questionnaire directly to the Government no later than [OFFEROR FILL-IN RFP  CLOSING DATE (30th calendar day after RFP release)]."  Because these statements  do not provide a clear and unequivocal cutoff date for receipt of the Past  Performance questionnaires, the Government has amended these passages to remove  the ambiguities/discrepancies.  The due date for Past Performance  questionnaires is the RFP closing date of 31 Jan 2005 at 12:00 pm EST.  In  addition, the phone and fax numbers associated with submittal of these  documents has been changed to reflect the current location of the Government  POC.  Offerors may need to contact their potential  respondents to ensure that  the respondents have the correct phone and fax numbers.  Also, as was  previously mentioned, a list identifying respondents to Past Performance  Questionnaires will be provided to each respective offeror in the near future  to aid in your tracking of these responses.         If you have any questions or concerns regarding this amendment or any aspect of  the ESUP program, please contact one or both of the contractual POC+s listed  below.  Please remember to begin any email subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (1-5-05) PAST PERFORMANCE QUESTIONNAIRES All potential offerors are asked to provide a list of all the customers and  subcontractors+ customers expected to provide past performance questionnaires  for the ESUP source selection.  This will enable the Government to provide  timely feedback regarding any questions about receipt of these questionnaires  and will help us to provide a tally of the received questionnaires.  All  offerors are still responsible for ensuring that questionnaires are received  prior to the deadline. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one or, preferably, both  of the contractual POCs listed below.  Please remember to begin any email  subject line with "ESUP".

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS IS HEREBY BEING MODIFIED TO CHANGE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT:  BUILDING CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS HAVING A CONSTRUCTION COST LESS THAN $10,000,000.  ALL OTHER INFORMATION REMAINS UNCHANGED.

SOLICITATION FOR CONSTRUCTION MANAGER (CM) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract, General Services Administration, 1500 E. Bannister Road, Room 2135, Kansas City, Missouri  64131-3088.  Project Control Number RMO25551.  Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about March 16, 2005.  No document charge or deposit is required.  Request list of those received RFP no later than ten days before submittals are due.  The contract will cover the States of MO, KS, NE, and IA, but will have a primary geographic area.  Firms will generally receive work in the primary area, but may receive work in other parts of the four state region.  The primary geographical area is the City of Kansas City, which includes the Kansas City Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA), the city of Columbia, MO, and the portion of the State of Missouri west of Columbia, the State of Nebraska and the State of Kansas.  Project involves:  Building construction projects having a construction cost less than $10,000,000.  CM services may include (1) Pre-Design Services (design programming, developing management plans, schedules, budgets, and studies); (2) Design Phase Services (design review, cost estimate review schedules, cost control); (3) Construction Phase Services (inspection to assure contract compliance, daily logs, progress reports, write and negotiate change proposals on behalf of the Government, process contractor invoices); (4) Post Construction Phase Services (converting red-lined as-built drawings to CAD drawings): and (5) other related services as required.  Typical projects include initial space alterations for tenant agencies, replacing/adding building system components (switchgear, roofs, boilers, chillers, HVAC equipment, and low voltage monitoring & Control systems such as fire alarm), and parking lot improvements.  The majority of the projects will have estimated construction costs in the range from $50,000 to $2,000,000.  Additional similar projects may be added to the contract if mutually acceptable to the Government and the CM.  The minimum contract amount to be awarded per year is $2,000.  The maximum amount payable under this contract shall not exceed $1,000,000 per year or any exercised option periods.  The term of the contract is one year.  However, at the option of the Government and if the CM contractors performance is satisfactory, the contract may be extended for up to four additional one-year option periods.  The successful CM contractor, including its subsidiaries and affiliates, shall not be eligible for award of a contract for A-E or construction services for these projects, nor serve as a subcontractor or consultant to any A-E or construction contractor for these projects.  This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Because of the critical role of the CM, the Government intends to use the best value concept in selecting a CM.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating price and other factors specified in the solicitation; with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) contains the contract terms, scope of work and the proposal submittal requirements.  The RFP will be available o/a March 16, 2005.  Proposals shall be received in this office o/a April 19, 2005.  Specific date and time shall be specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Technical factors and price will be considered.  Technical evaluation factors, in relative order of importance, are (1) Qualifications of Organization; (2) Qualifications of Proposed Personnel; and (3) Management Plan.  The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factors, however, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  Joint venture or firm/consultant arrangement will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality service.  The proposed contract is 100% set-aside for small business concerns (see numbered note 1).  Applicable NAICS Code is 236220 and the size standard is $28.5 million 

The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.   It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.  Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address:  www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor's responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for any changes and/or conditions.  

The use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) is required in Federal solicitations as part of the bid submission process, thereby eliminating the need to submit a paper copy with each offer.  Please enter and maintain your representation and certification information via the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Once there you will find detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance under Help. To prepare for and register in ORCA you will need to have two items:  an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) as identified in the CCR record.

Statement of Work for
Centralized, Outsourced Mailroom and Imaging Services 
For the Department of Labor, 
Division of Federal Employees Compensation


1.	Introduction:  

The Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP/DFEC) administers the Federal Employees Compensation Act  (FECA).  FECA provides workers compensation coverage to three million Federal and Postal workers including wage replacement, medical and vocational rehabilitation benefits for work-related injury and occupational disease.  Compensation claims filed under the Federal Employee Compensation Act are processed by the Division of Federal Employees Compensation (DFEC) program.  

The process of adjudicating and managing these compensation claims requires Claims Examiners within DFEC District Offices to review a variety of documents that must be maintained as part of the case processing record of each claim.  These documents provide the supporting evidence of determinations regarding the admissibility of treatments, the amount of compensation to be granted, and other decisions related to the claim.  These case files, which can range in size from fewer than 20 pages to well over 1000, pose a significant paperwork management challenge for DFEC.

1.1	Purpose:

The purpose of the DFEC Mailroom and Imaging Outsourcing program is to establish a centralized mailroom and imaging capability that will achieve the following DFEC technical, management, cost, and risk mitigation objectives:

&#61692;	Improved mailroom, imaging, and data entry throughput and efficiency
&#61692;	Reduced mailroom, imaging, and data entry costs
&#61692;	Common workflow methodologies and process controls 
&#61692;	Established management and technical expertise
&#61692;	Common processing platform
&#61692;	Robust facility and equipment capacities in support of current and future requirements
&#61692;	Ready availability of back-up facilities, equipment and personnel
&#61692;	Established telecommunications capabilities
&#61692;	Implementation of uniform, established quality control procedure

2.	Requirements

The Contractor shall provide mailroom, scanning, and indexing services for Workers Compensation claim documents in accordance with the requirements stated herein.   

2.1	Tracking System

The Contractor shall maintain an automated system for inventory tracking and reporting of all program activities, as described in the following sections.  At a minimum, this system shall provide the following standard reports which shall be made available to OWCP/DFEC via secure Internet communications:

	Real-time batch status
	Backlog/Reconciliation Report
	Turnaround Report  Snapshot of batch status
	Quality Report
	Reject Report

These reports shall reflect real-time statistics relating to production and turnaround service levels.  Additionally, as an option, the Contractor shall provide customized ad hoc reports reflecting unique reporting requirements and make these available to DOL on-line.   The reports should also be available in summary and detail formats, and where possible be made available in a downloadable/importable format. 

2.2	Facility

Mailroom services shall be performed at the Contractors facility.  The Contractor shall provide a modern state of the art facility. The Contractor shall maintain at least two geographically distinct facilities capable of supporting the capacity requirements stated in Section 3.1 Below.  These facilities must possess similar imaging and processing equipment in order to support OWCP/DFEC/DFEC in the event of a disaster.

2.3	Mail/Document Processing

Contractor shall process all DFEC mail and transmit data to DOL/DFEC within 48 hours from receiving the mail into the facility. Exceptions listed in section 2.4 Out Sorting.

2.3.1	Receiving

The Contractor shall receive incoming mail via third party courier and USPS at this location and prepare for processing.  Contractor shall establish USPS PO BOX.  Incoming mail will be labeled with appropriate district office identification.
  
Mail in shipping bags shall be received at the Contractors shipping dock. Trays of envelopes and packages will be extracted from the shipping bags. Identifying information shall be collected for the tray and used for inventory control and tracking purposes.  Each tray will be entered into the Tracking System, which shall produce real time reports that will be available to authorized OWCP/DFEC personnel via a secure Internet Web site.

Mailroom personnel will process the postal trays and provide an envelope volume count for each tray which will be entered into the Tracking System with the appropriate tray identifying information and employee identifying information.

Contractor shall only process envelopes from returned mail. 

2.3.2	Document Preparation

Document separator sheets will be placed between each multi-paged document.  The Separator sheet bar code will be read by the scanner and will indicate the beginning of a new document for sequencing purposes.  

2.3.3	Sorting

The sorting process will commence with the removal of envelopes from the postal trays, extraction of the contents of each envelope, and entry of the employee and mail data into the Tracking System.    If a Case numbers is not present on the document, the Contractor Shall look up the appropriate case number and annotate it on the document, for later index entry.  OWCP/DFEC will provide an extract of their database, with daily updates, for Contractor use in looking up case numbers.  Two percent of the routine mail is anticipated to require case number lookup.  The documents and associated attachments will be prepared for imaging by removing staples, paper clips, repairing torn pages and performing other necessary document preparation functions.

Contractor shall sort mail by document type and District Office.

Sorted tray data shall be entered into the Tracking System to allow the production of real-time Internet reports detailing the total number of sorted trays, by document type.

Documents shall be sorted into the following categories:

Decisions	Nurse 
Fiscal 	Rehab 
Forms	Non-Scannables 
Incoming Correspondence 	
Medical & SOAF 	
Miscellaneous 	

2.3.4	Image capture

Contractor shall scan all documents and create images using standard TIFF Group IV format at 200 dpi.   

Contractor should be able to accept documents from other electronic sources including faxes and imaged files from Central Bill Contractor.

The scanner operators shall, at a minimum clean the scanner optics and paper transport at the beginning of each shift, as well as, at periodic intervals during each shift in order to maintain optimum image quality. At the beginning of each shift, scanner operators shall run the appropriate test target to verify image quality. The scanner will be calibrated at the beginning of each shift based on the results of the test target.  

The document imaging operators will feed the stack header sheets and associated documents within the stack through the scanners.  Scanners shall operate in duplex scanning mode with the threshold set to automate the deletion of blank pages.  As the documents are scanned, hard copy documents and images will be assigned a unique Document Control Number (DCN) as part of the index during the scanning process.  The DCN will be in a format acceptable to OWCP/DFEC and will be imprinted on the document pre-scan along with the case number.  Multi-page documents will contain the same DCN.  

As the documents are scanned, the corresponding images shall be electronically batched and transmitted to the production location for indexing. The Tracking System will be continuously updated with the location of each image. 

Upon completion of the document imaging process, the Tracking System shall produce real-time internet reports detailing the total number of documents scanned, by type, and by District Office.  The scanner operator shall delete batches that are not processed properly during capture.  An operator shall rescan these batches. 

The Contractor shall verify that the numbers of paper pages match the scanned pages.  Quality control personnel shall verify that images have been scanned correctly, blank pages have been dropped, and the image is viewable.  Poor quality source documents will be rescanned to improve quality and if quality does not improve pass a message in the description field indicating best scan possible.  These documents will be identified by DCN on the reject report.

2.4	Out Sorting

The following documents including all attachments shall labeled with receipt date and forwarded daily to the appropriate District Office Via overnight delivery service without further processing: 

Congressional Inquiries and forms CA1, CA2, CA2a, CA5, CA6, CA7, CA7a, CA7b, CA16.

The Contractor shall annotate the medical bills with the case number, remove the attachments, and label them with receipt date and forward daily to the appropriate Contractor via overnight delivery without further processing.  The Contractor shall perform case number look up to determine the appropriate district office.  If the case number is unavailable, the district office will be determined by the geographic location of the claimants address.  Attachments removed from the medical bills will have the case number annotated and sorted into the appropriate category for processing.

2.5	Quality Control (QC)

The Contractor shall provide random QC on at least 2% of all prepped batches.  Quality control personnel shall, at a minimum, verify that annotated case numbers are correct, the documents are in the correct category, that documents have been correctly separated between each document, that all fasteners have been removed, pages have been repaired as necessary, and the appropriate header sheet is on the batch.  When QC is complete, the batches will be returned for pick-up by the scan operator.   QC shall include a random check of envelopes to ensure that all mail has been extracted from envelopes. Results of the QC/QA check shall be documented in the appropriate report.
	
2.6	Indexing/Data Capture

All indexing shall be performed using Contractor systems, software and personnel and will result in the creation of an electronic data file formatted per OWCP/DFEC specifications.  

Images will be indexed by capturing the data elements outlined in Appendix A.  

All documents will contain the case number as the primary index data element. 

When the index operator keys the case number, the system shall display the claimant name from the case number/claimant name table.   The operator shall verify that the claimant name is correct by matching it against the imaged document. 

The index operator shall capture the author date from the imaged document.  

The category code shall be determined from the subject matter of the document.

The subject code is to be used only on rehab documents and for future use.

After the index entry is complete, the batch shall be routed to a different index operator for verification.  The index verifier shall validate that all data elements are correct.  The verifier will compare the data and enter the correct data.

Quality Control personnel shall perform a minimum quality control sampling of 2% of the daily volume.  Batches will be routed randomly to the quality control operators for quality checks after the verification process.  During the indexing process, Images that are identified as having poor quality due to the scan process shall be rejected and processed for rescan.    These documents will be identified by DCN on the reject report.

2.6.1	Accuracy Levels 

The Contractor shall maintain a minimum indexing accuracy level of 99.5% quality based on field.  

The Contractor shall perform verification of critical index fields.  The Contractor shall monitor each receipt date to assure that the required accuracy level is maintained.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement and a request for information only.  It is not a solicitation nor does it guarantee a solicitation will be issued.

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Joint Spectrum Center, is seeking sources that are capable of designing and evaluating protocols for wireless ad-hoc networks that enable efficient spectrum utilization while providing adequate Quality of Service (QoS) required for mission critical applications.

Recent advances reported in the literature outline a general framework for cross-layer optimization in wireless networks, which considers joint optimization of signal power levels, instantaneous data rates, routing, antenna weighting, and link scheduling, with network models that capture the network-wide interference of transmissions of each user/node.  Of particular interest is the development of advanced ad-hoc wireless protocols that intelligently manage the trade-offs between efficient spectrum utilization and Quality of Service.  Sources must be familiar with such recent advances and be able to concretely demonstrate how a cross-layer optimization framework can be applied to the joint design of protocols for routing, power control, and frequency spectrum allocation, within a framework of an accurate network model which captures network-wide interference.

Interested parties must submit/email a capabilities package (limited to 10 pages) to the following:  Joint Spectrum Center, Attn:  Franklin Wheeler, Jr., 2004 Turbot Landing, Annapolis, MD 21402-5064, 410-293-2354, franklin.wheeler@jsc.mil.  Capabilities packages should be submitted no later than 25 March 2005, 1:00 PM EST.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to purchase 300 5-gallon containers and 125 one-quart containers, Synthetic Lubricating Gear Box Oil, American Lubricants P/N SCH 75W and Mobil P/N 624, NSN: 9150-01-418-8738. These items are being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. The oil is used to lubricate the gear train assemblies which turn the radar antennas. Although, the Mobil part number is considered compatible, the NWS has determined and agreed upon by the NWS/Radar Operations Center, the NWS/National Reconditioning Center (NRC), and the gear train assemblies manufacturer that the use of another manufacturers product will not only cause damage to the gear train assemblies, but it is against good engineering practices to switch back and forth between two different lubricating oils. The oil shall be packaged in 5-gallon containers manufactured by Lab Safety Supply, P/N TL8218 (N) and in one-quart containers with absolutely no exceptions. As these items are in support of the current NEXRAD program, alternative or like items would not be acceptable. The government knows of only one source (A.J. Klein) who can provide and deliver these items as stated above. Any small business sources, able to provide the exact item as referenced herein is encouraged to respond to this announcement within 10 days after its publication.  Interested firms should submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and brief statement regarding its capability to provide the specified items. This information should be submitted by email to Karen.L.Christian@noaa.gov or may be faxed to telephone number 816-426-7530, ATTN: Karen L. Christian.

The AEA TTO team will be accepting white papers on potential AEA technologies and concepts during the period of 10 Mar 05 through 22 Apr 05.  White papers are encouraged to be unclassified and all intellectual property/proprietary information will be appropriately protected.  If papers are higher than unclassified, proper handling procedures will be conveyed at the Industry Day.  The white papers will serve as the basis for scheduling follow-up, descriptive presentations to the TTO in accordance with Industry Day guidance.  These technology briefings will be scheduled during multiple sessions in the primary period from 2 May to 17 Jun 05 and will be held at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH and the Washington DC area.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Dual Channel Radar Acquisition Subsystem for Doppler Weather Radar Application
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/ National Severe Storms Laboratory (NOAA/NSSL) to negotiate with Sigmet, Inc., located at Woodland Park, 2 Park Drive, Suite 1, Westford, Massachusetts for a Dual Channel Radar Data Acquisition Subsystem for Doppler Weather Radar Application.   BACKGROUND: In support of the National Weather Service (NWS), NSSL seeks to build an experimental transportable X-band radar and implement dual-polarization and Doppler capabilities to study effectiveness of small wavelength radars in observing weather phenomena.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The contract to be negotiated is for a 150 day performance period. SOLE SOURCE: NOAA/NSSL has determined that Sigmet, Inc. is the only contractor that can satisfy three existing requirements or constraints.  First, the system must provide a backup system for the existing Sigmet hardware in the research WSR-88D radar.  Because the WSR-88D radars were designed and built for the Government under design specifications, and they all are owned and operated by NWS, the radars contain unique hardware.  Sigmet hardware is used for the operation in the WSR-88D radar, and NWS is retrofitting the WSR-88D radar fleet with the Sigmet equipment.  It is imperative that NWS and NSSL retain backup equipment to avoid lengthy downtimes due to equipment malfunction during severe weather, and Sigmet is the only source of equipment that can serve as backup on the research WSR-88D radar.  Second, the data acquisition system must be compatible for portable X-band dual polarized Doppler weather radar.  This type radar also is not commercially available.  Therefore, NSSL must acquire the Sigmet data acquisition component and develop interface hardware and software to integrate it into the operational radar system, which, as just described, is unique to NWS and NSSL.  Third, the subsystem must provide a platform for rapid prototyping of experiments using an existing phased array Doppler radar that is used in the National Weather Radar Testbed.  The data acquisition system component of the phased array radar is not compatible with the WSR-88D radar.  However, the Sigmet equipment can be adapted for short-term use in research with these tools.  In addition, varying NSSLs research and test equipment from equipment used by the NWS would compromise the integrity of programs developed by NSSL and the compatibility and transferability of such programs with NWSs fleet of WSR-88D radars.  Accordingly, Sigmet is the only one responsible source for the data acquisition subsystem.  This is not a formal solicitation. This notice may represent the only notice. See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), intends to award multiple firm fixed price purchase orders to contractors quotations are determined to provide the best value to the government. Description:  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), the United States Department of Energy is required to develop a repository for the disposal of approximately 70,000 MTHM (metric tons of heavy metal) of radioactive waste in the form of commercial spent nuclear fuel (CSNF) and high-level radioactive waste (HLW).  DOEs OCRWM is responsible for the development of the repository and for the transportation of all designated CSNF and HLW from commercial utilities and DOE sites to the repository.  Upon receiving construction authorization from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the OCRWM will begin constructing a Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR) at Yucca Mountain on the Nevada Test Site (NTS) with operations scheduled to begin in 2010.  The MGR will be regulated in accordance with 10 CFR 63. Part of the national inventory of CSNF expected to be delivered to Yucca Mountain will have a thermal output that exceeds the current limit for immediate emplacement.  Consequently, CSNF that exceeds the thermal limit for emplacement will need to be aged at Yucca Mountain to allow its heat output to decay. The DOE is considering aging CSNF in currently licensed commercial vertical cask (casks may include canisters) systems and horizontal storage (aging) modules.  These casks and modules may require design modifications to satisfy Yucca Mountain site-specific requirements. These commercial systems are presently certified to 10 CFR Part 72.  A technical basis review is necessary to compare performance of casks licensed under 10 CFR 72 to Yucca Mountain site-specific hazards and their ability to comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 63.  This review shall include, but not be limited to, engineering calculations and analyses of criticality, shielding, structural, containment (per the 10 CFR 63.2 definition), and thermal performance of the currently licensed casks.  Also included shall be the results/consequences of any cask tip over or slap-down analysis. This scope of work contains information to be used to prepare a letter report that describes the adaptability of currently licensed casks for aging purposes. Minimum Mandatory Requirements:  DOE will only consider award to contractors who have successfully designed spent nuclear fuel storage casks in accordance to 10 CFR 72, and who have received Certificates of Compliance from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Questions/Comments:  Questions/comments must be received through the IIPS web site no later than March 15, 2005 .  Submission of quotations by means other IIPS is not authorized. Acquisition Procedures:  This acquisition will be conducted using SAP in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.

STATEMENT OF WORK : PURPOSE: To deliver a course teaching military capabilities for Intelligence Community analysts. BACKGROUND: In FY 99, the Defense Intelligence Agencys Directorate for Analysis and Production instituted a three-week, interactive course designed for intelligence analysts with little or no experience in analyzing the operations and capabilities of foreign military forces.  These training events are effectively blended into an understanding of joint operations during classroom instruction delivered by instructors from DIA, CIA, and NIMA.  Students are introduced to issues such as manning, equipping, training, and organization of foreign military forces. Students visit the National Ground Intelligence Center at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.  DIA and CIA jointly manage the course, with analysts participating from various Intelligence Community organizations. OBJECTIVE: To deliver three (3) three (3)-week iterations of the Interagency Military Analysis Course.  IMAC is focused on two primary objectives:  (1) through intense classroom work, briefings at the NGIC facility at Aberdeen Proving Ground, and field experiences at Antietem Battlefield, to gain an analytic understanding of the composition, equipment, organizations, and functions of foreign ground, air, and naval forces; warfighter missions, capabilities, and intelligence needs; and the concepts governing the joint employment and deployment of foreign armed forces; and (2) to create an environment of information sharing, team building, consensus building, and leadershipcritical skills to working in an intelligence combat support environment, especially during crisis situations in support of deployed forces.
SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: Level six security clearance is required. This course and training will contain information classified up to, and including TS/SCI. DELIVERABLES: The contractor shall plan, organize, and direct three (3) iterations of the IMAC course.  In doing so, the contractor shall: a.

Prior to each IMAC course iteration at a time specified by the Government, execute a one (1)-day classroom preparation session at a location in the Washington D.C. area specified by the Government.  The contractor will cover the course objectives, itinerary, travel and administrative details, required readings, and team assignments.  Purpose is to ensure the students are fully prepared to gain maximum benefit from IMAC. c. Prepare and present introductions to each training event composing the IMAC course.  Each introduction will specify the learning objective of the training event and expected military intelligence analytic understanding to be derived from each training event. d.	Develop each training event that composes the IMAC course. e. Coordinate instruction of individual training events during the IMAC Course by senior DIA military capabilities analysts. f. Compile and submit to DIA POC, within two (2) weeks after the end of each iteration, student-based after-action reports for each training event.  The reports should cover, in paragraph format, each student's comprehension of the missions, doctrine, organization, equipment, capabilities, and operational intelligence needs for each Service. DELIVERY SCHEDULE: All work conducted under this Statement of Work will be accomplished between date of contract award and 30 October 2005.  Course dates are 18 April  6 May 2005, 11- 29 July 2005, and 13 30 September 2005.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

NOTE:  The following questions and answers are provided for the benefit of potential offerors.  However, no answer is to be interpreted as a change to the solicitation, or as a qualifier of the solicitation.  The terms of the solicitation remain unchanged unless the solicitation is amended in writing.  


Question 1:  Must teaming arrangements (specifically prime/subcontractor relationship) be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to the submission of quotation?  What is required to satisfy this requirement?

Answer:  At time of submittal of offer, offeror must indicate that there is a proposed joint venture agreement and it must be presented to the SBA for approval prior to award. Evidence of that approval must be presented to the Government before award. 

Question 2: Do you anticipate the requirement returning to 8(a) set-aside status? 

Answer: Continue to watch FedBizzOps for further information regarding the follow-on contract. 

Question 3:  Is the historical workload data provided for the Satellite Multimedia Support Operations, man-hours per month, counted in addition to the historical workload data provided for Graphics Services?

Answer:  The satellite requirements are separate from the numerical graphics production quantities in the historical workload data.

Question 4: Are all Graphic products, both Graphic Services and Satellite Multimedia
Support Operations, counted within the Graphic historical workload data?

Answer:  See Answer to question 3.

Question 5: Since this acquisition has been an 8(a) contract in the past, how can it now be changed to Small Business?

Answer:  The SBA granted permission for the bridge/interim contract to be accomplished as a small business and not an 8(a) set aside.  This permission currently applies only to the bridge/interim contract.   The decision as to whether the successor contract will remain in the 8(a) program or whether it will be set aside for small  business rests with the SBA which is currently studying the issue. 

Question 6: The Synopsis/Solicitation - F2M3US5063A100 for Multimedia Services states
that the period of performance is from 1 April 2005 through 30 September 2005. There is no reference to Option Periods. Will there be Option Periods added to this Synopsis/Solicitation, or will a new Solicitation be announced for the period of performance after 30 September 2005. If there were no changes to the Synopsis/Solicitation - F2M3US5063A100 for Multimedia Services after 30 September 2005, we would be willing to provide additional prices for these Option Periods at your request. This would eliminate the need for re-solicitation of this contract within the next 3 months.

Answer:  This solicitation is for a bridge or interim contract to provide continuity of services until we can award a new contract with a basic and option years. As such, option periods will not be added or evaluated under this combined synopsis/solicitation as we intend to solicit and award a successor contract by 30 September 2005.     

Question 7:  Will you please provide the names and categories of the current employees
at the Multimedia Service Center for continuity of staffing so we may hire
most or all of the current staff members?

Answer:  As this is a service contract, our office does not maintain a record with this information. Further, only Texas Mgt Associates (TMA), the incumbent contractor, can authorize release. We recommend that you contact the current contractor, TMA, at 210 673-8422 to acquire that information.

Question 8:  May we have permission to contact current Multimedia Service Center
employees for evaluation of their performance and skills in order to hire
the best-qualified staff to meet the requirements of this solicitation

Answer:  Our office cannot authorize thisonly TMA can authorize this and only after duty hours. We recommend that employees be contacted after working hours or that you make arrangements with TMA to meet with its employees after hours. 


QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FROM SITE VISIT OF 9 MAR 2005

Question:  Will you extend deadline for Questions from 9 Mar 05 to 10 Mar 05.

Answer:  Yes. Deadline will be extended to Noon CST, 10 Mar 2005. It is hereby extended. 

Question:  Pertaining to Bldg 7362, Multimedia Arts Combat Camera Function Room  Is the whole building used for Combat Camera?

Answer:  Just this room; the Government occupies the rest of the building.

Question: Pertaining to BMT, Room 131-132, Curriculum Development Graphics Area  What is supported here?

Answer:  Please refer to the Statement of Work.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

As the U.S., Canada and Mexico continue to take advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), one of the most pressing concerns facing the three countries, in particular Mexico, is the strength and competitiveness of the trading block.  Mexico has recently suffered from lost manufacturing jobs to Asia and is searching for methods to regain its competitiveness.  One of Mexicos solutions to increasing competitiveness is to capitalize on its geographical proximity to the U.S.  offering more secure and efficient trade transportation networks with the U.S., and thus Canada.

To this end, on June 15, 2004, 22 public and private organizations met with Mexicos President Fox to sign a collaboration agreement to promote the development of multimodal corridors in Mexico.  The goal of this agreement was to increase economic competitiveness via the coordination of the connected parties responsible for the facilitation and development of logistic links within and outside Mexico.  In fact, this is a first within this vital sector.  The formal agreement entered into by all key public and private organizations is a notable commitment to improve the logistic chains.  As a result of this agreement, it is expected that renewed commitment in the sector will fuel growth in the coming years.  

The SCT has proposed the following tasks within their proposal:
1.	Analysis of the principal origins and destinations of cargo in Mexico
2.	Analysis of the existing multimodal infrastructure, equipment, and services in Mexico
3.	Analysis of the potential for the creation of new multimodal corridors in Mexico as well as the interconnection with external systems
4.	Analysis of the needs and requirements for new infrastructure, equipment, services, and facilities.
5.	Design a methodology for the evaluating and monitoring the function and operation of multimodal corridors
6.	Assess the socio-economic impact of the development of advanced multimodal corridors at regional, municipal, state, national and international levels of operation.

This definitional mission will refine the scope of work and terms of reference presented by the SCT for developing a master plan for multimodal corridors in Mexico.  The DM will evaluate the probability of project implementation and make recommendations to USTDA for funding.

 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.

USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

USTDA seeks to hire a Definitional Mission (DM) team to travel to Guatemala to investigate energy security and natural resources regulatory reform projects, for potential USTDA funding.  The DM will provide technical assistance to Guatemalas Ministry of Environment and Mining (MEM) and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) in two programs: 1) increasing trade capacity by developing the regulatory and investment environment for mineral and hydrocarbon resource development, and 2) information technology and regulatory reforms for reducing energy theft and smuggling.  Overall, the resulting technical assistance recommendations are designed to improve the business climate for domestic and foreign investments in the mining and hydrocarbon sectors within the CAFTA framework.

The Definitional Mission is focused on opening the investment climate for developing Guatemalas mineral and hydrocarbon markets.  Guatemala has large, yet undeveloped metallic and non-metallic resources, not to mention being the only Central American country that has a significant reserve of hydrocarbon fuels.  The development of these two sectors represents a great opportunity for economic growth in Guatemala, and a significant opportunity for foreign investment and trade.  The technical assistance will help the capacity within the government of Guatemala regulate the natural resource development industry and provide ongoing oversight of existing extractive operations.

The DM shall specifically investigate two separate (yet related) activities:

Natural Resource Regulatory Reform: Conduct a fact-finding investigation and perform technical review of a Dorey & Associates, LLC proposal on behalf of MEM for regulatory reforms and institutional development within the Guatemalan mining and hydrocarbon sector.  The proposed deliverables of this project would include recommendations for new regulatory reforms in the mining and hydrocarbon sector, new permitting documents and procedures, and training seminars/workshops to increase the institutional capacity of the MEM and MARN to ensure effective management of increased investment in the sectors.  The details of each of these proposed outcomes/deliverables is described in greater detail in the MEM proposal, which will be provided to the winning bidder.

Energy Security: Evaluate a request from the MEM and the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala to provide technical assistance to assist Guatemala in decreasing the negative impacts of current fuel smuggling and alteration.  In order to realize new commercial and investments flows, along with new conditions created by commercial instruments, there is a need to strengthen the capability of public institutions responsible for policy, regulation, oversight and compliance, to ensure that counter-competitive practices, disrespect towards property and tax evasion caused by smuggling and fuel alteration are eliminated.  The desired outcomes of this project include new legislation to regulate the operation of the hydrocarbon sector and the development of increased capabilities and tools within the MEM to monitor the quality and quantity of commercial fuels in the country.  These tools would include a variety of training and information technology solutions to better track and control fuel resources in the country.  It is also important to note that this activity will not be supporting any police or military activity, but rather a list of technological solutions to develop a better management and regulation of this important sector.

 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.
