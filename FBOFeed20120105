<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents the intent to modify services provided by&nbsp;Cahaba Government Benefit Administrators, LLC.&nbsp;under contract number HHSM-500-2009-M0004Z authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. This data shall be obtained from the latest filed 12-month cost report. As later cost reports are accepted during the year, MACs shall update the data in FISS within 5 business days of acceptance of the cost report (for those hospitals that have not yet attested and received their initial payment).</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC><p>PBGC: Financial Analyst &amp; Related Services <br />Agency: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</p>
<p>Synopsis</p>
<p>PBGC's Department of Insurance Supervision and Compliance (DISC) requires financial analyst services to support DISC's daily operations. PBGC requires that the work be performed on site at PBGC's headquarters. The background and a brief description of the work follows.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>PBGC is a federal agency that guarantees payment of private pension benefits when companies and pension plans fail. It protects some 44 million Americans in over 27,500 private defined benefit pension plans. The PBGC pays benefits using insurance premiums and assets and other recoveries from plans and their sponsors; it receives no taxpayer funds.</p>
<p>Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), plan sponsors and their controlled group members (loosely defined as parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies) are jointly and severally liable for making minimum required contributions to their pension plans. When a pension plan terminates, plan sponsors and controlled group members are liable to PBGC for the unfunded benefit liabilities (UBL) associated with the terminated plan. The UBL is the difference between the plan's assets and liabilities as determined on the date the plan is terminated.</p>
<p>DISC is the department within PBGC that monitors the activities of pension plan sponsors and their controlled group members to determine whether those activities pose a risk to their pension plans. When risks are identified, DISC takes steps to mitigate those risks. When pension plan termination is appropriate under sections 4041 or 4042 of ERISA, DISC prepares the analysis and other paperwork necessary to terminate the plans and then seeks to recover termination liabilities, including UBL, from the former plan sponsors and their controlled group members.</p>
<p>PBGC currently has a contract for financial analyst services that is in the last year of its five-year term. PBGC seeks to award a similar contract for another term of up to five years (base year, plus four option years). The contract will require the contractor to provide both financial analyst services and related services, to include supporting DISC's efforts to revise reports, processes, and procedures to better mitigate risk to existing pension plans and to maximize recoveries for terminated plans.</p>
<p>Brief Description of the Work Required</p>
<p>The work to be performed by the contractor will include -</p>
<p>&bull; Monitoring the activities of pension plan sponsors and their controlled group members <br />to identify and analyze risks</p>
<p>&bull; Supporting PBGC's staff in risk-mitigation activities</p>
<p>&bull; Documenting risk-mitigation activities, to include settlement agreements</p>
<p>&bull; Reviewing requests to voluntarily terminate pension plans under section 4041 of ERISA,<br />to include -</p>
<p>&bull; Obtaining additional detailed information from the plan sponsor and controlled group members necessary to analyze the request</p>
<p>&bull; Analyzing the plan sponsor's and controlled group members' financial situations to determine whether termination appears appropriate</p>
<p>&bull; Presenting recommendations to PBGC officials for review and approval</p>
<p>&bull; Documenting voluntary termination decisions</p>
<p>&bull; When PBGC determines that involuntary termination of a pension plan may be <br />appropriate under section 4042 of ERISA -</p>
<p>&bull; Obtaining detailed information from the plan sponsor and controlled group members necessary to analyze the proposed termination</p>
<p>&bull; Analyzing the plan sponsor's and controlled group members' financial situations to determine whether termination appears appropriate</p>
<p>&bull; Presenting recommendations to PBGC officials for review and approval</p>
<p>&bull; Documenting involuntary termination decisions</p>
<p>&bull; Assisting in recovering termination liabilities from former plan sponsors and controlled <br />group members under sections 4062, 4063, 4064, 4067, and 4068 of ERISA to include -</p>
<p>&bull; Drafting memoranda in support of recovery activities</p>
<p>&bull; Analyzing the former plan sponsor's and controlled group members' capacity to pay termination liabilities</p>
<p>&bull; Supporting negotiations</p>
<p>&bull; Documenting settlement decisions</p>
<p>&bull; Preparing lien memoranda for internal use</p>
<p>&bull; Supporting DISC's continuing efforts to enhance its reporting, processes, and procedures</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.&nbsp; The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Division of Veterinary Resources (DVR), intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract on a non-competitive, sole source basis to the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Michale E. Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research, Department of Veterinary Sciences, 650 Cool Water Drive, Bastrop, TX, 78602, for the purpose of providing long term maintenance for a colony of chimpanzees.&nbsp; The NIH, DVR, intends to award a cost reimbursement contract with a one-year base period plus four (4) successive one-year option periods. M.D. Anderson is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source) because of the below:
<p><br />The first two contracts for this requirement were awarded by full and open competition in September, 1988 and September, 1994 to the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.&nbsp; The solicitation to Contract 263-94-C-0028 was issued to ten (10) sources yet only one proposal was received which was from the incumbent Contractor.&nbsp; The previous contract was issued under Other than Full and Open Competition to the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Contract No. N02-OR-0-4021).&nbsp; In addition, the current contract was issued under Other than Full and Open Competition to the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Contract No. HHSN263200700021C).</p>
<p>As a result, the reasons for other than full and open competition include the need for continuity to maintain the chimpanzees assigned to this program. This includes the provision of housing and support facilities, daily care to include the provision of fresh food and water, proper sanitation, and assurance that the overall animal health needs are fully met.&nbsp; All aspects of the Contractor's animal care and use program, including the provision of trained professional and technical staff, insure that the animals are maintained in such a manner that supports their behavioral, cognitive, social, and emotional needs which are crucial to their well-being.</p>
<p>Social housing is the most critical element for maintaining normal, species-typical chimpanzee behavior.&nbsp; Stable, socially-housed colonies must be maintained without compromising the health and well-being of the animals. Establishing compatible social groups often takes years.&nbsp; The chimpanzees on this contract are members of compatible, stable social groups that have been together for five (5) to fifteen (15) years.&nbsp; As groups mature, behavior staffs must use innovative methods to maintain a stable integrated research colony. Disruption of the social structure would significantly result in undue stress with potential resultant disease, morbidity, or mortality resulting in loss of valuable research subjects and compromised experimental data.<br /><br />The Contractor has the ability to provide training, psychological enrichment, scientific support, and house chimpanzees in large, stable social groups in an indoor/outdoor environment.&nbsp; The Contractor is committed to promoting the psychological well-being of the chimpanzees through a comprehensive environmental enrichment program and a positive reinforcement training program.</p>

<ARCHDATE>01102012
<CONTACT>Christine Shockley 2156979459
<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to procure a LEICA Scanner Measurement System on a brand name basis for the Naval Foundry and Propeller Center (NFPC). 

The proposed procurement is being processed on an other than full and open competitive basis with LEICA Geosystem and authorized resellers pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(c), Brand Name. The proposed action will result in a firm fixed price purchase order. 

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within seven days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.
 A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, responses should be submitted in writing to NAVSUP FLC Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office, Attn: Christine Shockley, 700 Robbins Ave., Bldg. 2B, Philadelphia, PA 19111 or via e-mail to Christine.Shockley@navy.mil. Numbered Note 22 applies.  

Justification: The instant requirement is to acquire the exact same tracker and scanner system that was purchased in 2010 on a brand name basis.
 An identical system needs to be purchased to handle the increased workload. The new systems will eventually perform 90% of the NFPCs measurement scanning needs as the old method of measuring is phased out. 

Operational consistency with the system that was bought in 2010 is the Governments minimum requirement. The NFPC requires the same software, same software platform and same equipment to insure operational consistency and interchangeability with all computer data bases, procedures and instructions. Furthermore, this scanning system has met the technical requirements approved by NAVSEA. Many studies and investigations evaluating measurement technologies to replace the old method of measuring has been conducted and the 2008-2009 study confirmed that the LEICA system was a superior scanning system and approval from NAVSEA was obtained.
 
 
NFPC engineering department has spent hundreds of man-hours experimenting with and developing standardized operating procedures for this scanning system to support Navy propeller manufacturing at the NFPC. If another system was purchased, NAVSEA would have to: conduct another study and approve the equipment, staff would have to be trained on a second system, new procedures would have to be written and there would need to be a spare parts inventory for multiple scanning systems. Time is of the essence. Based on the capital investment, time, knowledge, experience and familiarity with the LEICA Geosystem Absolute Tracker Scanner System, it is imperative to purchase the LEICA Scanning System equipment and services.
 

The requirement will be solicited among authorized resellers. Competition is limited by the use of brand name.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Conference will be held at the General Alfred M. Gray Marine Corps Research Center auditorium located on base at 2040 Broadway Street, Quantico, VA 22134. The Program Manager has been tasked to deploy a modern E-911 capability at fourteen (14) United States Marine Corps (USMC) installations. This effort is being implemented as part of the Emergency Management Command and Coordination (EMC2) effort, which includes the Consolidated Emergency Response System (CERS), to upgrade current Marine Corps emergency dispatch and communications capabilities bringing them up-to-date with current civilian mutual aid partners. A Performance Work Statement defines the requirements for a turnkey Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) installation of an E-911 call taking system with the associated logging and recording system, associated system training, and service implementation coordination services using E-911 industry standards. The new system will require the incorporation of government-furnished Master Street Address Guide (MSAG) data to assist Local Exchange Carriers (LEC) in properly routing 911 calls and Telecommunications Management Systems (TMS) telephone number and other location information. The system will also require integration with a government provided Emergency Services IP (ESINet) routed network. <br />It is expected that a solicitation will be issued within a month after the Conference on an "Unrestricted" basis. The estimated period of performance is eighteen months. All interested parties are invited to participate. In order to get on base, a valid driver's license is required. For planning purposes, interested parties are requested to submit the names of their personnel who plan to attend along with title and phone number to the following email addresses: naomi.melendez@usmc.mil and MCSC_ISI@usmc.mil. Note: There is an "underscore" after the MCSC in that email address. Once the request is received, additional information such as the Performance Work Statement (PWS) will be emailed to the interested parties. The request shall provide at least two email addresses where the information can be sent. Questions regarding the PWS shall be emailed to the email addresses above by COB January 23, 2012.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This announcement constitutes an official Request For Information (RFI). This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications of vendors for acquisition entitled "Repair of B-1 Wing Lower Skin". Request only vendors respond that would be capable as a prime contractor.

The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations.
<p>This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation For Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.

<DESC>This is a SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business), that can provide the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), medical loss ratio auditing and examination services of national and regional health insurance issuers data and operations. The information from this market research will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. <br /><br />BACKGROUND <br /><br />The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), Pub. L. 111-148, was enacted on March 23, 2010; the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, Pub. L. 111-152, was enacted on March 30, 2010. Section 2718 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), as added by section 1001 of the Affordable Care Act, established medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements for health insurance issuers.
<p>Section 2718 of the PHS Act includes two provisions designed to achieve the objective of "bringing down the cost of health care coverage." The first is the establishment of greater transparency and accountability around the expenditures made by health insurance issuers. The law requires that issuers publicly report on major categories of spending of policyholder premium dollars, such as clinical services provided to enrollees and activities that will improve health care quality. The second provision is the establishment of minimum Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) standards for issuers, which are intended to help ensure policyholders receive value for their premium dollars. Issuers will provide rebates to enrollees when their spending for the benefit of policyholders on reimbursement for clinical services and quality improving activities, in relation to the premiums charged, is less than the MLR standards established by the statute. The rebate provisions of section 2718 are designed not just to provide value to policyholders, but also to create incentives for issuers to become more efficient in their operations. Section 2718 also contains provisions which allow for modifications to the standards under certain circumstances. To make informed decisions about definitions and methodologies for calculating MLRs, the Affordable Care Act directed the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to make recommendations to the Secretary, subject to certification by the Secretary.</p>
<p>An interim final regulation (IFR) to implement the MLR requirements was issued in December 2010 and became effective January 1, 2011. This regulation adopts and certifies in full all of the recommendations in the model regulation of the NAIC regarding MLRs. Publication was designed to implement section 2718(a) through (c) of the PHS Act:</p>
<p>&bull; Subpart A of the IFR implements the requirements for reporting the data to be considered in determining that ratio.</p>
<p>&bull; Subpart B of the IFR addresses the requirements for health insurance issuers (issuers) in the group and/or individual market, including grandfathered health plans, to provide an annual rebate to enrollees if the issuer's MLR fails to meet minimum requirements: generally, 85 percent in the large group market and 80 percent in the small group or individual market.</p>
<p>&bull; Subpart C of the IFR establishes a process and provides criteria for the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to determine whether application of the 80 percent MLR in the individual market in a State may destabilize that individual market.</p>
<p>&bull; Subparts D-F of the IFR address enforcement of the reporting and rebate requirements of section 2718(a) and (b).</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>CCIIO is seeking multiple small businesses to conduct agreed-upon procedures surrounding analysis, desk audit (reviews) and field examinations of issuers related to the MLR Interim Final Regulation. CCIIO's overall goal is to determine the availability of qualified and experienced contractors to:</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and determine the potential magnitude of MLR rebates that may be paid to subscribers as a result of issuers not meeting the MLR requirements for the respective markets they serve in each state;</p>
<p>&bull; Review, analyze and examine issuers at the holding company level for the appropriate allocation of expenses as they relate to MLR calculations and the reasonableness of each allocation;</p>
<p>&bull; Examine issuers for the accuracy of reported elements of the MLR calculation;</p>
<p>&bull; Assess company compliance with rebate calculation, payment and reporting in compliance with the IFR.</p>
<p>The contractors will provide a full range of statistical, analytical, examination and/or professional business services as required. They will also assess areas of strength and vulnerability in the management, administration, operation and monitoring of elements affecting MLR reporting and rebate calculations. Tasks to be performed, as outlined below, are to be performed in accordance with any CCIIO-provided handbooks, guidelines, requirements, practices and procedures in conjunction with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), as promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the NAIC Financial Examiner's Handbook.</p>
<p>TASKS TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>Potential small businesses must be capable of performing the following tasks:</p>
<p>The analysis and examination engagements must be conducted utilizing the Desk Analysis/Audit Manual and Field Examination Manual and related schedules, as provided by CMS. Examinations must be conducted in accordance with established NAIC financial examination practices in conjunction with generally accepted auditing standards. The goal is to perform an annual desk analysis (review) of all issuers' reported MLR data within 180 days of filing [but in no event later than 270 days] and to provide a summary analysis of each review. The goal of examinations is to validate reporting and compliance with the IFR as well as to document any year-over-year trends or differences among issuers.</p>
<p>Contractors will have a primary obligation to compile, test, analyze, review and manipulate issuers' MLR Data to determine compliance with the IFR. Tasks include performing, providing and interpreting analytics of various markets, companies, peers, industry, state and holding companies, as directed by CMS and providing a summary of findings. Contractors will also undertake an Impact Analysis on potential public policy issues as determined by CMS. Contractors will be obligated to review and examine the data elements of the MLR calculation for compliance with the IFR, including but not limited to all the data elements on the Supplemental Health Care Exhibit (SHCE) ) and all the data elements on any forms to be developed and utilized by CMS. Contractors must evaluate the reasonability of allocations across company and product lines (including product lines not subject to the MLR IFR) and report their findings in a form and manner acceptable to CMS. Contractors must utilize any related non-IFR filings that may be required by the various States or Federal regulatory agencies to cross-check data for validity.</p>
<p>CCIIO will require that each Field Examination of a multi-State company or holding company and its related Report of Findings be conducted and reported by a Certified Financial Examiner (CFE) who is a member in good standing of the Society of Financial Examiners and that all work papers be reviewed and signed off on by a CFE. Contractor personnel (and any independent contractors) should be certified professionals within the insurance regulatory industry (i.e. SOFE (CFE) (AFE), with strong statutory/regulatory and insurance financial reporting background).</p>
<p>The Managing Director (or proposed similar position with the required expertise) (CPA or CFE) must have sufficient experience and expertise to know how to apply proper audit techniques and procedures to analyze, review and utilize the MLR data, Desk Audit and Field Examination Handbooks and any related guidelines for the oversight of their personnel and in the performance of the tasks for CCIIO. The Managing Director (or proposed similar position with the required expertise) must have achieved sufficient breadth of perspective to determine properly whether all material considerations have been addressed within the scope of the examinations and regarding any analysis. Other technical experts and support staff may also be used in the review process if and as necessary. Tasks associated with the performance of analysis or examinations should be limited to the lowest but most appropriate pay grade first and reviews of the work should be undertaken by the fewest number of supervisors or managers. Further, field and in-person meeting assignments should also be based on geographical proximity to the issuer being examined or people being interviewed and meetings should be conducted telephonically where feasible.</p>
<p>Each contractor should have a sufficient number of staff (including independent contractors) to meet the required staffing standards of the NAIC regarding the performance of multi-state and single-state company analysis and examinations, as applicable. For example, this may include: one Managing Director (CFE); one Field Manager (CFE); a minimum of three Sr. Examiner/Analysts (CFE/AFE); a minimum of three Examiner/Analysts (AFE); and, an actuary who is available during examinations on an as-needed basis (this information is supplied for informational purposes only).</p>
<p>The contractor's Managing Director (or proposed similar position with the required expertise) must be readily available to answer questions from staff and CCIIO. If at any time the Field Manager (or proposed similar position with the required expertise) is absent, an alternate Manager with the proper delegation of authority and expertise must available.</p>
<p>The MLR IFR requires issuers to submit to CMS a report concerning premium revenues and expenses related to the group and individual health insurance coverage that they issued. For the majority of issuers, the first MLR reports subject to the IRF must be submitted to CMS by June 1, 2012. An issuer must provide a rebate to enrollees in plans issued if the MLR is less than the percentage for the market as determined in accordance with the IFR. Rebates must be issued no later than August 1 following the end of the MLR reporting year. The first rebates must be issued by August 1, 2012.</p>
<p>Calculation of the MLR is based on a number of factors as set forth in the IFR, and may be modified by a credibility adjustment, depending on the number of life-years covered by the issuer. Miscalculation of the MLR may result in an issuer not paying a rebate to its enrollees where one is due. It is important, therefore, that the contractors understand the various elements and factors that go into the calculation in order to perform an analysis of the data that is reported. It is also important that the contractors understand and have knowledge of healthcare insurance and operations, policies, and state insurance regulations in order to perform analytics and identify trends and anomalies by lines of business and by state.</p>
<p>Due to the sensitive nature of the data to be reported and analyzed, conflicts of interests are a concern for the MLR audit program. For the purpose of identifying conflicts of interest, a conflict exists with a business concern or its affiliate (as that term is explained in FAR 19.101) if the business concern or affiliate is engaged or affiliated with, another entity that is involved with the determination, analysis or review of an MLR calculation for any issuer subject to the MLR IFR. The contractor will have to demonstrate that its performance of the services set forth in the Statement of Work will not directly or indirectly result in any potential conflicts of interest. The contractor will also have to disclose all current clients that are licensed health and life insurance carriers issuing fully-insured comprehensive major medical products in the individual and group health insurance markets.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT INFORMATION</p>
<p>Interested parties must demonstrate that they possess the knowledge and experience (gained within the last three years) to fulfill points (A) through (I) shown below. If a teaming relationship is proposed, the prime small business must effectively demonstrate the capability to effectively manage and coordinate this relationship in order to seamlessly fulfill (without disruption) project tasks. Small businesses and 8(a) concerns must be in compliance with the restrictions on subcontracting contained in FAR 52.219-14 entitled "Limitations on Subcontracting."</p>
<p>(A) Conduct analysis and examination engagements utilizing the Desk Analysis/Audit Manual, Field Examination Manual and related schedules as provided by CCIIO. Such examinations shall be conducted in accordance with established NAIC financial examination practices in conjunction with generally accepted audit standards. The goal is to perform an annual desk analysis of all issuers' reported MLR data within 180 days of filing and to provide a summary analysis of each review. The goal of the examinations is to validate reporting and compliance with the IFR as well as to document year-over-year trends or differences among issuers.</p>
<p>(B) Compile, test, analyze and review the issuers' MLR data to determine compliance with the IFR.

<DESC><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-11-160 entitled, "Early Markers of Alzeheimer's Disease in BLSA Participants: Structural and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Functional Brain Changes"<br /><br /></strong><br />This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541712.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">The BLSA was initiated in 1958 and is a multi-disciplinary study of physiologic and psychologic aspects of normal aging in community-dwelling men and women. Active BLSA participants are volunteers who visit the Clinical Unit of the NIA-IRP in Baltimore, Maryland for testing every 1 to 4 years. Since 1994, we have been conducting a longitudinal brain imaging study of selected older adults in the BLSA to characterize individual differences in longitudinal brain changes, investigate the extent to which these brain changes underlie individual differences in cognitive aging, identify brain changes that may be predictors of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, and assess the impact of potential modulators of brain and cognitive aging. As of August 5, 2011, 1486 neuroimaging evaluations, including 210 PET-PiB scans, have been performed. As part of this research program, it has also been necessary to develop and validate sophisticated tools for analysis of longitudinal neuroimaging data that can be applied in large-scale studies. More than 150 publications have resulted from the work of the initial phases of this project.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">Although image acquisition techniques have been refined over the initial contract period, the challenges and expense to conducting and quantifying longitudinal imaging data remain. While recent studies indicate that structural and functional longitudinal changes in specific temporal lobe regions predict cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, data based on the prior contract have shown that using networks of information throughout the brain provide greater sensitivity and specificity to predict who is likely to develop cognitive impairment and dementia and who is likely to remain healthy. BLSA imaging and autopsy studies also show that about 30% of individuals with considerable pathology in their brains remain healthy. Thus, a gap remains in our understanding of the temporal sequence of brain and cognitive changes in healthy aging and disease. The proposed contract will continue to fill this gap in our knowledge about the neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic underpinnings of cognitive and other functional changes and their temporal sequence in aging men and women by maximizing the number of repeated assessments with more recently introduced PET measures of brain amyloid deposition.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">In addition to continued analysis of volumetric MRI studies of brain aging, this contract will continue to perform in vivo measurement of vascular changes and amyloid deposition through continued acquisition of PET CBF scans and PET amyloid imaging using 11C PiB. Recent evidence indicates possible synergistic effects of vascular changes and Alzheimer's pathology on the development of dementia. As approximately half of the current sample aged 55 and older is enrolled in the BLSA autopsy program, in vivo imaging changes will continue to be validated against neuropathological findings. The proposed contract will also include analysis of more recently acquired BLSA MR scans, including younger individuals, collected at the NIA 3T facility to provide information on structural brain changes throughout the adult lifespan. Through the use of the existing physical and psychological data for BLSA participants, this project will provide unique insights into our understanding of predictors and the temporal sequence of individual differences in the rate of neuroanatomic, neurophysiologic and cognitive aging.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</strong></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">The purpose of the overall program is to enhance our understanding of physical and psychological changes in health and disease. Through the use of the existing physical and psychological data for BLSA participants, this project will provide unique insights into our understanding of predictors of individual differences in the rate of neuroanatomic, neurophysiologic and cognitive aging and the temporal dynamics of these changes. This neuroimaging data will provide important normative data, including the frequency and extent of brain abnormalities in community-dwelling individuals, from which to evaluate pathological aging. In addition, this project will provide critical information on accelerated brain and cognitive changes associated with cognitive impairment and the predictors of cognitive decline and cognitive resilience.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement (SSA) to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications relative to NAICS code 541380 ? Testing Laboratories (size standard of $12.0M).  EPA requests demonstration of capability by interested small business firms through submittal of a capability statement.
In addition to the SSA, EPA requests all interested parties (whether submitting a capability statement or not) to add their company information to the ?Interested Vendors List? tab associated with this notice on FedBizOpps.
DISCLAIMER
This is NOT a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought announcement only.  Responses to this SSA shall not constitute responses to a solicitation.  As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this SSA are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely the Government's discretion.  This SSA is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any government assessments.  The information received will be utilized to assist in formulating a strategy for competitive procurements.
DESCRIPTION
The EPA Superfund Program has historically relied on the Regional EPA Laboratories including the Environmental Services Assistance Team (ESAT) to provide non-routine analytical services in support of Agency hazardous waste site projects, and other environmental monitoring.  Although primarily a Superfund vehicle, ESAT also supports the Agency's RCRA program and other non-Superfund analytical efforts.  These contractors provide multidisciplinary technical teams to each Region within their respective areas.  The teams perform chemical and biological analysis, Field Analytical Support Program activities, specialized analytical services support and data validation/data review support, review of site-specific quality assurance, site investigation and sampling plans support for the development of new analytical methods, and logistical and administrative functions.
Currently, EPA administers 10 ESAT support contracts (one in each EPA Region).  The currentESAT contract structure was developed to expand EPA's existing capabilities for providinghazardous waste sample analysis and related support to Superfund sites.  Because of the need for both routine and specialized non-routine analytical services, and the emphasis on environmental data quality assurance under a mandatory EPA Quality System, EPA sought to fully optimize the use of the Government?s available resources by having ESAT contractors perform services onsite at EPA Regional Laboratory facilities at the locations listed below:
Region / 	LocationRegion 1 / North Chelmsford, MARegion 2 / Edison, NJRegion 3 / Ft. Meade, MDRegion 4 / Athens, GARegion 5 / Chicago, ILRegion 6 / Houston, TXRegion 7 / Kansas City, KSRegion 8 / Golden, CORegion 9 / Richmond, CARegion 10 / Port Orchard, WA
The Government anticipates a single contract award in each Region (i.e. 10 total contract awards) to fulfill this requirement for up to 8 years.  The level of effort required on an annual basis under the proposed contracts is anticipated to fluctuate based on many independent factors including amount of laboratory analytical work required in each EPA region, programmatic budget changes, and changes in agency priorities.  The Government anticipates a need for the following broadly estimated levels of effort (LOE) per contract year in terms of direct labor hours by the ESAT contractor in each of the EPA Regions:
Region / Estimated LOE (hours) per contract yearRegion 1 / 25,000Region 2 / 36,000Region 3 / 25,000Region 4 / 60,000Region 5 / 17,000Region 6 / 16,000Region 7 / 21,000Region 8 / 50,000Region 9 / 46,000Region 10 / 22,000
PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
A draft ESAT Support contract Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached.
CAPABILITY STATEMENT
The Government requests demonstration of capability by small business firms interested in performing this requirement as a prime contractor through submittal of a capability statement.  All capability statements shall:
1. Include company name, address, DUNS, phone and principal owners including partners, subcontractors and/or joint venture arrangements.2. Include business classification(s): (Small business, 8(a), HUBZone, small disadvantaged business [SDB], service-disabled veteran-owned small business [SDVOSB], women-owned small business [WOSB], and economically disadvantaged women-owned small business [EDWOSB]) in your submission.3.

<a href="mailto:Heath.Brad@epa.gov">Brad Heath</a>
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Water, Engineering and Analysis Division requires contractor support to provide environmental engineering support for clean water regulations.  This environmental engineering support is expected to include professional program managers, engineers, scientists, technicians and administrative services with experience in Clean Water Act (CWA) regulations, industrial wastewater treatment and monitoring and pollution prevention technologies.  
The Clean Water Act directs the EPA to develop technology based regulations limiting the release of contaminants from industrial processes to the nation?s waterways. These national technology based regulations, called effluent limitations guidelines, pretreatment standards and new source performance standards apply to existing and new industrial processes that release water directly to surface waters (direct dischargers) as well as to facilities that release water to municipal waste water treatment plants (indirect dischargers). Effluent limitations guidelines, pretreatment standards and new source performance standards are implemented and are enforceable through National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits issued to industrial facilities.   
The purpose of this announcement is to identify potential small businesses with the capability to perform all or a portion of the requirements defined in the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and to further determine whether or not all or aportion of the work can be set-aside for potential small businesses sources. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $7 Million. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on environmental issues, such as the control of environmental contamination from pollutants, toxic substances and hazardous materials. These establishments identify problems, measure and evaluate risks and recommend solutions. They employ a multidisciplined staff of scientists, engineers, and other technicians with expertise in areas, such as air and water quality, asbestos contamination, remediation and environmental law.
The majority of the technical support that the contractor shall be tasked with for clean water regulations may include the following industries:
?   conventional and unconventional oil and gas extraction, ?   energy production, ?   seafood processing, ?   centralized wastewater treatment, ?   municipal wastewater treatment, ?   ore mining activities, ?   organic chemicals, plastics and synthetic fibers,?   inorganic chemicals manufacturing,?   along with reviewing previously regulated and unregulated industries.
All interested parties are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than fifteen (15) pages on standard 8.5? by 11? paper.  The Government shall evaluate each capability statement based on the interested party?s demonstrated qualifications, capabilities, expertise, experience and past performance in each of the areas included in the draft PWS.  Interested parties shall describe their ability to provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment and facilities in support of the efforts required by the PWS.  The proposed contract shall have a five year ordering period.  It is anticipated that a single award Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract shall result from the subsequent solicitation.
Interested parties shall provide their size status for NAICS code 541620, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hubzone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern. 
Due to the nature of the PWS requirements, it is anticipated that interested parties with the expertise to perform this work could also have relationships (e.g. a parent/subsidiary/sister company affiliation or an existing contractual relationship), which presents the potential for significant organizational conflicts of interest.  It is the EPA?s contention that a significant organizational conflict of interest would exist if award were to be made to firm within the following groups:
?   firms within the regulated community that discharge processed water, provide treatment of wastewater or drinking water;
 ?   firms that manufacture/sell/import water treatment chemicals and/or equipment (including point-of-use/point-of-entry devices;
?   firms that provide advisory and/or technical services relating to waste minimization, waste management, and wastewater treatment and control for the regulated industries;
?   firms that act in consulting, advisory, or legal capacity with, or for, firms trying to overturn or circumvent the regulations which are the intended outcome of this contract;
?   firms that own or operate community water systems.
Firms that are directly included in the entities described above would have clear conflicts which would be difficult for the agency to avoid, mitigate or neutralize.  However, some consulting firms that may have affiliates or subsidiaries that are part of those entities could, with proper disclosure and appropriate action, avoid, mitigate, and neutralize the potential conflict of interest.  Likewise, firms that have business or financial interests in those entities may also present actual or potential conflicts of interest concerns, which with proper disclosure and appropriate action may be avoided, mitigated, or neutralized.  None of these firms are restricted from submitting a capability statement to indicate interest in this upcoming solicitation.  
EPA reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested party in any manner EPA determines is appropriate, including, but not limited to, the creation of a competitive solicitation. An interested party shall avoid including any classified, business confidential, and/or proprietary information in its response. However, if an interested party shall submit such information, the information shall be clearly marked accordingly, and the interested party shall provide sufficient justification as to why such information is business confidential and/or proprietary. EPA shall review said information and safeguard it accordingly.  The Government shall not pay for any information that is provided in response to this announcement, nor shall it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.
Responses to the above should be submitted to Brad Heath, USEPA, 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268-0001, or via e-mail to heath.brad@epa.gov no later than January 24, 2012.  A separate synopsis shall be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting from this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice.  It is NOT a solicitation for proposals.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this notice, and will NOT reimburse any cost incurred in response to this notice.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 621498 with a size standard of $10.0 million (USD).

This sources sought notice is being issued to determine if there are small businesses capable of, and interested in, providing the required services.  Responses from interested, capable and experienced small business firms will assist the VA in making a set-aside decision for this procurement.  Relevant experience would be a project where the company BOTH established and operated a Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) for primary care and mental health services.  Payments under the contemplated contract would be made on a capitated-rate basis.  The company awarded the contract will be required to have a fully operation clinic up and running on or before the 90th day after award.  

Set-up activities include, but are not limited to: 
1) leasing adequate space
2) furnishing the space with adequate office furniture
3) equipping the space with adequate office, computer and medical equipment
4) providing physicians and other health care providers with the requisite licenses, credentials, certifications, etc.
5) working with the VA to connect to the VA computer network
6) ensuring that the clinic will be compliant with all relevant VA and JCAHO regulations from the first day of operation

Operational activities include, but are not limited to, handling all operational activities of a primary care and mental health clinic, and using the VA Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) to enter all information related to patient care.  The contractor would provide primary care and mental health services in a clinic environment, solely to veterans who primarily reside in Rockingham, Albemarle, Augusta and Greene counties of Virginia, and Harrisonburg City, VA.  The new clinic must be located within a 5 mile radius of the current clinic location (847 Cantrell Ave, Suite 100; Harrisonburg, VA).  It is anticipated that in its first year of operation, the Harrisonburg CBOC will have approximately 3,545 veteran enrollees.

The contractor operated CBOC must have the necessary facilities, professional medical staff, diagnostic testing and treatment capability, and referral arrangements needed to ensure continuity of health care.  Primary Care services include longitudinal outpatient medical care for the purposes of prevention and detection of disease and subsequent management of medical conditions, for veterans deemed eligible.  The contractor will also be responsible for documenting care provided using CPRS.  The care will be provided by primary care providers who must be either family practitioners or general internists or their authorized designees.  Furthermore, the physician providers must be Board Certified/Board Eligible and licensed to practice in the state of Virginia.  The proposed CBOC, at a minimum, shall provide one standard of care that must be consistent, safe and of high quality.  Additionally, the proposed CBOC is expected to comply with all relevant VA policies and procedures, including those related to quality, patient safety and performance.  The care provided by the CBOC should be patient centered, continuous, accessible, coordinated, and consistent with VA Medical Center standards, including the thirteen service standards detailed in VHA Directive 2006-041, "Veterans Health Care Service Standards," dated 6/27/06 (http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=1443).  Finally, the VA Office of Patient Care Services, Primary Care Program Office, is undertaking a new initiative to implement a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model at all Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Primary Care sites which is referred to as Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT).  This initiative supports the VHA Universal Health Care Services Plan to redesign VHA healthcare delivery through increasing access, coordination, communication, and continuity of care.  PACT provides accessible, coordinated, comprehensive, patient-centered care, and is managed by primary care providers with the active involvement of other clinical and non-clinical staff.  PACT allows patients to have a more active role in their health care and is associated with increased quality improvement, patient satisfaction, and a decrease in hospital costs due to fewer hospital visits and readmissions.  Additional information on PACT can be found here: http://www.va.gov/primarycare/pcmh/).

Interested parties shall respond no later than close of business on January 19, 2012, and shall provide the following information:

1) Name of business and company contact information
2) DUNS number
3) Description of specific projects where your firm BOTH established and operated a primary care outpatient clinic in the United States.  Only list those projects where your firm handled BOTH the establishment and the operation of the clinic.  List the dates of operation for each project that meets BOTH criteria. 
4) PROVIDE REFERENCES FOR PROJECTS WHERE YOUR FIRM HAS BOTH ESTABLISHED AND OPERATED A PRIMARY CARE CLINIC. 

If a formal solicitation is issued, it is anticipated that the award date of any resultant contract would be on or about June 4, 2012.  The contract period of performance would consist of a one-year base period, and four 1-year option periods.  

NOTE: Key personnel will be listed in the contract. No substitutions of key personnel will be allowed for the first 90 days.  Any substitutions thereafter must be approved in advance by the VA Chief of Staff for the Martinsburg, WV VA Medical Center.

<p>The 21st CCLC program is authorized under Title IV, Part B, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended. The 21st CCLC is designed to create community learning centers that provide academic enrichment opportunities for children, particularly students who attend high-poverty and low-performing schools, to meet State and local student standards in core academic subjects, to offer students a broad array of enrichment activities that can complement their regular academic programs, and to offer literacy and other educational services to the families of participating children.</p>

<p>National Academy of Sciences (NAS) conducted a study on Early Childhood and Mathematics.

Young children, particularly those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, would benefit greatly from adult support and guidance for it would foster rich learning environment, particularly mathematics. As a result, there is a need to develop an early childhood toolkit focusing on mathematics learning providing better guidance for optimal learning outcomes.</p>
<p>To accomplish this purpose, the Department plans to, with the guidance of an officially appointed oversight committee, acting as a technical working group composed of NRC study group experts, representatives of the afterschool community, and STEM education experts, the NRC will work with partners from the 21st CCLC Afterschool community to develop a set of resources related to the NRC consensus study. In addition, the NRC will develop and implement a strategy for disseminating the tool kit and related materials so that practitioners have enough knowledge and support to implement effective strategies for mathematics learning in young children.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), with Aviat Networks, 5200 Great America Parkway, Santa Clara, CA 95054, under RFQ396919. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p><br />This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 811213, Communication Equipment Repair and Maintenance; the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>The FBI Microwave Radio Systems were manufactured by and purchased from Harris Stratex (currently Aviat Networks). The warranty for these systems expired, and the FBI anticipates normal, ongoing repairs for fielded systems operating 24 hours daily, 365 days per year. Aviat will perform normal repairs for fielded systems. The microwave radios and module repairs include parts and labor knowledge proprietary to Aviat.</p>
<p>Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement for the required parts and services can only be provided by Aviat, as no other vendor is capable of providing the proprietary parts and labor knowledge necessary to replace and/or service the Microwave Radio Systems as they were manufactured by and purchased from Aviat (formerly Harris Stratex).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office no later than January 10, 2012, 10:00 am Eastern Standard Time (EST), by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov . Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>FBI owned Motorola mobile and portable radios require repairs and upgrades. The upgrades are required on a recommended schedule by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Motorola will repair FBI owned Motorola mobile and portable radios and provide upgrades as the OEM requires.</p>
<p>Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement for the referenced services can only be provided by Motorola, Inc. In order to maintain the warranty agreement for the originally procured equipment, having services rendered by any other company would void the present warranty agreement and subject the government to potentially unwarranted additional expenses. The existing land mobile radio (LMR) infrastructure, manufactured and built by Motorola, employs a unique encoding design proprietary to Motorola. The FBI uses Motorola equipment spanning several generations for its radio system communications that subsequently requires hybrid components also unique to the LMR infrastructure.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS MODIFICATION WILL BE PROCURED ON A NON-COMPETITIVE BASIS UNDER AN EXISTING INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY CONTRACT FOR PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR THE NIST CENTER FOR NEUTRON RESEARCH (NCNR).
<p>This notice is issued in accordance with the guidance for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p>
<p>Contract Number SB1341-07-CQ-0016, Task Order Number 10478was awarded to Merrick and Company of Aurora, CO on September 23, 2010, in the amount of $4,663,448.08.</p>
<p>Description of Services<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/NCNR reactor is equipped with a thermal shield. This radiation shield consists of steel and lead that has to be water cooled in order to be kept at a temperature where it does not change shape under its own weight. Over the many years of usage the thermal shield plumbing has developed tiny leaks, which are impossible to repair.</p>
<p>Work under this task order requires the fabrication of, <br />installation of and training for the upgrade of the thermal shield plumbing system whereby the cooling water is administered by moving it through the shield using a vacuum rather than a positive pump pressure as in the present mechanical configuration.</p>
<p>The task order was awarded on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii).</p>
<p>Modification 0003 will be executed to incorporate design changes into the task order that resulted from the installation of the thermal shied, modify the payment schedule to include the payment for completion of the design changes, extend the period of performance, and increase the total value of the task order. Modification 0003 is not being funded using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds.</p>
<p>Design changes include:<br />-Heat Exchanger Connections<br />-Sparge Blower Inlet<br />-Modification to Blower VFD Installation<br />-Compressed Air Re-routing<br />-Water Management<br />-Alarm Wiring in C-100 RIO cabinets<br />-Additional Bracing<br />-Alarm Timer<br />-Default Setting Button<br />-Addition of a By-pass/Vent line to the rings header system; and<br />-Additional Bracing and Riser Configuration.<br /><br />Pursuant to this modification, the total firm fixed price of the task order will be increased by $35,128.80 from $4,706,304.52 to $4,741,433.33. The period of performance will be extended through February 15, 2012.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy the agency requirements.  The Government intends to issue a non-competitive modification to Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. under Contract N00189-08-D-0022. When ordered by issuance of individual Task Orders (TOs), the Contractor shall provide readiness and metrics support to the Fleet Readiness Enterprise (FRE), Naval Aviation (NAE), Surface Warfare (SWE), Undersea (USE), Naval NETWAR/FORCEnet (NNFE), and Naval Expeditionary Combat (NECE) enterprises.  The enterprises are composed around specific warfighting domains and their primary providers, working across existing stovepipes, or functional commands, to ensure ability to meet the warfighting mission at the lowest possible cost.
  The primary goal of the enterprise construct is to optimize existing resources and management of all elements of cost in order to achieve required levels of current readiness, save operating funds to re-capitalize the future Navy, and optimize the ability of the enterprise to deliver future capability on schedule and at or below cost.  To maximize Enterprise performance, the five key attributes of an Enterprise must exist:  (1) defined outputs; (2) process perspective; (3) transparency of all elements to see and react to each other in a timely manner; (4) metrics linked and driving the right behavior to achieve Enterprise results; and (5) discipline to have rigorous accountability for actions.
  Top level processes in enterprise management include, for example, current readiness, supply chain management; future capability, acquisition and procurement; both current and future total force requirements; and enterprise financial management and metrics.

<RESPDATE>012012
<CONTACT>Donna Cornish, Phone 3017634514, Email donna.cornish@census.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, based on the need for continuity. The Census Bureau intends to solicit and negotiate with James E. Steed, 37 Devereaux Terrace CT, Falling Waters, WV for expert consultation advice and program management assistance in planning and implementing programs and systems associated with facilities management, disaster recovery and continuity of operations for the Bowie Computer Center (BCC). It is critically important to maintain continuity of ongoing initiative, projects and other efforts, many of which are time-critical, in order to avert interruptions, delays, duplicative work, relearning, and excessive costs.
<p><br />The specific tasks shall include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>a. Directly assist the Division Chief and others as assigned, in matters pertaining to disaster recovery, facilities management, and other associated topics for the Administrative Customer and Services Division (ACSD).</p>
<p>b. Based on an in-depth knowledge of the Census organization and individual experience and expertise, provide expert advice and assistance in the planning, implementation, and operation of facility projects, including new initiatives to determine impact on facilities management and disaster recovery activities.</p>
<p>c. Provide independent review and evaluation services on administrative and operational issues deemed to require such attention by the Chief, ACSD. Represent the Division Chief in providing support for the BCC upgrades/replacement operations to ensure that all Census concerns are integrated into the planning and scheduling phases.</p>
<p>d. Review and evaluate administrative and facility operations as directed by the Division Chief and make recommendations for streamlining, improvement, problem solution, efficiency gains, as appropriate.</p>
<p>e. Design and prepare materials and presentations, as desired by the Chief, ACSD.</p>
<p>f. Provide on-going, expert consultation concerning the mission, direction and operations of the facility management programs at the BCC, with emphasis on, but not limited to, facilities management and disaster recovery business and continuity issues.</p>
<p>g. Attend and/or lead meetings involving the above efforts.</p>
<p>h. As directed by the COTR, brief Government representatives or provide written reports on an "as required" basis as to the status of Contractor's efforts.</p>
<p>For the past five years, the Census Bureau has obtained these services from James Steed who has demonstrated the ability to satisfy the Bureau's needs as described above. James Steed's specific expertise and knowledge of the BCC's electrical and mechanical infrastructure design and operation; knowledge of the BCC data center operational requirements; knowledge of the program area requirements, and his disaster recovery/contingency certification support this requirement. The Census Bureau believes that the success of this work is dependent on James Steed's continued involvement because any other source would necessitate extensive relearning, duplication of effort, unacceptable delays, and excessive costs, and would jeopardize the BCC's ability to meet its strategic goals. The intended contract will have a performance period of eight (8) months.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency, only if received by the closing date and time of this notice. A determination by the Census Bureau not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Census Bureau.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.<br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br /><br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<DESC>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Part A &amp; B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain a A/B MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS.
<p>The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of health care services, both institutional and professional, for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program's legal, policy, and operating environment is complex, and the Contractor will utilize or interact with certain CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will coordinate its activities not only with the CMS, but also with a broad range of agencies (at the federal, state, and local levels of government), other CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders within the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction and will perform standard or required editing on these claims to determine whether the claims are complete and should be paid. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also will enroll new providers; conduct redeterminations on appeals of claims; operate a Provider Customer Service Program (PCSP) that educates providers about the Medicare program and responds to provider telephone and written inquiries; respond to complex inquiries from Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs); and make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of different provider services, such as enrolling new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers on Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction L- Previously Jurisdiction 12 (comprised of the states of Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.) on or about January 4, 2012. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is February 23, 2012 with an anticipated award date of August 20, 2012.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<p class="MsoTitle"><span>Statement of Work</span></p>
<p class="MsoTitle"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The NOAA Science Advisory Board (SAB) is the &ldquo;only Federal Advisory Committee responsible for advising the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and NOAA Administrator (http://www.sab.noaa.gov).&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>SAB advice helps ensure high quality science programs, strategic research, and resource management in NOAA.<span>&nbsp; </span>Due to the breadth of scope of advice the SAB is asked to provide to NOAA, the SAB convenes Working Groups to provide specific expertise on certain topics.<span>&nbsp; </span>For topics of long-term importance to NOAA the SAB has standing Working Groups, including an Ecosystem Science and Management Working Group (ESMWG).<span>&nbsp; </span>The ESMWG provides &ldquo;scientific advice and broad direction to the NOAA SAB regarding NOAA&rsquo;s ecosystem related programs, in the context of national and international activities,&rdquo; and on &ldquo;NOAA&rsquo;s progress related to: regionalization, integrated ecosystem assessments, ecosystem science and monitoring, and organization issues (<a href="http://www.sab.noaa.gov/Working_Groups/standing/docs/2008/ESMWG_TOR_FINAL.pdf)">http://www.sab.noaa.gov/Working_Groups/standing/docs/2008/ESMWG_TOR_FINAL.pdf)</a>.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>Recent issues studied by the ESMWG include Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning, Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management, and Transformative Research.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The ESMWG is composed of 10-12 distinguished scientists with expertise in ecosystem related disciplines.<span>&nbsp; </span>ESMWG members generously devote time to ESMWG related activities outside of their primary jobs and within already very busy schedules. The ESMWG meets three times a year and meets by teleconference in between in person meetings.<span>&nbsp; </span>Depending on their current topics and deadlines extensive work is sometimes required in between meetings.<span>&nbsp; </span>As such, the ESMWG requires dedicated and directed staff assistance to manage the group and facilitate and develop meeting agendas, promote discussion and resolution of action items during and in-between meetings, coordinate and organize meeting and conference call logistics, confer regularly with NMFS, OAR, and NOS staff to keep up to date on ESMWG relevant issues, and to confer regularly with the ESMWG co-chairs.<span>&nbsp; </span>A NMFS contractor is required to help with the above as relates to the upcoming Spring 2012 meeting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Commercial Fishing Vessel and Fishery Observer Safety</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Commercial fishing is consistently one of the most dangerous occupations in the United States due to hazardous working conditions including, among other reasons, adverse weather, vessel disasters, dangerous gear operations, and a working environment that can cause fatigue.<span>&nbsp; </span>Commercial fishing fatalities have been gradually declining since the early 1990s, in part attributed to the Commercial Fishing Industry Safety Act of 1988, which required that fishing vessels have and maintain basic safety and survival equipment on board, complete safety training.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, despite recent improvements to fishing vessel safety, fishing fatalities and accidents remain.<span>&nbsp; </span>Since 1992 the U.S. Coast Guard has offered voluntary Dockside Safety Exams in an effort to make fishing vessels safer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Commercial fishing vessels (CFVs) that successfully pass this exam are given a safety decal, which is then valid for 2 years.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NMFS deploys fishery observers to collect data on fish catch and bycatch from federal commercial fishing vessels and fishing processing vessels.<span>&nbsp; </span>Currently fishery observers are required to monitor 42 different fisheries.<span>&nbsp; </span>The National Observer Program (NOP), housed in the NMFS Office of Science and Technology, provides a formal mechanism for NMFS to address issues of national importance to fishery observers including development of national policy related to observer health and safety.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 2004 NMFS and the U.S. Coast Guard signed a Memorandum of Agreement on Observer Safety (MoA) to aid in the implementation of the NOAA Fisheries Observer Health and Safety Regulations (50 CFR Part 600.725 and 600.746), which required that CFVs have a valid U.S. Coast Guard safety decal before taking an observer on-board.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 2010, a group of Worcester Polytechnic Institute students, in collaboration with the U.S. Coast Guard and NMFS, reported on the effectiveness of this MoA in the U.S. Coast Guard Districts 1 and 5 (within the NMFS Northeast region) as relates to commercial fishing vessel fatalities, casualties, observer pre-vessel safety check lists, and at-sea boardings.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their results showed significantly fewer fatalities and casualties on commercial fishing vessels with valid safety decals.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2011, the NOP, with U.S. Coast Guard support, decided to expand the analysis of CFV fatalities and casualties to a national scope.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition to looking at CFV fatalities and casualties by NMFS region and safety decal status, the analysis includes fishery specific data, complements of National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH).<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Results will be written up in a report and will be useful in further determining if the MoA has increased safety at sea and in informing future safety efforts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NMFS contractor support is needed to complete this report, communicate and coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard and NIOSH, in collaboration with the NOP, regarding any data questions or data requests, communicate with regional Observer Programs, and to present results at the February 2012 National Observer Program Advisory Team Meeting in Panama City, Florida.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates the Dredge Goetz in the upper reaches of the Mississippi River. The dredge is of a hydraulic cutter suction configuration with a 22 inch suction and 20 inch discharge pipe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The dredge is 225 feet long by 39 feet wide with an operating draft of 5 feet. The dredge power system is diesel-electric.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The primary diesel generating plant produces a total of 4,000 installed horsepower at 1,200 rpm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each generator is capable in producing 1,300 KVA at an 80% continuous duty cycle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Essential AC motors are controlled by means of variable frequency AC drive (VFD) components.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The swing drive manufacturer is Alstom, model number MV3000. The dredge has swing winches installed on the port and starboard sides. The two winches are employed to swing the head of the dredge back and forth across the river, allowing the cutterhead and main dredge pump suction to break up and clear away material from the river bottom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While in operation one winch is hauling and the opposite is paying out cable under variable hold-back tension, with both cables being connected to external anchors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The paying-out cable is kept taut by dynamic braking through the winch gearing and VFD programming, preventing a slack cable situation. An operator controls the winches through console-mounted joystick controls which provide the means to regulate the speed at which the dredge swings back and forth and the degree of hold-back tension on the winch that is paying out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once the dredge completes a swing from one side of the river to the other the swing process is reversed. The operator has the discretion to independently operate either the port and/or the starboard winch for other specific tasks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The dredge operates 24 hours per day 7 days per week for about 6 to 8 months per year. During a 24 hour period, the swing winches typically log between 10 and 11 hours of running time. The remainder of the period the dredge is not swinging. Swing rates vary depending on the amount and hardness of the material being dredged. In hard material with a digging depth of several feet the swing speed (and drum speed) may be as low as 5 feet per minute at the maximum torque available from the drive. In light material with shallow cuts the swing speed will range up to 80 feet per minute at the maximum torque available from the drive. </span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The dredge was manufactured in 2005 and has been in service since that date. The two swing winches supplied with the dredge were manufactured by the IHC Company of Holland. The gear reducers in the winches were manufactured by the C. Kraaijeveld B.V. Company of Holland. The manufacturer's type designation is KA.15.E.TR. The following information is offered to provide a description of the gearbox:</span></p>

Loose fits were also observed between gears and shafts. Fits were corrected and the lubricant was changed to ISO 320 with molybdenum for the third and fourth work seasons. Maximum torque available to the gear reducer was reduced and the maximum rate of change of speed was decreased by changing VFD settings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pitting has continued to develop at a lower rate. Replacement of the winches has been scheduled to avoid a gear reducer failure during the work season. </span></p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-7112<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p>52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have ( ), have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>REJECTION OF QUOTATION: Failure of interested parties to demonstrate compliance with the requirements above will be cause to reject the quotation without further discussions.</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The following will be used to evaluate quotations. The Coast Guard will evaluate quotations and make an offer resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quotation conforms to the solicitation and is determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the lowest evaluated technical price of quotations meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. Quotations will only be considered from Cherry Aerospace authorized distributors and should include evidence of being an authorized distributor. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Nov 2011) <br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

In response to this inquiry, ATNS hereby provides the following clarification:
<p><br />"As ATNS will assess the recommendations of the study and draft the technical specifications and/or requirements for any future system and/or service that may be recommended, we feel that there is no material benefit that any party will have over competing bidders (as it would be open tenders) should he have been involved in the prior processes. <strong>We therefore have no objection to companies bidding on both processes</strong>."</p>

<DESC><p>The Air Force is seeking sources for a potential 100 percent set-aside for 8(a) Region V, HUBZone, Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB), or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISTION MAY BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. This is a sources sought for planning purposes only. This effort includes one project: (Project 090156), Install HTHW Lines S-57 to F/10296. Project scope includes replacement of steam heat system from underground steam distribution lines with gas-fired boiler heating systems for Bldgs 879, 867, 278, 256, 1403, 293, 295 and 296. Remove overhead steam lines at Bldgs 278 and 867. The heating system components are assumed to contain asbestos containing insulating materials. Also included is the replacement of the steam heating coil inside the air handling units inside the facilities listed above, with a new hot water heating coil, along with the installation of a new HTHW to heating hot water heat exchanger, hot water pump, and new DDC controls.</p>
<p>Special requirements/concerns related to this project: <br />Steam distribution systems require specialized construction skills and safety preparations. Standard facility construction experience is not sufficient. Construction timelines are very tight since these repairs cannot be started until after the steam heating system is turned off, and must be completed in time for activation in the fall for this critical utility system. Numerous facilities will not have heat until this project is completed. Work will need to be carefully coordinated with the Mechanical Shop to minimize impact to mission. Project also includes HVAC and asbestos work.</p>
<p>The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 180 day period of performance.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 238220 Size Standard: $14M.</p>
<p>Prime contractors who are 8(a) Region V, HUBZone, EDWOSB, or SDVOSB and who intend to submit a bid for this solicitation are highly encouraged to submit the following by 10:00 a.m. (local Dayton time) on 16 January 2012:</p>
<p>Responses should include the following: <br />(1) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a Prime Contractor; <br />(2) date of HUBZone certification; and/or<br />(3) documentation of SDVOSB status; and/or<br />(4) 8(a) certification; and/or<br />(5) listing of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact with their phone numbers, and an explanation of the relevancy of the project; <br />(6) documentation from surety or their agent of your capability to be bonded for bid, performance and payment bonds for this project;<br />(7) If you are a HUBZone considering a joint venture that has not been formalized, you will need to specify the firm(s) you intend to partner with and how you plan to officially form the joint venture. <br />(8) If you are a EDWOSB, submit documents verifying eligibility at the time of initial offer to the WOSB Program Repository. You must provide access to the WOSB Program Repository to: <br />James L. Bane (James.Bane@wpafb.af.mil),<br />Jamien Johnson (Jamien.Johnson@wpafb.af.mil)<br />Keith Morris (Keith.Morris@wpafb.af.mil)</p>
<p>Firms interested should provide the above documentation. Fax or e-mail responses will be accepted. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested 8(a) Region V, HUBZone, EDWOSB, or SDVOSB concerns. Responses shall be limited to 5 pages. Please include your DUNS Number or CAGE Code on your response.

(U) Introduction<br />(U) This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice (FAR 15.201(e)). In accordance with FAR 52.215-3 - Requests for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997), the Government will not pay for any information/items submitted in response to this RFI. Any data provided will not be returned. This RFI does not commit the Government to award a contract. No determination as to the viability of this requirement has been made at this point and there is currently no solicitation for this effort. Any solicitation resulting from this RFI will be announced separately.<br /><br />B. (U) Background<br />(U) NGA ingests large volumes of geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) data to include raster and vector types transmitted via a variety of protocols. Given that, NGA, would like to understand technologies, that are currently available or in development, that can be used to efficiently ingest large data files, and provide protection capabilities against digital image-based malware.<br />(U) NGA uses various applications/systems to interface with the received data. The data must conform to stringent GEOINT standards. Any proposed process or technology must maintain these standards in the post-processed products. NGA will verify that any processing does not degrade the processed image or file.<br />(U) NGA is interested in information from Industry, Academia, and those within the Intelligence Community on approaches to mitigate any inherent risk that comes with ingesting GEOINT data. Some of those risks or threats identified via open sources include, but are not limited to: viruses, trojans, worms, insertion, altering, hiding, digital image-based steganography, and tracking. NGA is also interested in technologies or designs which can be developed or adapted to support ingest of a wide variety of file formats including imagery files.<br />(U) NGA encourages thoughtful, complete and innovative solutions to the questions in Section D. If interested parties are unable to respond to the entire RFI, NGA will accept responses to specific individual questions.<br />NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE AGENCY<br />7500 GEOINT Drive<br />Springfield, VA 22150<br /><br />C.

2.0	BACKGROUND
The purpose of the long range ocular interrupter (LROI) is to provide the Navy the capability to deliver a bright beam of light that produces a dazzling or glare effect on a closing target to warn and/or suppress potential threats through increasing levels of visual degradation.  The LROI will provide a controlled, high-intensity light beam at two levels.  A lower level will facilitate visual warning, and a second, higher level will provide temporary visual suppression.
  The LROI will deliver the correct irradiance to affect a targeted individuals vision, providing a clear, unambiguous warning at a distance of 3,000 meters (approximately 3,300 yards, or 1.6 nautical miles), an increased range over previous systems.  At a minimum, this extended range capability will provide increased tactical decision-making time to facilitate structured escalation of force (EoF) tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) across a broad range of military operations (ROMO).  Further, the LROI system enhances Joint Force operations in assessing the intent of personnel and controlling a potential threat as early as possible.
3.0	PURPOSE
The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 4.
 Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the Government is interested in information defined in paragraph 4 and the attachments.

4.0	CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT
Currently LROI is in a pre-Milestone A acquisition phase.  Although individual underlying technologies associated with LROI are considered mature, the integration and control of each into a cohesive non-lethal capability is new.  As such, NSWCDD is canvassing industry to assist in identification of readily available commercial based solutions that have proven field trials and/or prototype testing focused in the areas of magnifying optics detection, environmental adaptation, and automated variable power attenuation.
  In support of the technology development, the Government plans on working with industry in a collaborative basis to explore technology advancements and alternatives to aid in accelerating maturation of system and subsystem capabilities needed to satisfy LROI design attributes and operational requirements. 
The goal of this collaborative strategy and the information collected through this RFI is to assess commercial investment and the maturity of enabling technologies/capabilities in support of LROI development.  Currently, an LROI-type system is being scoped to meet expeditionary mission requirements.  The following outlines the scope of information sought and maturity of commercial-based solutions presented by the vendor.
Technology Focus Areas:
Focused technology development efforts will take into consideration suitable commercially-available technological approaches and solutions to further maturate the following areas being considered as LROI system functions.
  Based on current market analysis and preliminary technical readiness evaluation, the following four (4) focus areas have been identified for this RFI.  LROI functional characteristics, performance and capability attributes are provided in Attachment 1.  This attachment will enable the vendor to provide information that is relevant to the request.
1.	Magnifying Optics Detection
Currently, LROI is assessing the functionality to provide eye-safe operation, and to limit any permanent injury to operators, targeted individuals, or incidental non-combatants. One system attribute that requires definition for any non-lethal weapon is the acceptable risk of significant injury (RSI) to the contact or target of interest (COI/TOI).
  The most significant source of injury comes from the possibility of eye damage due to an individuals use of magnifying direct view optics (such as a rifle scope, spotting scope, or binoculars) within the LROI systems beam.  In such a case, the beam would become highly focused through the optics, potentially causing permanent eye damage to the COI/TOI. The vendor information provided would assist in defining a realistic RSI parameter and approaches to adapt or include a system capability to detect magnifying optical devices within the projected beam.
2.	Environmental Adaptation
Most non-lethal weapons have been fielded only for short-range applications.  LROI, as a long-range capability, requires additional levels of beam control to guarantee the intended effects of warning and suppression on the COI/TOI.
  Irradiance on COI/TOI can be reduced due to environmental conditions such as humidity, airborne particulates, or atmospheric refraction. Information about these conditions may be used to dynamically adjust beam irradiance to overcome atmospheric effects.   Current commercially available technologies may be used to measure these conditions; however, these technologies only provide accurate environmental information local to the point of origin (source) and cannot provide acceptable measurements along the path to remote targets (COI/TOIs).  This RFI requests vendor information applicable to this focus area to provide specific means to enable LROI to reliably and effectively deliver the desired non-lethal effects at extended ranges given variable maritime environmental conditions.
  In particular, the Government requests information on available technologies that can provide a lateral atmospheric sounding capability to determine attenuation and other beam effects over the distance between the LROI and the COI/TOI.  
3.	Automated Variable Power Attenuation
In order to ensure safe operations, including avoidance of unintended consequences, beam control must provide the means to adjust irradiance on target in order to achieve the desired effects while ensuring a low risk of significant injury.  Implementation will require a high degree of control to ensure appropriate personnel safety while maintaining performance.  This RFI seeks innovative vendor approaches and capabilities to provide necessary control measures and mechanisms to provide automated sensing, control, and adjustment of the beams irradiance to the COI/TOI within the anticipated range of LROI, and to detect and react to the occurrence of beam interruptions by objects other than the COI/TOI.
4.	Expeditionary Configured Power Sources
Expeditionary power is focused on providing a reliable source of power for LROI that is compatible with the expeditionary warfare operating environment while maintaining environmental and system safety requirements.
  Vendor information provided in response to this RFI should focus on identifying lightweight, small footprint, high power density, and expeditionary environmentally survivable power sources that can be utilized and adapted.
Collaboration in a Laboratory/ Range Environment:
Laboratory testing and range demonstration events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with Government developmental and operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and available solutions may support or present a potential to be adapted to satisfy LROI functional requirements.  This testing environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government and industry to promote the identification of emerging and mature technologies and to assess potential solutions to expeditionary missions and capabilities.
  Industry participation in test and demonstration activities does not suggest or imply that the Government will procure or purchase equipment.
Technology shall be at Technology Readiness Level 4 (TRL-4) or greater for the purpose of selection to be invited for laboratory testing or range demonstration.
Assess Industry Manufacturing/Production Capacity and Organic (US) Sourcing:
Vendor information provided to this RFI should cover state-of-the-art manufacturing, assembly, and production methodologies and processes that can be leveraged from the commercial sector to reduce potential non-recurring costs associated with the development of an LROI-type capability.  Vendor responses should provide information on their strategies, methodologies, and established processes associated with prototype, pre-production, and production article designs.
   Of particular interest is vendor collaboration with US sources that supply materials and components either manufactured or developed within the US that can be examined for LROI applications.

<a href="mailto:angela.j.taylor@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Mobile</a>
<DESC>Contractor to remove the starboard generator of the CHOCTAWHATCHEE (a floating crane), and replace it with a remanufactured CAT 3306B marine generator or a newly remanufactured Caterpillar generator set of equivalent power within the following range: Caterpillar Generator Set 3306B (170 ekW 213kVa 60Hz @1800 rpm) - (190 ekW 238 kVa 60 Hz @1800 rpm). The CHOCTAWHATCHEE is a floating crane with a king post mounted SeaTrax SeaKing 7200-DR type crane.  It was built in 2003 by Bender Shipyards, Mobile, AL.  Contractor will be required to perform a site visit prior to award of a contract to confirm size conformity to existing space. General characteristics of the crane are:  Length - 165'; Beam - 50', molded depth amidships -11'-6"; and displacement -1,221 long tons.  Due to the current sound and weatherproof enclosures an identical model remanufactured unit is desired and any other model offered must fit inside the existing enclosures and utilize the existing radiators and mounting arrangement.  A Caterpillar remanufactured unit is required to provide interoperability and sharing of common parts and consumables (filters, belts, seals, oils, etc) with the remaining 3306B generator set on board the CHOCTAWHATCHEE.  With a remanufactured 3306B generator set the fuel delivery system, which includes the injection pump, injectors and governor, must be new parts. The contractor will reuse the existing radiator but will have the unit flushed and cleaned per the manufacturer's recommendations.  The contractor will remove and re-install the generator's enclosure and all covers.  Lifting and setting of the enclosure will be made by the Government with a Government crane with proper coordination with the contractor.    <br><br>The contractor will disconnect and re-connect all wiring, fuel lines, etc. and insure that the replacement generator is fully operational.  The crane barge will be operational during this work, therefore the contractor must ensure that the starboard generator is completely disconnected from the barge's main electrical bus to avoid any accidental re-energizing of the work area until the starboard generator is ready for reconnection and testing.  The contractor will insure that the port generator remains operational at all times during the work.   The contractor will perform a load test on the remanufactured or new generator set to ensure it will operate without any detrimental effects to the generator or barge. <br>The contractor will clean up any spills, trash, or debris generated during the work.  <br>The U. S. Army, Corps of Engineers has a crane barge, the CHOCTAWHATCHEE that is equipped with two 174KW CAT 3306B generator sets (1 port and 1 starboard) to provide vessel service and off vessel service power. The generators are located within weatherproof sound dampening enclosures aft of the barge deckhouse/workshop. The enclosures are bolted to the deck and can be removed and lifted with the vessel's crane.  It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded.  This procurement is set aside for small business under NAICS  811310.  The size standard for which is a concern, including its affiliates whose average annual gross revenue does not exceed $7.0 million for the past three years.   All questions should be sent by email to Angela Taylor, at angela.j.taylor@usace.army.mil.  The solicitation will only be issued as a direct download at the following website:  https//www.fbo.gov.  It will be issued on/about: 05 Jan 2011.  All prospective contractors, subcontractors and suppliers must be registered in Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) before they will be allowed to download solicitation information.  The solicitation will not be provided in printed format, however, the Government reserves the right to revert to paper medium when it is determined to be in the Government's best interest.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS<br /><br />USAID/El Salvador has the intention of competing a Cost-plus-fixed-fee Contract in order to carry out the Crime and Violence Prevention Project.<br /><br />This project will serve as a follow on to USAID's existing crime and violence prevention efforts, and should directly build on the recent gains achieved. The objective of this project is to help increase safety for citizens of El Salvador. This will be accomplished through:<br /><br />1) Supporting the Government of El Salvador's (GOES) national level crime prevention efforts. <br /><br />2) Supporting the expansion of municipal-led crime and violence prevention efforts. This includes both a geographic and technical expansion, such as introducing more complex models and innovations in prevention based upon lessons learned through practice in the U.S. and other relevant country models. <br /><br />3) Identifying and seizing windows of opportunity in crime and violence prevention.<br /><br />The general approach adopted by the contractor should: <br />1) be specifically tailored to the political context of El Salvador; <br />2) employ creative responses and approaches in order to achieve the desired results; <br />3) be flexible, timely and innovative; <br />4) engage partners in a participatory fashion; <br />5) provide technical and intellectual leadership in the field; and <br />6) explore the greater use of science and technology to target crime and violence prevention.<br /><br />The Project will have a <strong>base period</strong> of three years and an <strong>option period</strong> of two years.<br /><br />

The awarded contractor is to provide unique replacement parts and software necessary to maintain the Evotech Endoscope washers. The scheduled maintenance involves periodic replacement of proprietary part which includes the use of proprietary software to program and calibrate and configure the systems.  These systems also require occasional repair services and repairs must be done by the manufacturer due to the proprietary nature of software and replacement parts.  The software and parts are specified and exclusively manufactured by Advanced Sterilization Product.  The estimated cost for the Preventative Maintains and Full Service agreement is $151,634.78 for the base year and two option years.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: This product is being procured under the authority of 41 USC 253 (C) (1) and FAR Part 6.302-1.  

(X)	Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency
         Requirement per FAR 6.302.-1
 
5.	Demonstration of Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualification or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority cited Above (Applicability of Authority)   FAR Part 6.302-1 allows for the procurement of items through other than full and open competition when the agency's minimum needs only be satisfied by a supply or service that is unique and available from only one responsible source.  The VA Loma Linda Healthcare System currently requires Full Service and Preventative Maintenance to maintain the Evotech Endoscope Washers.  These products are specific and exclusively manufactured by Advanced Sterilization Product who own proprietary rights to their products and software they manufacturer.  To ensure effective patient healthcare and to comply with Infection Control Guidelines for the reason stated above, award shall be made to Advanced Sterilization Product.

Furthermore, it will cost the VA Loma Linda Healthcare System additional $144,072, for the required parts needed for the annual maintenance.  

The proposed contract for annual maintenance with Semi-Annual Preventative Maintenance Services with parts is $48, 100.21.  The Government will see an estimated annual savings of $95,971.79 per year if we establish a contract with Advanced Sterilization Product.

<DESC><p>1. Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>National Institute of Standards and Technology<br />100 Bureau Drive Stop 1640 <br />Building 301, Room B129<br />Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640</p>
<p>2. Purchase Request Number: NB686020-12-00510<br />CONTRACT: SB1341-12-SU-0073</p>
<p>3. Authority for Action:</p>
<p>0 FAR 8.405-6(a), Restricting Consideration under GSA Federal Supply Schedules</p>
<p>1 FAR 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a Single Source</p>
<p>4. Describe the supply or service to be acquired and the total estimated dollar value: <br /><br />The NIST-Boulder Quantum Fabrication Facility requires a remanufactured electrostatic chuck for our PlasmaQuest ECR Vacuum Deposition System. The previous chuck's quartz dielectric has failed.</p>
<p>These chucks are prone to failure. If the current chuck would fail our PlasmaQuest ECR Vacuum Deposition System would be down for an extended period of time to have the failed chuck rebuilt. This time delay would prevent many researchers from continuing their work. A spare chuck would overcome the time delay problem.</p>
<p>We require that Electrogrip, the manufacture of our electrostatic chuck located in our PlasmaQuest ECR Vacuum Deposition System, resurface the failed quartz dielectric with a sapphire dielectric. The sapphire dielectric is more durable and has a better dielectric constant than the quartz dielectric.<br /><br />Presently Electrogrip has the failed chuck that need to be rebuilt. They had to inspect it to develop the quote</p>
<p>5. List the proposed contractor (name, contact, and phone number) and describe the unique knowledge or capabilities of the proposed contractor:<br />We propose the rebuild of our spare electrostatic chuck be done by:<br />Electrogrip<br />6945 Lynn Way<br />Pittsburg, PA 15208</p>
<p>Elecrogrip is the manufacture of our electrostatic chucks and the only company that can rebuild them correctly, reliably and within a reasonable time frame.</p>
<p><br />6. Describe your market research efforts and efforts to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:</p>
<p>The proprietary nature of these parts prevents any other vendor from offering us service.</p>
<p>7. State why you feel that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:</p>
<p>Electrogrip has quoted a price based on their standard repair cost schedule.</p>
<p>8. Other:</p>
<p>The prompt requisition of a spare chuck is critical to prevent an extended research delay of dozens of scientists using the NIST-Boulder Fabrication facility if the current chuck fails. Only Electrogrip has the resources and knowledge to refurbish this part.</p>
