EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:
1) Technical Capability; 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance; and 4) Price. 

All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal in importance to price. 

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.  
 
Technical Capability: 
Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. All equipment must be new.  No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered for award.  Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST’s requirements. 

NIST will give stronger consideration to offerors whose proposed equipment exceeds the minimum requirements identified under the following specifications:
	i.    Component 1, MBE A, Specification 5(v);
	ii.   Component 1, MBE A, Specification 5(xxi);
	iii.  Component 1, MBE A, Specification 5(xxii); 
	iv.  Component 1, MBE A, Specification 5(xxvi);
	v.   Component 3, Loading Chamber, Specification iv;
	vi.  Component 5, MBE B, Specification vi.

Experience: 
NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror’s experience building, delivering, and installing automated cluster based MBE systems.  The Contractor must demonstrate that they have manufactured, delivered and installed a minimum of three (3) such systems. 

Past Performance: 
The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  

In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST may evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror’s past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.  

Price:
The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all contract line item (CLIN) prices, including all options, and determine whether that total is a fair and reasonable overall price to the Government.  

  (b) "Options." The Government will evaluate quotations for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that a quotation is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:
1) Technical Capability; 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance; and 4) Price. 

All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal in importance to price. 

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.  
 
Technical Capability: 
Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. All equipment must be new.  No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered for award.  Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST’s requirements. 

NIST will give stronger consideration to offerors whose proposed equipment exceeds the minimum requirements identified under the following specifications:
	i.    Component 1, MBE A, Specification 5(v);
	ii.   Component 1, MBE A, Specification 5(xxi);
	iii.  Component 1, MBE A, Specification 5(xxii); 
	iv.  Component 1, MBE A, Specification 5(xxvi);
	v.   Component 3, Loading Chamber, Specification iv;
	vi.  Component 5, MBE B, Specification vi.

Experience: 
NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror’s experience building, delivering, and installing automated cluster based MBE systems.  The Contractor must demonstrate that they have manufactured, delivered and installed a minimum of three (3) such systems. 

Past Performance: 
The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  

In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST may evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror’s past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.  

Price:
The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all contract line item (CLIN) prices, including all options, and determine whether that total is a fair and reasonable overall price to the Government.  

  (b) "Options." The Government will evaluate quotations for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that a quotation is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
