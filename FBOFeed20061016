SO2, which ran from 1996 to June 30, 2005, was also known as the Quality Improvement in Primary Schools (QUIPS) program. QUIPS combined project assistance and non-project (i.e., budgetary) assistance to support Ghana?s constitutionally mandated program of free, compulsory, universal basic education (fCUBE). QUIPS worked in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Science and Sports (MOESS) and the Ghana Education Service (GES?the implementing agency of the Ministry responsible for pre-tertiary education) to achieve the objective of increasing effectiveness in the primary education system.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) is upgrading the NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) for improved operations.  The existing wind profilers are vertical looking radars, the deployment of which commenced in approximately 1990.  The existing wind profilers operate continuously and provide upper air wind data which the NWS uses in a variety of ways.  In upgrading the NPN, the NWS expects to improve the resolution of wind phenomena in time and space (horizontal and vertical) and accuracy; enhance end-to-end observing system availability, access, archive, quality assurance, and timeliness monitoring; and to make use of the real-time wind profiles as an integrating sensor for a seamless system of systems.  Solicitation DG133W-07-RP-0005 will be issued on or about November 3, 2006 and will close on or about February 2, 2007.  This solicitation will encompass a development phase culminating in the delivery, installation, and testing of a first article wind profiler, followed by a production phase involving delivery and installation of up to 54 wind profilers.  [It is expected that all installations will take place within the United States.]  Additionally, the production phase will provide for initial sparing and initial maintenance of the wind profilers (until the wind profilers are transitioned to Government maintenance).  Both the development and production phases will include provisions for associated services, such as training, and associated supplies, including documentation.  The solicitation will allow for either the upgrade of the existing wind profilers or the replacement of the existing wind profilers.  The solicitation will be structured to allow for up to two awards for the development phase, with a down-select to one contractor for the production phase; however, the Government will not be obliged to make two awards for the development phase.  The Government expects that completion of the work called for by the solicitation will take place within five years after award.  All responsible sources may respond to Solicitation DG133W-07-RP-0005 by submitting a proposal which shall be considered by NOAA.  See Notes 12 and 26.

LOGISTICS TENETS APPLICABLE TO THIS PROCUREMENT:

CONTRACT REPAIR ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM (CREP)

EARLY INDUCTION:
(a)     The Government will forward a list of projections of total contractor overhaul inductions and the number of high-priority overhaul inductions out of this total for each ELIN on this contract every three months.  This projection list will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO).  The first projection list will be forwarded within 14 days after award of this contract.
(b)     This list of projections by ELIN is provided for planning purposes and may result in a contractor’s decision to induct the high-priority overhaul induction projections quantities and non high-priority overhaul projections quantities at the risk of the Contractor, in order to meet the 2-day delivery schedule for high-priority order quantities and the 30-day delivery schedule for the non high-priority delivery order quantities.
(c)      The Government shall issue delivery orders that indicate both the high-priority quantities and non high-priority quantities.  The Contractor will only be paid for the quantities placed on order.
(d)      The Contractor will not be held to the 2-day delivery schedule for high-priority or the 30-day delivery schedule for non high-priority delivery ordering quantities that exceed the aggregate 6 month overhaul induction projections for either the high-priority or non high-priority categories, respectively, during the three-month period after the Government submission of the quarterly overhaul induction projections.  For ordering quantities that exceed such quarterly projections, a 60 day delivery schedule will apply.

CONSOLIDATED REPARABLE INVENTORY (CRI)
(a)     This overhaul effort requires the establishment of a Consolidated Reparable Inventory (CRI) at the Contractor’s facility.    The Contractor shall act as the CRI to store reparable items shipped directly from designated Field Units, an Air Logistics Center (ALC) or from another Contractor’s facility.
(b)     The Consolidated Reparable Inventory Level is hereby established as a range of the aggregate total quantity of all ELINs, with an upper limit of the listed yearly quantities for each and a lower limit of 0 (“zero”) each.  Disposition instructions for items in excess of the maximum level shall be provided by the PMS or Contracting Officer.
(c)      Induction of an item for overhaul from the CRI shall be contingent on the availability of reps in the CRI in conjunction with the early induction provision, which allows the contractor to induct at their own risk.
(d)     Upon completion of the contract, disposition instructions for items remaining in the CRI shall be provided by the Contracting Officer.

CONSOLIDATED SERVICEABLE INVENTORY (CSI)
(a)     This overhaul effort requires the establishment of a Consolidated Serviceable Inventory (CSI) at the Contractor’s facility.   The contractor shall store completed serviceable items and ship them directly to a designated user at a Field Unit, Air Logistics Center (ALC), or other Contractor facility based upon a prioritized demand.
(b)     The CSI of end items shall begin when the overhaul of an item is completed and the item has been inspected and accepted.   For each completed overhaul (unless other shipment instructions have been provided) a WAWF electronic DD Form 250 shall be signed off and the item(s) shall be shipped in place to the Contractor’s Consolidated Serviceable Inventory c/o the Secure Air Force Government Bond Room at the Contractor’s Facility.
(c)      The Consolidated Serviceable Inventory Level is hereby established as a range of the aggregate total quantity of all ELINs, with an upper limit of the yearly quantities listed on Appendix “A” Exhibits for each ELIN, and a lower limit of 0 (“zero”) each. Notwithstanding the CSI level, induction of an item for overhaul will be contingent on the availability of a funded order, a reparable, and a negotiated delivery schedule.
(d)     At the end of the contract ordering period, the government commits to issuing a “Final Reconciliation Delivery Order” to buy back the overhauled valves remaining in the CSI when the ordering period expires.  (This ordering period shall include the option periods, if exercised.)  Since a reconciliation of excess quantities projected by the government (but not actually ordered) will be a continual process covered during the quarterly reviews, the quantity to be purchased by the government at the end of the contract shall be limited to the quantity projected by the government during the 12 months preceeding the end of the ordering period (for all other orders).  The contractor will be requested to provide information on the total quantity remaining in the CSI.  The government will compare this data to it’s own documentation.  Any disagreement that results will either be negotiated or handled under the “Disputes Clause”, at the government’s option.  The quantities on the final reconciliation order shall be deemed as a governmental bona fide need.  The final reconciliation delivery order will require the contractor’s input within 10 (ten) calendar days after expiration of the ordering period (for all other orders).  The contractor shall provide the final count of the total quantity remaining in the CSI that fell within the government’s projections during the preceeding 6 month period of performance.  The final reconciliation delivery order will be issued thereafter and shall be the only delivery order issued after expiration of the ordering period (for all other orders).  This process is expected to be complete 60 days after receipt of the final count from the contractor.  Delivery of the units ordered by the final reconciliation order shall be required within 30 days after receipt of the delivery order unless other terms are negotiated and so stated in the delivery order.


DELIVERY SCHEDULE:
*High Priority Delivery Schedule will be effective 90 days after effective date of contract. High Priority Reparables:  2 days after receipt of order up to the quarterly overhaul projections.  The contractor shall begin production even if all reparable quantities on the delivery orders have not been received.
Low Priority Reparables:  Request the delivery schedule to be 92 EA, 30 days from either ELIN, or a combination of both ELINs, after receipt of order until completion of order.  The contractor shall begin production even if all reparable quantities on the delivery orders have not been received.

*Quantities that exceed the aggregate quarterly overhaul induction projections during the 3 month period after the government submission of the quarterly overhaul induction projections will require a 45 day delivery schedule.

INITIAL PRODUCTION EVALUATION (IPE)
*An IPE (Initial Production Evaluation) will be required on all new sources, as well as sources who have not performed the overhaul in the previous 60 months.  The contractor will have 30 days to prepare for the IPE.  (If an IPE is not required, the contractor will have 30 days to begin production in accordance with the Low Priority Reparables Delivery Schedule.)  The reparables used in the IPE will be applied to the quantity from the first delivery order.  Upon Government IPE acceptance, the contractor will have another 30 days to begin production, on the first delivery order only, in accordance with the Low Priority Reparables Delivery Schedule.

ROB BACK
The contractor is authorized to “Rob-back” subassemblies or parts for installation on another end item to meet delivery requirements.

MISCELLANEOUS  
All serviceables will be shipped from the contractor to the user by utilizing fast transportation methods.

Shipping instructions will be provided to the contractor by phone, fax, e-mail, or other electronic means via the Production Manager.

A copy of all electronic Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) DD-250’s will be sent to the PMS within 2 days of shipment.

A Quarterly Production Management Review (PMRT) will be required at the contractors facility.  The Government requests that this be not separately priced and included in the quoted prices for the actual overhaul services.

A Preaward Survey is required if the apparent successful offer is not a previously proven overhaul service supplier for both NSN’s. 

Under the authority of FAR 6.302, the proposed contract action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 30 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation will identify the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) in the planned solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested parties may identify to the contracting officer, their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements including the P100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service) and the U.S. Land Port of Entry Design Guide.  As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals, including the new standards mandated by EPACT 2005, security requirements, and the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards.  The facility will be designed in metric units.  The project will be LEED certified. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The site is located approximately 65 miles south of Tucson, Arizona.  The site is remote and has a harsh climate.  Access to the Mariposa Port of Entry is provided by Arizona State Road 189 from the north and Mexican Federal Highway 15 from the south.  Since its construction in 1973, this Port has experienced dramatic growth in traffic volumes.   Today it is one of the ten busiest cargo ports along the entire U.S. – Mexico border.  There have been increases in all modes of traffic.  Population growth, increased law enforcement activities, national security requirements, changes in trade policies, and outdated facilities and technology have render this Port in need of expansion, upgrade, and repair.
The goal of this project is to expand and modernize the existing facilities into a state-of-the-art full-service port of entry.  The work will include demolition, renovation, and new construction.  The project will include the Main Building, primary Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) inspection booths, secondary POV inspection booths, pedestrian primary and secondary inspection area, bus inspection area, head house, screened impound inspection area, hazardous materials dock, hazardous materials drive-in pit, pre-primary commercial building,  primary commercial inspection booths, commercial building, commercial docks, X-ray and VACIS locations, seized property vault, kennel, generator backup, outbound facility, export dock, and associated roadwork to facilitate the renovated site.
The Port will remain active during the renovation work.  The phasing of work must not interfere with the port operation.  Temporary facilities shall be incorporated into the design and construction to maintain Port security and operations during construction.
The final design should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the efficient movement of trade and commerce, the security requirements of law enforcement agencies, the new standards mandated by EPACT 2005, and the welcoming of visitors and citizens to the United States of America. 
A traditional design-bid-build, fixed price contract is expected. 

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architecture services,  landscape architecture services, engineering, traffic engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design (CAD), building information modeling (BIM—for all projects receiving design funding in FY07 and beyond, GSA requires spatial program building information models as a minimum requirement for submissions to the Office of the Chief Architect for final concept approvals by the PBS Commissioner; GSA supports the use in all projects of mature 3D-4D-BIM technologies—spatial program validation and beyond—at strategic project phases in support of specific project challenges) and post-construction contract services (PCCS).  The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service), including Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification; EPACT 2005 compliance; customer agency requirements, including the U.S. Land Port of Entry Design Guide.  All facilities, existing and new, incorporated in the design, shall conform to the latest building codes, including but not limited to the most current seismic standards, security requirements, utility systems, fire safety, and the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS).

SELECTION PROCESS
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design.  The Lead Designer will also be involved in commissioning an artist or artists for this project and in assisting with the successful integration of works of arts into the architectural design. 

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:  In Stage I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the Lead Designer and Design Firm.  In Stage II, shortlisted Lead Designer-A/E teams will go through the presentation/interview process.

A/E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the State of Arizona.  During Stage II, the A/E must demonstrate that they meet the geographic limitation.  The A/E firm will address the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and project team in Stage II.  

Stage I

<DESC>Contracting Office Address Department of the Navy, United States Marine Corps, Marine Corps Systems Command, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA  22134-6050 Description The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Quantico, VA intends to increase the scope of contract M67854-06-D-7009 with the Harris Corporation, 2400 Palm Bay Road, NE, Palm Bay, FL 32902-0037 in support of the Lightweight Multi-band Satellite Terminal (LMST).  This source possesses unique knowledge and capabilities required to perform this service.  The contract’s Period of Performance of one base year and four option years (extending to August 2011) will not be changed.  The Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) ceiling of the contract will be increased from $8,000,000 to $60,000,000 to cover the additional level of effort. The proposed contract action, for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302, is for dedicated depot support, management, and sustainment for the LMST Block 5 Transit Case Systems, AN/USC-65(V)1 & (V)2, Lightweight High Gain X-Band Antenna (LHGXA), AS-4429, and the Large Aperture Multi-band Antenna (LAMDA), AS-4429C.  This requirement involves both depot level and resident site support services and materials necessary to provide the ongoing depot level engineering support, depot storage and issue, and depot repair and overhaul, including redeployment of overhauled/ upgraded systems for the LMST, AN/USC-65(V), LHGXA, AS-4429, and LAMDA, AS-4429C, and their respective component repairable Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and assemblies.  The scope of work provides for engineering change proposals (ECPs), spares, tech manuals, training support, and the diagnostics, components, and technical services required for the rest!  oration of defective equipment back to factory specified operating condition.  The restored items will be returned to supply system stock or issued for immediate use to support field requisitions.  The services portion of the contract includes support in the areas of technical, engineering, and logistical services.  In addition, the contract provides resident site support through Field Support Representatives (FSRs) for the subject equipment deployed worldwide.  In addition, all depot maintenance, repair, rebuild, overhaul, and redeployment required to correct anomalies is accomplished.  The Government did not acquire a Level III drawing package, to be used for in-depth troubleshooting and engineering analysis of system problems and anomalies.  Furthermore the proprietary nature of much of the technical data precludes the availability of such drawings (i.e., a complete data package) support for the systems for which this contract is intended.  Services will be performed at !  the contractor's site. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Respondents must provide level of effort and dollar estimates to acquire a full understanding of the design of the equipment.  As part of the written response, a respondent must be able to prove to the Government how depot level and field problems can be identified and corrected without the aid of detailed design drawings.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A written response must include evidence of the respondent’s ability to support the described equipment.  Interested parties with the capability of meeting the proposed requirements are requested to provide an E-mail to the MCSC point of contact, Mr. William R. Waggoner, (william.r.waggoner1@usmc.mil) not later than 1400 (2:00 p.m. EST) on 30 OCT 2006 expressing interest and outlining their capabilities and qualifications t!  o perform the effort.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division intends to enter into negotiations on an other than full and open competition basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to Crews, Luke L., Incorporated, Doing Business As (DBA) Advanced Technology Analysis and Computing (ATAC), 917D Inyokern Road, Ridgecrest, CA  93555, to provide performance based engineering services to support the Automatic Radar Periscope Detection and Discrimination (ARPDD) program as it transitions from the APS-137 radar used in large aircraft and aboard ships to the APS-147 radar in the MH-60R helicopter, and the Distributed Ground-based Threat Detection System (DGTDS) in organizing and displaying test data.  Technical system engineering efforts will include the redesign of ARPDD to use it with an APS-147/helicopter platform which involves a major change from a server-based demonstration architecture to an embedded avionics architecture due to size and weight constraints. The modification requires the red!  esign of various software utilities used by the current ARPDD discrimination subsystem.  Technical system engineering efforts will also include continual testing and upgrading of DGTDS, which requires a better method of archiving and displaying test data.  This type of support requires a broad range of skills and knowledge of Radio Frequency (RF) systems, radar, pattern recognition, all phases of integration and testing of a radar system, and integration and testing on airborne and surface platforms.  This effort also requires past historical knowledge of previous ARPDD problems and their solution in order to successfully transition ARPDD to a new platform, as well as working with the ARPDD and DGTDS data structures, including the following software development tools: Linux, Xcode, C, C++, Objective C, MATLAB, PostgreSQL, and SQL for database.  Knowledge and experience in using these tools is necessary to fulfill the requirements of this requirement.  ATAC possesses the uni!  que qualifications and resident technical expertise to perform this ef fort due in part to the highly technical and historical experience needed.  With their unique knowledge of the ARPDD and DGTDS program, ATAC will support the successful implementation of ARPDD to the MH-60R helicopter using AN/APS-147 radar and to support the organizing and displaying test data for DGTDS within the time required to meet the fleet's requirements.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contract is contemplated for a period of performance of one year plus two option years.  The Level-of-Effort is estimated to be approximately 3,600 hours, including option hours.  Award will be made on or about December 15, 2006.  Any firms believing that they can provide the required services may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than 7 days after the date of publication of this notice.  The firm must clearly show their ability to perform the work without compromising the quality, accuracy, reliability, and delivery of the product to the wa!  r fighter.  Responses shall be submitted to Deborah Winfield, by mail to NAWCWPNS, Code 210000D, 429 E. Bowen Rd - Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108 or fax to (760) 939-9651, or email to Deborah.Winfield@navy.mil. Notes 22 & 26 apply.

<DESC>See Commerce Business Daily Note 22. Notice of intent to award a sole source modification to an existing contract.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to issue a sole source modification to an existing contract to the Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) at the Monterey Institute of International Studies (MIIS), 460 Pierce Street, Monterey, CA, 93940 for an effort entitled Nonproliferation Study In The Area of Weapons of Mass Destruction.  The objective of this effort will be to leverage upon previous work conducted by CNS/MIIS to support DTRAs mission of conducting strategic studies and analyses related to national and international security, chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological, high-yield explosives (CBRNE) threats, homeland defense, and the global war on terrorism.  This effort includes state and non-state proliferation-related activities, and the means and capabilities necessary to effectively and efficiently combat both current and potential CBRNE threats. CNS/MIIS will conduct research, analyses, conferences, and provide expert services that encompass a wide range of WMD subjects in which CNS has unique expertise to meet the requirements of the Statement of Objectives, such as WMD threat anticipation, preparation, prevention, defense, reduction, nonproliferation, counter proliferation, consequence management, arms control and disarmament treaties and agreements, safety and security of WMD, and WMD development, production, deployment, transfers, reductions, and terrorism.  This effort will build upon research and analysis conducted between 2002 to 2006. During this period CNS/MIIS developed vital expertise and provided DTRA with comprehensive monitoring and analysis regarding global nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons issues, missile proliferation, and terrorist groups.  CNS/MIIS monitored the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and their delivery missile systems (NBC/M) in which CNS/MIIS provided research and analysis on threats posed by the spread of NBC/M, its causes, ways to respond, and future challenges, including those involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), terrorism and ways to reduce the threats of WMD terrorism.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS, AND NO FORMAL SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Medical Identification and Treatment Systems (MITS) Joint Product Management Office located in Frederick, MD has a requirement for the further development of midazolam in the Advanced Anticonvulsant System (AAS), for use as an adjunctive treatmen t for seizures associated with nerve agent intoxication.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) is expected to be issued on or about November 8, 2006.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325412 with a size stand ard of 750 employees.  The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition, because it has been determined that AAS is not a commercial item.  The Government has already filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a new indic ation for midazolam in an autoinjector and is currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical study and definitive animal efficacy studies.  The requested effort shall require a Contractor to coordinate and manage all activities associated with drug development co nsistent with eventual approval by the Food and Drug Administration under the Animal Rule (Federal Register 67: 37988-37998, May 31, 2002; 21 CFR 314 Subpart I).  Associated activities will include: obtaining current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) c ompliant active pharmaceutical ingredient (API); compounding an acceptable formulation that is compatible with and stable in an autoinjector; cGMP compliant manufacturing and testing of the midazolam-filled autoinjector product; International Conference on  Harmonisation compliant stability testing; conducting Good Laboratory Practices compliant non-clinical studies and Good Clinical Practices compliant Phase 2 clinical studies; preparation and submission of a New Drug Application (NDA).  The RFP will also i nclude an option for initial production of 150,000 doses loaded into autoinjectors.  An important aspect of this requirement is that the drug and autoinjector are approved by the FDA as a system.  The offeror must have the capacity to manufacture both the drug and the autoinjector, either in its own facility, or with subcontracted effort, but the outcome of this requirement is for a total FDA approved product.  Specifications for the autoinjector may be obtained by contacting Sandra OConnell, email address  as shown below.   Proposals will be evaluated on a Best Value basis.  The NDA will be submitted by the successful offeror. The expected delivery of this product is First Quarter of the Government Fiscal Year 12 (1QFY12).  Alternate delivery schedules may be proposed by the offerors but the Governments preference is for not later than FY12.  All interested parties will be able to view, download, and print a copy of the solicitation and any resulting amendments when released at the USASMDC website hyperlink : http//:www.smdc.army.mil/contracts/contracts.html.  No paper copies of the RFP will be provided and no mailing list will be maintained.  Questions or correspondence should be directed only by e-mail to Sandra.oconnell@det.amedd.army.mil and should refere nce RFP number W9113M-06-R-0022.

GFM and CAP are NOT authorized. All materials and support equipment will be furnished (CFM).

DELIVERY SCHEDULE:
Delivery schedule to be 92 EA, 30-Days ARO until completion of Order.  If a delivery order is placed with less than 92 EA, that quantity will be required to be delivered within 30-Days ARO.  The contractor shall begin production even if all reparable quantities on the delivery orders have not been received.


INITIAL PRODUCTION EVALUATION (IPE)
*An IPE (Initial Production Evaluation) will be required on all new sources, as well as sources who have not performed the overhaul in the previous 60 months.  The contractor will have 30 days to prepare for the IPE.  Upon Government IPE acceptance, the contractor will have another 30 days to begin production, on the first delivery order only, in accordance with the Delivery Schedule.  (If an IPE is not required, the contractor will have 30 days ARO and repairables to begin production IAW the delivery schedule.)  

ROB BACK
The contractor is authorized to ?Rob-back? subassemblies or parts for installation on another end item to meet delivery requirements.

MISCELLANEOUS  
All serviceables will be shipped from the contractor to the user by utilizing fast transportation methods.

Shipping instructions will be provided to the contractor by phone, fax, e-mail, or other electronic means via the Production Manager.

A copy of all electronic Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) DD-250?s will be sent to the PMS within 2 days of shipment.

A Quarterly Production Management Review (PMRT) meeting will be required.  At least the first PMRT will be held at the contractor?s facility.  Subsequent PMRT?s will be held either by telephone or at the contractor?s facility, depending on the statuor’s facility.    The Contractor shall act as the CRI to store reparable items shipped directly from designated Field Units, an Air Logistics Center (ALC) or from another Contractor’s facility.
(b)     The Consolidated Reparable Inventory Level is hereby established as a range of the aggregate total quantity of all ELINs, with an upper limit of the listed yearly quantities for each and a lower limit of 0 (“zero”) each.  Disposition instructions for items in excess of the maximum level shall be provided by the PMS or Contracting Officer.
(c)      Induction of an item for overhaul from the CRI shall be contingent on the availability of reps in the CRI in conjunction with the early induction provision, which allows the contractor to induct at their own risk.
(d)     Upon completion of the contract, disposition instructions for items remaining in the CRI shall be provided by the Contracting Officer.

CONSOLIDATED SERVICEABLE INVENTORY (CSI)
(a)     This overhaul effort requires the establishment of a Consolidated Serviceable Inventory (CSI) at the Contractor’s facility.   The contractor shall store completed serviceable items and ship them directly to a designated user at a Field Unit, Air Logistics Center (ALC), or other Contractor facility based upon a prioritized demand.
(b)     The CSI of end items shall begin when the overhaul of an item is completed and the item has been inspected and accepted.   For each completed overhaul (unless other shipment instructions have been provided) a WAWF electronic DD Form 250 shall be signed off and the item(s) shall be shipped in place to the Contractor’s Consolidated Serviceable Inventory c/o the Secure Air Force Government Bond Room at the Contractor’s Facility.
(c)      The Consolidated Serviceable Inventory Level is hereby established as a range of the aggregate total quantity of all ELINs, with an upper limit of the yearly quantities listed on Appendix “A” Exhibits for each ELIN, and a lower limit of 0 (“zero”) each. Notwithstanding the CSI level, induction of an item for overhaul will be contingent on the availability of a funded order, a reparable, and a negotiated delivery schedule.
(d)     At the end of the contract ordering period, the government commits to issuing a “Final Reconciliation Delivery Order” to buy back the overhauled valves remaining in the CSI when the ordering period expires.  (This ordering period shall include the option periods, if exercised.)  Since a reconciliation of excess quantities projected by the government (but not actually ordered) will be a continual process covered during the quarterly reviews, the quantity to be purchased by the government at the end of the contract shall be limited to the quantity projected by the government during the 12 months preceeding the end of the ordering period (for all other orders).  The contractor will be requested to provide information on the total quantity remaining in the CSI.  The government will compare this data to it’s own documentation.  Any disagreement that results will either be negotiated or handled under the “Disputes Clause”, at the government’s option.  The quantities on the final reconciliation order shall be deemed as a governmental bona fide need.  The final reconciliation delivery order will require the contractor’s input within 10 (ten) calendar days after expiration of the ordering period (for all other orders).  The contractor shall provide the final count of the total quantity remaining in the CSI that fell within the government’s projections during the preceeding 6 month period of performance.  The final reconciliation delivery order will be issued thereafter and shall be the only delivery order issued after expiration of the ordering period (for all other orders).  This process is expected to be complete 60 days after receipt of the final count from the contractor.  Delivery of the units ordered by the final reconciliation order shall be required within 30 days after receipt of the delivery order unless other terms are negotiated and so stated in the delivery order.


DELIVERY SCHEDULE:
*High Priority Delivery Schedule will be effective 90 days after effective date of contract. High Priority Reparables:  2 days after receipt of order up to the quarterly overhaul projections.  The contractor shall begin production even if all reparable quantities on the delivery orders have not been received.
Low Priority Reparables:  Request the delivery schedule to be 92 EA, 30 days from either ELIN, or a combination of both ELINs, after receipt of order until completion of order.  The contractor shall begin production even if all reparable quantities on the delivery orders have not been received.

*Quantities that exceed the aggregate quarterly overhaul induction projections during the 3 month period after the government submission of the quarterly overhaul induction projections will require a 45 day delivery schedule.

INITIAL PRODUCTION EVALUATION (IPE)
*An IPE (Initial Production Evaluation) will be required on all new sources, as well as sources who have not performed the overhaul in the previous 60 months.  The contractor will have 30 days to prepare for the IPE.  (If an IPE is not required, the contractor will have 30 days to begin production in accordance with the Low Priority Reparables Delivery Schedule.)  The reparables used in the IPE will be applied to the quantity from the first delivery order.  Upon Government IPE acceptance, the contractor will have another 30 days to begin production, on the first delivery order only, in accordance with the Low Priority Reparables Delivery Schedule.

ROB BACK
The contractor is authorized to “Rob-back” subassemblies or parts for installation on another end item to meet delivery requirements.

(c)      Induction of an item for overhaul from the CRI shall be contingent on the availability of reps in the CRI in conjunction with the early induction provision, which allows the contractor to induct at their own risk.
(d)     Upon completion of the contract, disposition instructions for items remaining in the CRI shall be provided by the Contracting Officer.

CONSOLIDATED SERVICEABLE INVENTORY (CSI)
(a)     This overhaul effort requires the establishment of a Consolidated Serviceable Inventory (CSI) at the Contractor?s facility.   The contractor shall store completed serviceable items and ship them directly to a designated user at a Field Unit, Air Logistics Center (ALC), or other Contractor facility based upon a prioritized demand.
(b)     The CSI of end items shall begin when the overhaul of an item is completed and the item has been inspected and accepted.   For each completed overhaul (unless other shipment instructions have been provided) a WAWF electronic DD Form 250 shall be signed off and the item(s) shall be shipped in place to the Contractor?s Consolidated Serviceable Inventory c/o the Secure Air Force Government Bond Room at the Contractor?s Facility.
(c)      The Consolidated Serviceable Inventory Level is hereby established as a range of the aggregate total quantity of all ELINs, with an upper limit of the yearly quantities listed on Appendix ?A? Exhibits for each ELIN, and a lower limit of 0 (?zero?) each. Notwithstanding the CSI level, induction of an item for overhaul will be contingent on the availability of a funded order, a reparable, and a negotiated delivery schedule.
(d)     At the end of the contract ordering period, the government commits to issuing a ?Final Reconciliation Delivery Order? to buy back the overhauled valves remaining in the CSI when the ordering period expires.  (This ordering period shall include the option periods, if exercised.)  Since a reconciliation of excess quantities projected by the government (but not actually ordered) will be a continual process covered during the quarterly reviews, the quantity to be purchased by the government at the end of the contract shall be limited to the quantity projected by the government during the 12 months preceeding the end of the ordering period (for all other orders).  The contractor will be requested to provide information on the total quantity remaining in the CSI.  The government will compare this data to it?s own documentation.  Any disagreement that results will either be negotiated or handled under the ?Disputes Clause?, at the government?s option.  The quantities on the final reconciliation order shall be deemed as a governmental bona fide need.  The final reconciliation delivery order will require the contractor?s input within 10 (ten) calendar days after expiration of the ordering period (for all other orders).  The contractor shall provide the final count of the total quantity remaining in the CSI that fell within the government?s projections during the preceeding 6 month period of performance.  The final reconciliation delivery order will be issued thereafter and shall be the only delivery order issued after expiration of the ordering period (for all other orders).  This process is expected to be complete 60 days after receipt of the final count from the contractor.  Delivery of the units ordered by the final reconciliation order shall be required within 30 days after receipt of the delivery order unless other terms are negotiated and so stated in the delivery order.


DELIVERY SCHEDULE:
*High Priority Delivery Schedule will be effective 90 days after effective date of contract. High Priority Reparables:  2 days after receipt of order up to the quarterly overhaul projections.  The contractor shall begin production even if all reparable quantities on the delivery orders have not been received.
Low Priority Reparables:  Request the delivery schedule to be 92 EA, 30 days from either ELIN, or a combination of both ELINs, after receipt of order until completion of order.  The contractor shall begin production even if all reparable quantities on the delivery orders have not been received.

*Quantities that exceed the aggregate quarterly overhaul induction projections during the 3 month period after the government submission of the quarterly overhaul induction projections will require a 45 day delivery schedule.

INITIAL PRODUCTION EVALUATION (IPE)
*An IPE (Initial Production Evaluation) will be required on all new sources, as well as sources who have not performed the overhaul in the previous 60 months.  The contractor will have 30 days to prepare for the IPE.  (If an IPE is not required, the contractor will have 30 days to begin production in accordance with the Low Priority Reparables Delivery Schedule.)  The reparables used in the IPE will be applied to the quantity from the first delivery order.  Upon Government IPE acceptance, the contractor will have another 30 days to begin production, on the first delivery order only, in accordance with the Low Priority Reparables Delivery Schedule.

ROB BACK
The contractor is authorized to ?Rob-back? subassemblies or parts for installation on another end item to meet delivery requirements.

MISCELLANEOUS  
All serviceables will be shipped from the contractor to the user by utilizing fast transportation methods.

Shipping instructions will be provided to the contractor by phone, fax, e-mail, or other electronic means via the Production Manager.

A copy of all electronic Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) DD-250?s will be sent to the PMS within 2 days of shipment.

A Quarterly Production Management Review (PMRT) will be required at the contractors facility.  The Government requests that this be not separately priced and included in the quoted prices for the actual overhaul services.

A Preaward Survey is required if the apparent successful offer is not a previously proven overhaul service supplier for both NSN?s. 

Under the authority of FAR 6.302, the proposed contract action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 30 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation will identify the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) in the planned sol

This procurement is to contract for up to two PASS detector units enhanced for military use, with an option for subsequent acquisition of up to three PASS detector units with further miltary-specific enhancements. This effort seeks to optimize the detector for use in a military operational environment by simplifying the software graphical user interface; providing enhanced user friendliness and capabilities; enhanced detection reproducibility, consistency and minimized risk for false alarms; and increased in-field performance of the detector. These enhanced capabilities will provide military personnel/users of the detector a significantly more reliable method of screening cargo/materials for different types of contraband items of potential concern that might be hidden in cargo/materials containers.  The effort is separated into two phases, the base (Phase 1) is directed at enhancing the unit to provide further automation and an alternative readout, to specifically address user interface issues noted in an initial evaluation of the commercial PASS detector unit during operational testing in May 2006. The option (Phase 2) is directed at

<DESC>The following solicitation is the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 2nd attempt at soliciting proposals for the ToxCast Program?s requirement entitled "ToxCast Prioritization of Environmentally Relevant Chemicals: (P#2) Bioactivity Profiling of the ToxCast Compound Library."  The procurement was recently the focus of a pre-solicitation conference which was held on September 27th at the Washington, D.C., offices of the Office of Acquisition Management of the U.S. EPA.  Information concerning the conference and procurement can be found at the following website: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/0615840/index.htm THE REQUIREMENT ADDRESSED IN THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE PROCURED AS FOLLOWS: FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIVE PROCEDURE.  THE APPLICABLE NAICS CODE IS 541710. BACKGROUND: The Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development established the National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) in 2005 to research the utility of computational chemistry, high-throughput screening (HTS) and various toxicogenomic technologies for Agency use in chemical prioritization, quantitative risk assessment and biological modeling. As part of this, the NCCT is developing computational tools for interpreting data from these technologies to classify chemicals, predict toxicity, and prioritize limited testing resources towards chemicals and endpoints that present the greatest risk to human health and the environment. Thus a chemical prioritization research program, entitled ToxCast, is being initiated with the purpose of developing the ability to predict, or forecast toxicity.   The proof-of-concept phase of ToxCast will focus upon chemicals with a rich toxicological database (e.g., registered pesticide actives), in order to provide an interpretive context. The ToxCast program will evaluate chemical properties and effects across a broad spectrum of information domains: physical-chemical properties, predicted biological activities based on existing structure-activity models, biochemical properties based on HTS assays, cell based phenotypic assays, and genomic and metabolomic analyses of cells.    SCOPE: Much of the data in these various domains will be generated through a series of seven (7) integrated Performance Work Statements (PWS).  Six (6) of these PWS have already been advertised under other solicitations.  The proposals received against those solicitations are currently under review.  The contracts that will be awarded for all of the work will be essential components of the ToxCast program over the next five years, providing data populating the various domains that can be interpretively linked to known or predicted toxicological properties of environmental chemicals. This Request for Proposal (RFP) (# PR-HQ-06-15840) is the re-soliciting of work previously described under the RFP # PR-HQ-06-14708 which was entitled "ToxCast Prioritization of Environmentally Relevant Chemicals: (P#2) Gene Family Panel Screening of the ToxCast Compound Library." That RFP was canceled by the EPA on August 31st.  Potential offerors and interested parties should visit the EPA website to review all documents that relate to the program and these procurements.   The EPA website is at: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/0615840/index.   It should be noted that hard copies of the RFP for PWS P#2 will not be mailed out, but will be available for down-loading from the EPA website along with all associated and supporting documents.  Email the Contracting Officer at "nanartowicz.john@epa.gov" to express your interest in this solicitation package.  Please include in your e-mail your firm?s complete name and address for Source List purposes.   Due to the anticipated large volume of interest, we will be unable to return phone calls or respond to e-mail inquiries for these procurements.     You may be able to retrieve a copy of the RFP package on or about October 30, 2006.

History:  As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS will replace its current claims payment contractors, fiscal intermediaries and carriers with new contract entities called Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs). As a result of MMA, CMS designed new MAC jurisdictions to balance the allocation of workloads, promote competition, account for integration of claims processing activities and mitigate the risk to the Medicare program during the transition to the new contractors. 

Describe the work: The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of health care services, both institutional and professional, for a defined geographic area or ?jurisdiction.? The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program.

Further, the Contractor will coordinate its activities not only with the CMS, but also with a broad range of agencies (at the federal, state, and local levels of government), other CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders within the health care system of the United States.

The Contractor will receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction and will perform standard or required editing on these claims to determine whether the claims are complete and should be paid. In addition, the Contractor will calculate Medicare payment amounts and arrange for remittance of these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also will enroll new providers; conduct redeterminations on appeals of claims; operate a Provider Customer Service Program that both responds to provider telephone and written inquiries and provides educational opportunities with respect to the Medicare program; respond to complex inquiries from Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs); and make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of different provider services, such as enrolling new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers on Medicare?s rules, regulations, and billing procedures. In addition, the Contractor will staff CMS? Medicare provider toll-free lines to answer a wide range of provider questions for its jurisdiction. The North American Industrial Classification Sysytem (NAICS) code is 524114: direct Health and Medical Insurance Carriers.

Capability Statements shall be limited to 20 pages and shall include any/all teaming arrangements. 

Teaming Arrangements:  All teaming arrangements shall also include the above-cited information and certifications for each entity on the proposed team. Teaming arrangements are encouraged.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information only.  There is no solicitation at this time.  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) has an urgent need for armoring material handling and construction equipment.  The contractor shall be capable of building prototypes, integrating, producing and providing test support and installing Add on Armor (AoA) and Crew Protection Kits (CPK) for USMC Material Handling and Construction Equipment.  The contractor must have access to classified information and have the appropriate facilities and management controls to support secret levels of clearance.  The contractor must have experience in the areas of armor and survivability. The intent of this Request for Information is to find industrial solutions to provide armor kits for the equipment listed as follows. •	High speed, high mobility crane (Produced by Harnischfeger P&H, model HSHMC-25) NSN 3810-01-320-1920 •	All Terrain Crane (Produced by DEMAG/TEREX)  Model MAC-50, NSN 3810-01-538-4030 •	Full-tracked, crawler type tractor with angle blade (Produced by Case, model 1150) NSN 2410-01-254-1667 •	Full-tracked, crawler type tractor with multi-purpose bucket (Produced by Case, model 1155) NSN 3805-01-315-1091 •	Extendable boom forklift truck (Produced by JLG, model MMV) NSN 3930-01508-0886 •	Lightweight rough terrain forklift truck (Produced by Terex, model 51-19MD) NSN 3930-01-533-0855 and NSN 3930-01-478-3519 •	Backhoe Loader (Caterpillar 420D/E model) NSN 3805-01-514-7166 •	Sweeper, Runway (Elgin Crosswind) NSN 3930-01-504-2618 The armor kit can either be an AoA kit or cab replacement.  The AoA shall not degrade the Roll-Over Protection System (ROPS) of the vehicle.  If the armor kit is a cab replacement type, it shall be certified as a ROPS for the vehicle.  The one exception is the HSHMC and MC-50 vehicle where the requirement for ROPS does not apply. The quantities range from 10 to 50 kits per asset. The following requirements must be met. Direct Fire: The armor shall provide a 95 percent Probability of No Penetration (PNP) against a single impact incident from 7.62 AP at muzzle velocity.  The probability shall be calculated at an 80 percent Lower Confidence Bound (LCB).  The armor shall provide this protection level against the threat from all aspects (3600) 00 elevation 00 azimuth. Indirect Fire/IED: The armor system shall provide limited flank and floor protection against fragmentation from IED.  This protection shall be equivalent to a 50 percent probability of no penetration from the 20mm Fragment Simulating Projectile (FSP) at 3600 ft/s.  This FSP velocity combination is intended to validate that the armor is capable of protecting to the 94 percentile fragment of a 152mm artillery round at 2 meters.  The probability shall be calculated at an 80 percent Lower Confidence Bound (LCB).  The system must also protect crew and passengers from fatal blast effects of the 152mm artillery round detonated at 2 meter standoff.  Transparent Armor (TA) minimum protection rating should follow STANAG AEP55 for protection level 5.  To the greatest degree feasible, normal operator visibility should be maintained following a ballistic impact.  Installation of an armor kit shall not impede the operator’s ability to ingress or egress the equipment. Additionally, the kit shall contain an emergency egress hatch or window which can be accessed from either the exterior or interior of the vehicle.  Latches or locking mechanisms shall be common equipment. The emergency egress shall allow escape in the event that the cab door is inaccessible or inoperable.  Doors shall incorporate a device (also known as a combat lock) that allows the door to be secured from the inside.  The combat lock shall prevent the door from being opened from the outside by enemy personnel and by the force of an IED explosion.  An override shall be provided so that emergency personnel outside the cab can open the door The armor kits shall include environmental controls to maintain a viable operating environment inside the armored crew compartment/cab.  The design shall include additions or modifications for armor support, doors with latching mechanism(s) and a separate/emergency egress (in case of vehicle rollover).  The contractor shall minimize ballistic gaps to the maximum extent practical when the armor kit is installed on to the vehicle.  Joints attaching hardware shall be designed to resist separation under blast pressure.  All original equipment glass shall be removed from the system before the armor is installed.  The design shall include alterations to existing vehicle systems and components as necessary for safe operation (e.g. longer wiring harness, hoses, etc.).  The contractor shall perform a trade-off analysis for each system identified.  The analysis shall include:  an engineering assessment of the impact of the armor kit to the vehicle and their subsystems performance (e.g!  . tires, axles, suspension, drive train, hydraulics, electrical power, air conditioning system) relating to speed, lift capability, center of gravity, vehicle reliability, vehicle maintainability, visibility, transportability, and safety.  The contractor shall deliver a feature-based parametric 3D model along with its 2D associated drawings in Pro-Engineer format or a format compatible with Pro-Engineer.  The contractor shall develop, validate, and provide installation instructions for each system.  The instructions shall contain an Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB) of all components, assemblies and hardware.  The IPB shall utilize clear and concise line drawings. The contractor shall provide one (1) set of the operating door side assembly, including opaque armor, transparent armor, hinges, latching hardware, and support structure for each system to be armored.  The Government shall test the contractor provided door assembly in order to verify ballistic performance of the armor kit design as well as kit integration.  Fasteners and gaps will be evaluated.  The contractor shall provide support at Aberdeen Test Center, MD during Government tests. The contractor shall provide a Field Service Representative (FSR) for installation and post-installation support of armor kits in CONUS and worldwide (e.g. Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Korea, Japan, etc.).  The contractor must be capable of providing the required prototype kits within 90 days of contract award,  delivery of production quality CPK’s after testing and trade off analysis 60 days and Delivery of TDP’s, Drawing packages, Support and Parts packages  after testing 120 days.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis for market research purposes only at this time. The General Services Administration (GSA), Southeast Sunbelt Region, seeks potential sources for the Investigation, Design and Construction services for building envelope water intrusion repairs at the US Courthouse, Tampa, FL. The contractor will be required to provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided) and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all design and construction work to meet GSA agency requirements. The Overall Estimated Construction Cost Range for this project is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. Completion time is expected to be between 360 and 420 days.  Solicitation for this project is anticipated 02/2007.


THE PROJECT 
The US Courthouse was completed in 1998 and has been experiencing a series of problems related to water infiltration through the building envelope.  The building is 400,000 sf and consists of 17 floors, plus a mechanical penthouse.  The overall height of the building is 380 ft. Several studies as to the cause of the water infiltration have been completed and will be made available for review after a request for proposal has bee issued. The components of the project include a systematic inspection of the curtain wall for water intrusion problems, the design of a repair(s) to correct the water intrusion, the construction of the repairs, the testing of the repairs, monitoring indoor air quality, interior finish work necessary to complete the required repair work, and roofing work.

The following is an outline of the project components:

1.	Systematic inspection:  The extent and severity of the problems are unknown since a comprehensive inspection of the entire building facades has not been performed. The contractor shall examine and disassemble (as necessary) the curtain wall system to determine the cause of the water infiltration.

2.	Design of repairs: Once the source or cause of the water infiltration has been identified the contractor shall design a repair procedure.  The procedure shall be submitted to GSA for review and approval prior to implementation. Any design that changes or modifies the structural load path shall be designed by a licensed professional engineer.

3.	Construction of repairs: Upon approval from GSA with the proposed repair procedure the contractor shall implement and the repair.

4.	Testing the repair areas: Upon completion of the repairs the curtain wall assembly shall be water tested to assure the adequacy of the repair work.

5.	Monitoring Indoor Air Quality: Due to the water intrusion isolated occurrences of mold have been discovered within the building maintenance. During the contractor's course of the work the indoor air quality shall be periodically monitored to ensure the construction activities have not caused the release of any mold partials. During the investigation or construction if any mold is uncovered the contractor shall take all necessary steps to isolate the mold and perform the necessary remediation.

6.	Interior finish work:  Interior finish work may be required to repair interior damage resulting from the water intrusion repair work.

7.	Roofing work: The GSA has surveyed the roof of the building and identified areas in need of repairs to eliminate the water intrusion problems.

Through the Construction Excellence program, GSA will employ the best practices that will result in the best project for the best value; and procure the highest quality construction services as early as practical. 

GSA is actively seeking General Contractors who can provide full Construction Services (to included curtain wall reapir, engineering, roofing, interior repairs, environmental, forensic engineering, electrical and mechanical)  for this project through a procurement method developed in accordance with FAR Part 15.1, Source Selection Processes and Techniques.

<SUBJECT>C -- Basrah Children's Hospital AE Services
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT.  The Joint Contracting Command - Iraq/Afghanistan, Baghdad, Iraq intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Hospital Designers and Planners (HDP), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.  Authority cited is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Paragraph (a)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  This effort is for the Architect and Engineering Services required to complete the construction of the Basrah Children's hospital, Basrah, Iraq.  The Basrah Children's Hospital (BCH) facility will be a state-of-the-art, 160,000 sq ft, 94-bed acute and referral care center with a focus on pediatric oncology.  Built on 13 acres, it will be a leader in childrens health care for the southern governorates, providing high impact specialty services not otherwise available in Iraq.  It will also serve as the Center of Excellence with the goal of becoming a training facility to improve and expand the training of health professionals throughout Iraq and become the health facility and best practices model for future hospital renovations and new health facility construction across the country.  The construction is currently 30% complete.  By direction of the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and the Director, Iraq Reconstruction and Management Office (IRMO), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) canceled the current job order with Bechtel National, Inc. (BNI) on contract SPU-C-00-04-0001, Job Order 04-511, for construction of the Basrah Children's Hospital.  The A-E of record, HDP, is responsible for the 100% design of the hospital.  HDP will continue in its role to review and approve all shop and material-issued-for-construction submittal drawings related to the hospital.  The proposed contract with HDP, the design firm, will ensure completion of the hospital as it was designed and awarded under the BNI contract.  It is well recognized in the industry that it is critical to successful project completion to keep the construction and designer team intact if at all possible from start to finish.  HDP has AE liability for the design of this hospital.

This is not a Request for Proposal and no solicitation packages will be issued.  All responses will be considered and must include proof of familiarity with the Basrah Children's Hospital as well as specific experience with hospital designs.  Responses shall include company name, address, POC, phone number, fax number, email address, business size, taxpayer identification number (if applicable), DUNS number and CAGE Code.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Basrah Children's Hospital Equipment Integration
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE.  The Joint Contracting Command - Iraq/Afghanistan, Baghdad, Iraq intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Universal Hospital Services, Amman, Jordan.  Authority cited is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Paragraph (a)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirements.  This effort is for the services of an equipment integrator to provide management and technical services, including procurement of some of the equipment, for the integration and configuration management of state-of-the-art hospital equipment during construction of the Basrah Children's Hospital, Basrah, Iraq.  The Basrah Children's Hospital (BCH) facility will be a state-of-the-art, 160,000 sq ft, 94-bed acute and referral care center with a focus on pediatric oncology.  Built on 13 acres, it will be a leader in childrens health care for the southern governorates, providing high impact specialty services not otherwise available in Iraq.  It will also serve as the Center of Excellence with the goal of becoming a training facility to improve and expand the training of health professionals throughout Iraq and become the health facility and best practices model for future hospital renovations and new health facility construction across the country.  The construction is currently 30% complete.  By direction of the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and the Director, Iraq Reconstruction and Management Office (IRMO), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) canceled the current job order with Bechtel National, Inc. (BNI) on contract SPU-C-00-04-0001, Job Order 04-511, for construction of the Basrah Children's Hospital.  UHS is the equipment integrator, clinical space planner and interior designer of record.  The designer of record has worked with UHS throughout the design and from the time of award of the construction contract.  It is critical that the continuity of the original design and integration contractors be maintained through completion of the facility, training of staff, the warranty period and follow-on operations and maintenance of the facility and equipment.   

This is not a Request for Proposal and no solicitation packages will be issued.  All responses will be considered and must include proof of familiarity with the Basrah Children's Hospital as well as specific experience with hospital equipment integration and interior design.  Responses shall include company name, address, POC, phone number, fax number, email address, business size, taxpayer identification number (if applicable), DUNS number and CAGE Code.  All responses must be received NLT 1630 hours, Baghdad, Iraq, October 27, 2006.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Pursuant to the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Subparts 6.302-1(a)(1) and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(a), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competitive procedures is justified for this procurement action.  The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2 (Content). 1. Contracting Agency - United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Central Office, Administration Division, Acquisitions Branch, National Acquisitions Section.  2. Description of Action - The BOP, Office of Information Systems has a requirement for the maintenance renewal of 300 software licenses for the Stedman?s Plus Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker Premium ASCII Edition Software, and the acquisition of 896 additional licenses.  The Medical Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker Software is used and incorporated with the BOP?s existing Electronic Medical Records (EMR) System. 3. Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency?s Needs - Inclusive of the Estimate Value - The BOP requires the Stedman Pharmaceutical Software for use with the EMR system currently in use by the agency.  The software maintenance services for licenses include: 1.All new software releases; 2. System update; 3. Program temporary fixes (PTFs); 4. Documentation updates; and 5. Toll-free hot-line support twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week for system software assistance.  The estimated value of this acquisition is estimated at $30,281.96.  4. Statutory Authority Substantiating this Action - FAR   6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - (1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  5. Reason for Authority Cited - The BOP requires the renewal for software maintenance and acquisitions of additional licenses for the Stedman Plus Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker software for the EMR system.  The software will be part of the current system and will migrate to the new system currently under development.  In addition, the EMR system is a rights protected system and the EMR software vendor utilizes the Stedman software as the spell-check feature on the pharmacy module.  The Stedman vendor, Wolter Kluwer Health, Inc., owns the proprietary rights for the Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker software and has not authorized this product to be offered for resale by other vendors.  6. Efforts to Obtain Competition - Due to Wolter Kluwer Health, Inc., owning the proprietary rights to the Stedman?s Plus Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker software and that the product has not been authorized for resale by other venders, no further efforts to obtain competition were made.  7. Contracting Officer's Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination- A review of the proposed price was completed by the Contracting Officer.  Based on the submittal from the vendor and a comparison of current and historical acquisition data for similar maintenance renewals and acquisitions of software licenses, it was determined that the quote was based on established market pricing and is acceptable to the Government.  The Contracting Officer has made the determination that proposed price is fair and reasonable.  8. Market Survey- FAR 10.001 - Market research was conducted by both the requiring activity and Contracting Officer.  It has been determined that the spell-check software provided by Wolter Kluwer Health, Inc., owns the proprietary rights for this product and service and is not authorized for resale by other vendors.  9. Other Factors- The software licenses, maintenance service and support is required to work in conjunction with the agency?s EMR system.  Lack of spell-check software and maintenance for this system would be detrimental to the BOP, as the pharmacy systems controls and directs the types and amounts of medication being dispensed to the inmates.  10. List of Sources ? Wolter Kluwer Health, Inc., 351 West Camden Street, Baltimore, MD 21201.  11. Action to be taken to Promote Future Competition- The Bureau of Prisons will continue to conduct market surveys and make efforts to obtain competition for future acquisitions.  12. Contracting Officer's Certification- I hereby certify this request for Justification and Approval of Other than Full Competition is made in good faith, the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and I would not be making this request if it were feasible to fully compete this requirement.  I further certify that this request is not the result of lack of advance planning or a desire to expend funds while those funds are still available.  //s// Kelly J. Young, Contract Specialist; National Acquisitions Section.  Approval: //s// Jan R. Johns, Chief, National Acquisitions Section.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
Project Number GHLN 06-1097

Install carpet in building 1292 and the corridor connecting building 1294

1. GENERAL:
a.   Carpet is not government furnished. Contractor shall supply carpet and deliver it to building 1292 for installation. See attached drawings for locations of new carpet.

b.   All other materials (adhesives, edge strips, floor stone, seam joining materials, etc.) are to be furnished by the Contractor and of a type suitable for the purpose intended.

c.   There is existing carpet to be removed. Contractor is responsible for off-base disposal.

d.   Hazardous Materials (HM) Approval. Contractor shall submit a Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for each chemical and/or compound proposed carpet or vinyl installation to the Base Bioenvironmental Office (90 ADOS/SGGB) for review and approval prior to delivery to the base. A HM is defined in Federal Standard DED-STD-313D, Tables I and II. The definition of materials presenting a health or physical hazard is found in OSHA 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.1200(c).

e.   Hazardous Materials Management. All HM shall be managed, stored and monitored in full compliance with all applicable local, state, federal and Air Force regulations. Contractors who bring hazardous materials onto FEW AFB without authorization are responsible for any punitive or regulatory actions. Contractors are responsible for proper disposal of containers/hazardous material. Flammable liquids shall be stored in an approved fireproof storage cabinet. All chemicals shall be secured and properly stored when not in use.

f.   Prohibited Hazardous Materials. Prohibited materials include those that contain Class 1 ozone-depleting substances (including CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and methyl bromide) per Air Force Policy and as regulated by Title VI of the Clean Air Act, specifically Sections 601-607. Other prohibited construction materials include lead (i.e. lead-based paint), asbestos, PCBs or other hazardous substances.

g.   New and Recycled Materials and Equipment Purchasing. All materials shall be new or newly manufactured using recycled materials unless otherwise indicated. All materials (both new and recycled) shall be the most suitable and highest grade and type for the intended use unless otherwise indicated. They shall be produced by a manufacturer regularly engaged in manufacturing or fabricating similar products with a history of successful production acceptable to the Contracting Office. When names of manufacturers or models are
 
listed, the purpose is to give examples of products meeting the specifications and to provide a basis for comparison subject to the following: (1) The product is equivalent to the specified product meets or exceeds the requirements of the specifications and is otherwise suitable for the intended use. (2) The warranty meets or exceeds that of the specified product and the requirements of the specifications. (3) The Contractor coordinates the installation and makes any necessary changes at no additional cost to the Government. (4) The Contractor waives claims for any time extension associated with the use of the product.

h. Recycled Product Purchases. Contractors must comply with guidelines and requirements of The Air Force Affirmative Procurement Program for the purchase and use of recycled material. This is required by Presidential Executive Order and Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (42 U.S.C. 6962). The use of recycled products is mandatory unless they are not available within a reasonable time frame, or if the cost exceeds the cost of a non-recycled item or if they do not meet the technical requirements of the project, or if they are not available from at least two (2) sources so as to maintain a satisfactory level of competition. The construction materials included under this requirement are all types of carpet made of polyester fiber and floor tile containing recovered rubber or plastic. The use of other recycled products is encouraged.


i. Recycled Products Reporting. Contractors must compile a "Recycled Products Report" for the Resource Recovery and Recycling Manager at 90 CES/CEV listing the total quantity recycled products used.

k. Affirmative Procurement Guidance. The use of recycled material shall follow requirements based upon Department of the Air Force Space Command Affirmative Procurement Program Policy and Guidance Letter dated 8 April 2002. The main legal requirements for an Affirmative Procurement Program (APP) are derived from Executive Order 13101 dated 14 September 1998 (http;//www.ofee.gov) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Section 6002 (http://www.ornl.gov/ornlp2/sec6002.htm). This policy requires action by the Federal Government or its authorized agents to make more efficient use of natural resources by maximizing recycling and preventing waste whenever possible. Specifically, it mandates procurement of the five EPA guideline items; calls for review of government plans and specifications to eliminate virgin material requirements; requires recycling programs and requires consideration of: recovered materials use, reuse of products, life cycle cost analysis, ease of recycling, and use of environmentally preferable products.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR LITHIUM ION BATTERY DELTA ACCEPTANCE TEST.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions: Question #1.  Item 9 lists five GFE battery chargers. Two of them are “LIB GSE Chargers”. Three of them are “LIB Chargers”. Items 3, 4 and 5 define the LIB testing steps and the term “LIB GSE Charger” is used exclusively. Is it correct to plan that any of the five GFE chargers (“LIB” type and “LIB GSE” type) can be used interchangeably to perform steps 3, 4 and 5?  Answer #1.  Yes, the LIB Charger and the LIB GSE Charger can be used interchangeably. The only difference in the designs is the source power interface. You must provide the GSE with 110Vac while the LIB Charger needs 120Vdc.  Question #2.  Assuming that the answer to question 1 is “yes”, is it correct to assume that the 19 LIB units can be tested in two batches? We assume that the USB computer interface to each charger will be connected and used during all testing. Does each charger require a separate Windows XP laptop to run the data recording code?  Answer #2.  The 19 LIBs can be tested in two batches. One laptop with two USB ports can be connected to a single charger to record the OCVs, CCVs, and charge performance of two LIBs. This is done by running the laptop code twice (once for each channel) simultaneously. We have never tried to connect more than two charging channels to one laptop. But theoretically, with a USB multipler port, you could record more channels on a single laptop. Note that discharge at 3.8A can not be done by the LIB Charger or LIB GSE Charger. You must provide a means to discharge the LIBs separate from the provided chargers.  The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 10/10/2006.  Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
