<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is conducting a full and open competition to acquire the services of a qualified U.S. Contractor to implement a new education program which consists of a two-pronged approach that aims to increase access to quality and relevant education, building on past successes of increasing the number of rural girls completing basic education, and to improve skills training opportunities. 
The measurement of success is job placement and school completion.  Thus, the program addresses Morocco’s three-fold problem of unemployed out-of-school youth, lack of relevant education and training to provide skills for employment, and high illiteracy rates.  Coupled with this, the FTA with the U.S. offers Morocco a chance to transform itself and become a full and active participant in the global economy.  However, the transition to a new, more open economy will require new skills, with ramifications for both rural and urban populations.

Any resultant contract must include a minimum goal of 10% for small business subcontracting.

The base period of performance for this contract is four years plus one option year. The range for this activity is between $28 million to $32 million.

The preferred method of distributing the USAID procurement information will be through Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov).     It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about May 10, 2004.     It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it has been received in its entirety and USAID bears no responsibility for data error(s) resulting from downloading.     All correspondence regarding this notice must be submitted in writing.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Warren Grant Magnuson Center (Clinical Center), Medical Record Department (MRD) has a requirement for Medical Transcription Services.  The contractor will be responsible for providing transcription of a variety of specialized medical reports dictated by patient care physicians and other authorized medical professionals.  These specialized reports may be categorized into four groups: medical reports, diagnostic reports, pathologic reports and letters to outside physicians.  Additionally, the contractor will be responsible for assigning ICD-9-CM codes to relative information dictated in medical reports.  The estimated volume for a single twelve (12) month period is as follows:  Medical Reports and Letters Volume, 28,500,000 words, 26,000 reports/letters; Diagnostic Reports Volume, 6,200 reports, 17,546 pages; Pathologic Reports Volume, 18,960 reports; Coding Volume, 26,700 codes.  Lastly, the contractor shall be responsible for providing transcription services for radiological, nuclear medicine and PET reports dictated by staff physicians and radiologists.  Specifically, the Diagnostic Radiology Department, Nuclear Medicine Department and PET Imaging Department are a part of the Imaging Sciences Program providing clinical imaging services for the Clinical Center.  Images are archived in a PACS (Picture Archive Communication System).  An integrated Radiology Information System (RIS) assigns demographic information for imaging exams and manages workflow for the Imaging Sciences Program.  The RIS receives orders from the hospital information system and sends corresponding reports back to the hospital information system through an interface.  Radiologists and other Imaging Sciences clinicians dictate results of imaging procedures into a Dictaphone Digital Dictation System and those reports will be transcribed by a contractor directly into RIS.  Reports created in the RIS are sent to the dictating clinician for review and finalization.  Final results are sent to the hospital information system through an interface following electronic review, verification and electronic signature of the responsible clinician.  The estimated volume for a single twelve (12) month period is as follows: 57,850 reports.  The period of performance will be for a basic twelve (12) month period, with options to renew for five (5) additional twelve (12) month periods.  This requirement is set-aside for small business concerns under the applicable NAICS code, 561410 with a size standard of $6.0 million.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released fifteen (15) days after this synopsis publication.  Request for the solicitation must be provided in writing via mail, email or fax.

<DESC>C—Architect Engineer Services Solicitation # GS05P04GBC0020- Toledo, OH
The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a new Court House for the Federal District Courts in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  This project will have a principal emphasis on site development, new construction and infrastructure improvements. The building is approximately 20,500 gross square meters (224,000 gross square feet) including 35 interior parking spaces, on a Government owned site located within the Central Business District of Toledo, Ohio.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is $60 million to $70 million.  The facility will be designed in hard metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum: site and building design, metric construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a Federal Court House that includes the construction of the new building and related systems, indoor parking, site development, client program development, socio-economic and sustainable program features.  This project is to include GSA design standards for secure facilities and U.S. Marshals Service construction and security requirements, U.S.Courts Design Guide, as well as specific tenant-agency security requirements.  This building will be an anchor development in the neighborhood and should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the overall urban design, quality of life and shall be consistent with the historic site concept of the Toledo Civic Center Mall.  The project will provide a facility that meets energy goals and includes sustainable design and construction practices (LEED). This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E firm as defined as in this RFQ is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept and the building’s architecture.  The A/E Firm must clearly define the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and its ability to manage the design and production of construction for GSA.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants related to meeting the requirements of this RFQ for Stage I. The Government may provide a stipend for Stage II (Charrette), which will be determined at a later date.  The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, an interested firm will submit a portfolio of accomplishments to establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8-1/2 x 11 format.  The Stage I submission should include the following: A) a cover letter referencing the Fed Biz Opps announcement and briefly describing the firm, its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; B) Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project) modified to include only the A/E’s information (Identification of consultants is not required at this stage) and C) a design portfolio which is to include the following submission requirements and evaluation criteria: (1) Lead Designer Portfolio (35% of evaluated score): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer’s ability to provide design excellence.  Submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a typewritten description (maximum of two pages per project) of up to three new construction projects completed in the last ten years.  The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria #3, the Lead Designer will address his/her participation in the project. (2) Philosophy and Design Intent (25%): In the Lead Designer’s words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state his/her overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters that may apply in creating a state-of-the-art Courthouse in an urban neighborhood environment. (3) Past Performance on Design (25%): The A/E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) of not more than five new construction projects completed in the last ten years.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, phone, and fax numbers.  A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan and either a site plan or a building section. (4) Lead Designer Profile (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer, a representative of the client and professional representatives from GSA will evaluate the submissions.  The Board will establish a short-list of three to six firms.  For Stage II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. In this stage the entire project team, including the A/E firms selected in the first stage, their designated Lead Designers and ALL the consultants who will work on the project will be evaluated. The firms will be required to complete Standard Forms 254 and 255 that reflect the entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  A brief period, approximately 3weeks, will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  In developing the Stage II project team, A/E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the state of Ohio.  The Selection Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, professional qualifications, and team organization and management plan.  The Stage II evaluations will require an interview with the A/E Evaluation Board and will culminate with a one day Design Charrette on the day following the interviews. The purpose of the Design Charette is to further evaluate the design merits of each Designer’s “Vision”. The design Charette results will be used in conjunction with Stage II rankings in the final evaluation of the A/E firm. The Design Charrette results will be evaluated by a jury of GSA Peer Professionals. The evaluation criteria to be used by the jury shall include: community context, architectural strategy and image, courthouse functionality and sustainable design. The submitted design concepts become the property of the Government. Associated plans, drawings or specifications provided under this solicitation are intended for use by prospective bidders/offerors (and their subcontractors and suppliers). In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to building drawings/plans, security equipment, security equipment installations, and contract guard service, to include: 1) Limiting reproduction and/or dissemination of covered materials only to persons/parties related to this acquisition or otherwise authorized to receive such information; 2) Making every possible effort that is reasonable and prudent to prevent unauthorized disclosure of this information; 3) Upon award and completion of any appeals process, unsuccessful bidders/offerors making every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all information/documentation received during the solicitation and/or appeals process; and 4) The awardee continuing the efforts required above throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the “awardee”

Seq., the A-E will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to Small, small woman-owned, small minority-owned, small HUBZone, small Veteran-Owned, and small Service Disabled Veteran-Owned businesses.  The use of subcontractors/consultants shown in the Stage II 255 and SF 254 will be reflected in a Subcontracting Plan which will be included in the contract.  The detailed plan is to be submitted with the SF-255 in Stage II.  Each individual firm will determine the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals for this project.

<DESC>The Intramural Research Program (IRP), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Karolinska Institutet in Sweden for a project titled “Dopamine Neuron Study.”  Karolinska Institutet possesses unique biological modeling research on both human and animal populations.  It also has a proven track record to study large samples of DNA from many different populations of cases and controls in Sweden and in several other areas of the world, in particular its ability to search for genetic variants in candidate genes that associate with Parkinson’s disease.  We anticipate a 2-year contract to conduct research using Karolinska’s established collection of human tissue samples, and study collections of postmortem brain tissues from brain banks from patients with Parkinson's disease and controls, as well as tissue from the gastrointestinal tract and liver.  Karolinska also possess the required immediate ability to use cellular reporter systems in conjunction with these tissue samples.  Statutory authority to justify this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.320-1, Only One Responsible Source.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in providing the required services make competition unfeasible.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), National Design, Construction, and Soil Mechanics Center, located in Ft. Worth, TX intends to solicit bids to develop NRCS concrete design criteria that will become Chapter 30, Cncrete, National Engineering Handbook, Part 636, Structural Engineering (NEH 636.30).  The criteria contained in the new NEh 636.30 will replace existing NRCS contrete design criteria.  In addition to the development of NEH 636.30, it is required to prepare and provide PowerPoint-based presentations on the new criteria at two workshops to be sponsored by the NRCS.  Coordination, correspondence, reproductions, workshop facilities, and notification of workshop attendees will be the responsibility of the NRCS.  NEH 636.30 will contain details for the design of conventionally reinforced and plain concrete structures and  structural elements.  Most of the NRCS structures are considered environmental or hydraulic concrete structures such as those used for conveying or storing water, wastewater, or other materials such as solid agricultural waste.  Criteria for these type structures will parallel ACI 350-01.  NRCS also utilizes traditional structures that are not required to meet the environmental/hydraulic structure standards.  Criteria for those structures will parrallel ACI 318-02.  Design information will be in sufficient detail to provide thorough design instructions and examples, along with basic concrete design concepts in a manner that is equivalent to a basic level textbook on concrete design.  All mathemathical details and examples are to be presented in both U.S. customary units and metric units.  The two workshops will be the instrument used to introduce NRCS engineering personnel to the requirements presented in NEH 636.30.  Each seminar is expected to require 2 business days.  The period of performance for the successful contract is 480 calendar days after contract award.

This requirement covers one (1) contract line item, performance period 01 May 2004 through 30 September 2004. All responses to this solicitation/request for proposal must make reference to the Solicitation Number FA2816-04-T-0002 and be submitted by 4:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on 26 April 2004. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-09. This solicitation is a 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification is 541511. The size standard is $21 million. The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating is: UNRATED. Item to be Procured:  CLIN 0001: QTY: 300 - Unit of issue: “HOURS” Database Management Support and Training (Non-Personal Service). Provide user and administrator training for internally developed relational database management system formerly known as “HIDE”.  With the recent developments and modifications to the “HIDE” system, two separate databases have been created, “RM Central” and “CM Central”.  This Statement of Work will encompass both systems, “RM Central” and “CM Central” for the above stated requirements. This database management system was custom developed by Defense Office of Joint Program Requirement (DOJPR) and Datasphere LLC.  Datasphere LLC owns the rights to the intellectual property of the program code.  Although DOJPR has distribution and licensing rights to “RM Central” and “CM Central”, they do not have access to the source code for this database.  Therefore, only Datasphere LLC can perform required maintenance, optimization and support for the system.  Upon approval and acceptance of this contract, DOJPR shall appoint a contracting officer’s technical representative (COTR).  The Contracting Officer and/or COTR shall be the vendor’s sole point of contact at DOJPR for the purposes of this contract.  The vendor acknowledges that he or she shall accept tasks and work assignments only from a Contracting Officer and/or COTR.  No other DOJPR personnel, staff or employee shall have the authority to direct, propose or direct maintenance, support or other services from the vendor.  Requests from DOJPR members other than a duly appointed Contracting Officer and/or COTR shall not be construed by the vendor as authority or requirement to perform additional work or services. Services are to be performed at DOJPR’s El Segundo location, but may also be required or performed at other DOJPR offices at the discretion of and with the approval of the COTR.  This contract does not authorize or fund any additional hours performed outside of the DOJPR’s offices. The contract does not authorize or fund per diem or travel expenses incurred by the vendor.  The vendor assumes all responsibility and shall make no claim for travel costs and per diem under this contract.  Payments under this contract shall be limited exclusively to actual time spent by the vendor on site at DOJPR performing maintenance, optimization, support and training services specified in this contract.  Payments for hourly services performed by the vendor shall be paid on a monthly basis once invoiced by the vendor and verified/certified by the Contracting Officer and/or COTR.  No payment for services shall be authorized without such Contracting Officer and/or COTR certification and verification.  DOJPR’s COTR shall provide a separate task list (included with the Statement of Work) to the vendor upon acceptance of this contract.  The list shall be classified SECRET.  This is a maintenance contract only and shall not provide for the development of additional features of components for the system.  Tasks shall belong to one or more of the following categories of services and support required by DOJPR under this contract: (a) Maintenance – Maintain, repair and adjust existing code, tables, components, forms, reports, queries and relations of “RM Central” and “CM Central” per the approval of the COTR. (b) Optimization– Make such changes as are necessary to “RM Central” and “CM Central” components (i.e., codes, tables, relations, etc.) to optimize the system for stability, data integrity and usability per the approval of the COTR.  (c) Support of “RM Central” and “CM Central” – Provide technical support as required to DOJPR users of “RM Central” and “CM Central” responsible for administration and operation of the databases.  (d) Training – Provide training in the use of operation of the system.  Assist DOJPR users of “RM Central” and “CM Central” systems in developing additional training and procedures for the use, operation and administration of the system.  Because the actual “RM Central” and “CM Central” systems and the data contained are classified SECRET, the vendor must possess at least a SECRET security clearance.  The vendor shall not copy or remove any classified material from any of DOJPR’s facilities without the express written permission of the Chief of DOJPR or the unit security manager.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River MD, intends to award a sole source cost type order against Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-03-G-0003 to United Technologies, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC) in support of the MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopter Program.  This is the second of a three phase effort to replace the existing MH-60R Halon fire extinguishing system with non-ozone depleting substance, which will shall have the same level of fire extinguishing capacity/efficiency as the current system.  SAC shall provide the preliminary design and analysis necessary to further define the non-Halon aircraft engine and APU Fire Extinguishing system and the aircraft modifications required to implement the candidate system selected in Phase I. This effort will result in the delivery of a risk reduction test article that can be used to accurately simulate an H-60 engine nacelle fire, a non-Halon fire extinguishing system prototype which will be installed in the test article and associated test plans and test data results.  As the sole designer of the MH-60R air vehicle, SAC is the only known source with the knowledge, experience, and data to perform this effort.  To award this contract to another vendor would result in excessive duplication of effort and costs to the Government.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), 
Division of Cancer Etiology and Genetic (DCEG), Viral Epidemiology Branch (VEB) intends to procure laboratory services to perform quantitative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing for detection of polyomavirus DNA in human specimens.  A role for viruses in the etiology of childhood cancer has been long posited. Polyomaviruses represent attractive candidates for causative agents of childhood cancer. Recently, investigators described detection of BK virus DNA in neuroblastoma tumors from children. NCI will extract DNA from specimens obtained from neuroblastoma patients, children without neuroblastoma, and laboratory controls.  The University of Colorado will utilize real-time PCR to detect and quantify BK virus DNA in these DNA extracts. They will utilize primers from two regions of the polyomavirus genome, namely the T antigen and VP1 genes. They will utilize PCR assays with demonstrated sensitivity of at least 100 viral copies in 500 ng of genomic DNA. Amplified products consistent with BK virus shall be sequenced for confirmation. The laboratory shall also perform similar PCR assays for JCV, as a negative control. Finally, to assist the NCI in exploratory studies of the role of other polyomaviruses in human cancer, the PCR testing laboratory shall perform similar PCR testing for simian virus 40 (SV40) and lymphocytic polyomavirus (LPV).  Thus, Dr. Garcea’s labotaroty shall perform quantitative PCR testing for DNA from two gene regions (T antigen and VP1) of these  four polyomaviruses (BK, JC, SV40, and LPV).  Dr. Garcea’s laboratory at the University of Colorado is the only laboratory known to the end user that can perform these tests.  This laboratory developed and validated these assays.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on May 4, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402 4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402 4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. NAICS 541380.  Size Standard 6M.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is only seeking information at this time. The issuance of this RFI does not guarantee that there will be any procurement action as a result of response or lack thereof to this document.  With the exception of some special purpose vehicles, DHS is interested in consolidating its fleet management operation under a single, full-service provider in order to reduce administrative burden and maximize the cost-effectiveness of its motor vehicle operations. This RFI seeks input on the concept of operating the DHS fleet as a service, and on what that service should include. DHS and its components operate a total fleet of approximately 32,000 motor vehicles. These vehicles are used by the Department’s organizational components for a number of purposes. In addition to transportation of personnel for local travel and regulatory compliance functions, vehicles are used for surveillance and investigative law enforcement missions, marked police patrol, executive and dignitary protection, and other purposes such as border patrol and immigration enforcement or transportation of property and equipment. They operate in a highly diverse set of conditions ranging from well maintained, paved roads to severe off-road conditions and extremes of temperatures – both hot and cold. Because of the nature of the functions these vehicles perform, they are an essential part of each component’s operation and are, in many cases, mission critical tools. The creation of DHS has resulted in the amalgamation of a number of entities, each operating its own fleet, establishing its own policies and procedures governing use and assignment of vehicles, and using disparate systems and levels of data collection for vehicle management.  Vehicles are acquired, maintained, and disposed of through multiple sources. Here are some Fleet Characteristics: Approximate fleet size to be provided under this initiative is estimated at  28,000 light duty vehicles; Vehicles are to be new when placed in service and replaced on a 3 year or 50,000 mile cycle; Vehicle acquisition, delivery, licensing, and disposal are to be included in the scope of services provided; A full service lease is desired, including a nationally recognized, widely accepted fleet card to be used for fuel and maintenance services; Vehicles are to be available for both long term lease (1 year or more), short term  lease (6 months or less), and on a daily rental basis; A wide variety of domestic and import makes and models, in sufficient quantities,  must be available in order to support the diverse needs of the Homeland Security fleet; compact, intermediate, full size, luxury, and police or ‘special service’ package sedans, coupes and station wagons; Minivans, full size passenger vans and cargo vans; 2 wheel and 4 wheel drive sport utility vehicles in small, intermediate and larger sizes; 2 wheel and 4 wheel drive pickup trucks in small, intermediate and full size categories; Insurance coverage is to be included; Maintenance management service is desired, with a toll – free number for operators to use in requesting authorization to have services performed locally; Accident management services are desired: Directing driver’s next steps and if needed, making emergency phone calls; Notifying all key parties, including adverse party; Estimating and appraising repair costs; Notifying liability insurance carrier and fleet manager via fax; Provision of a replacement or loaner vehicle. Registration and Titling service is to be provided. Personnel and systems with top secret or higher clearances and safeguards for secure or sensitive information may be necessary. Comprehensive management information and reports are to be provided on vehicle usage and costs with a minimum monthly frequency.  Real or near real time on-line access to reports is preferred, using a secure site. Support for the Department’s activities in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands is required. A single point-of-contact for bureau level coordinators to work with is desired. A dedicated full-time contract manager for this effort is preferred. Alternative fuel and hybrid vehicles are preferred for non-law enforcement use. Please submit comments and insights at your earliest convenience, but not later than May 21, 2004.  Comments may be sent by fax to (202) 772-9749 if under 10 pages, or by email to Steven.Sosson@dhs.gov

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Richard P.  Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>This solicitation is hereby amended to provide instructions for proposal preparation and submittal. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-22. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. Solicitation Number 1435-04-04-RP-34604 applies; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP). The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity GovWorks, will manage the following procurement action on behalf of the US Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency.  BACKGROUND.  For most FCIC insurance plans, an individual insured's yield guarantee (approved APH yield) is principally based on a simple average of four to ten years of actual yields.  A long-standing concern with this procedure among insureds is the potential for large reductions in the approved APH yield following successive years of low yields.  In addition to determining the insurance guarantee, the average yield is used for classifying an insured's risk and thus affects his or her premium rate.  RMA's rating functions imply that the risk of an indemnifiable loss is a decreasing function of yield, e.g., the frequency and severity of indemnifiable losses are greater for low-yielding insureds than for high-yielding insureds.  The degree to which an insured's average yield is above the county average (reference yield), the insured's premium rate is reduced and vice-versa.  However, a consequence of this risk classification system is that when insureds experience a period of abnormally low yields, not only does the insurance guarantee decline but also the premium rate increases.  This occurs at the very time that the insureds tend to be most vulnerable financially.  It is this combination of decreasing guarantee and increasing premium rate that reduces the usefulness of crop insurance for some insureds.  The year-to-year decline in an insured's yield guarantee, and the corresponding increase in the premium rate, can significantly reduce the ability of growers to participate in the crop insurance program.  OBJECTIVES:  The SOO for this program describes the basic, top-level objectives for developing new or revised methods for mitigating declines in an insured's approved yield following successive years of low yield, and is provided in lieu of a written Government performance-based Statement of Work.  This approach provides potential Offerors the flexibility to develop cost effective and innovative solutions that meet the stated goals and objectives of this request for proposals.  RMA's goal is to obtain proposals for: (1) research and development of new and innovative approaches to mitigating declines in yield guarantees following successive years of low yield, or provide improvements to existing procedures; and/or (2) research and development of new and innovative procedures for determination of approved APH yields. To view the complete Statement of Objectives and proposal information, access www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp; look up Solicitation Number 1435-04-04-RP-34604.  HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, (A) A CAPABILITIES STATEMENT in accordance with the instructions in the SOO.   References will be checked. Capabilities Statements will be evaluated based on; (i) key personnel skills, abilities and experience; (ii) your organization's experience and (iii) past performance (including number, size, and complexity of similar projects), adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered products. (B) A TECHNICAL PROPOSAL in accordance with the proposal instructions in the SOO.   (C) A COST PROPOSAL in accordance with the proposal instructions in the SOO, which shall be a separate volume from the written portion of the Technical Proposal.  The Cost Proposal shall clearly indicate the proposed labor categories, hours, ODCs, travel, and material for this effort.  (D) The completed OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS per FAR subpart 52.212-3.  (E) VERIFICATION that the Offeror is currently registered in the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  GovWorks shall make no award to unregistered contractors.

It is requested that all interested parties submit a current completed and certified DD Form 2345 (Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement) to NAWCADLKE Contracting Office.  It is anticipated that the contract will be a multi-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract where during the first year, the contractor shall be required to provide up to 10 pilot-production units for both contractor and Government testing.  After successful completion of the pilot-production testing, the Government shall issue delivery orders for production units over the next five years.

This procurement shall enhance the Fleet's operational performance by meeting current requirements, reducing life cycle costs, and improving reliability and maintainability.  The contractor shall manufacture and test all units in accordance with the requirements of the performance specifications, the engineering Statement of Work (SOW) and the Logistics SOW.

The purpose for the test set is to perform a GO/NO-GO check of systems at the organizational level as well as intermediate level test and check of the AN/ASW-25 LINK-4 ACLS system.  The RFP will request integration of these test capabilities into one unit.  All CRAFT units will be packaged in accordance with best commercial practices.  Delivery shall be FOB Origin.  This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.

Scope of Work

The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, has a requirement for the study, evaluation, review, technical investigation and analysis of current and emerging knowledge and technology in selected areas of food processing, food safety, food security, and human health issues.  Three kinds of analysis/reviews shall be requested under the terms of this contract:  Comprehensive Reviews, Abbreviated Reviews, and Technical Investigation and Analysis for Potential Solutions.  The successful contractor shall be responsible for providing comprehensive reviews in the subject scientific areas and shall emphasize the essential components of an independent scientific review and evaluation.  The approach selected to address the topics identified by FDA for each Comprehensive Review shall emphasize the essential components of an independent scientific review and evaluation.  Every effort shall be made to minimize bias in the review of scientific information.  The final reports shall carefully document divergent scientific opinions.  The contractor shall prepare, within sixty days of initiation of each Comprehensive Review, a detailed Scientific Plan that describes a reasonable approach to address the scientific questions posed by FDA.  This plan shall take into account the complexities of the issues raised.  A project schedule shall be included in the Plan to indicate how the contractor shall organize the work to be performed for each Comprehensive Review.  In addition some abbreviated reviews are anticipated requiring rapid response and analysis and summaries of emerging issues in selected topics.   Abbreviated Reviews are intended to provide FDA with rapid analysis and summaries of emerging issues in the areas of food safety and health; they are normally completed within one to six months.  Requests for Abbreviated Reviews of selected topics shall be interspersed during the life of the contract.  The contractor shall prepare a written report summarizing the review and the conclusions or recommendations reached.  The basic types of Abbreviated Review activities that may be requested by FDA:  “Quick Response Actions on Request” shall address specific scientific issues such as the scientific merit of research proposals, new research, food processing and technological developments, and food safety and security concerns.  Predictive Response shall provide perspectives on issues in the field of food safety and security for approaching scientific areas of science evaluation, which are relevant to FDA’s mission.  Technical investigation and analysis of potential solutions to specific food safety or food security issues shall be requested under the terms of this contract.  These investigations involve a review of the food processing systems and activities and determination and validation of the preventive measures that can be applied by industry, particularly small and medium business, to eliminate or minimize a food safety hazard or food security vulnerability.  The contractor must have state-of-the-art knowledge on relevant scientific issues relating to food processing, food safety, food security, and human health.  The contractor must have a multidisciplinary scientific based organization that has experience and sufficient scientific expertise necessary to conduct research in the areas mentioned above.  It is anticipated that this requirement will result in an ID/IQ multi-year contract with task orders.   Many of the resulting task orders may be for research relating to bio-terrorism and or counter terrorism issues.   Because of the security issues involved in conducting this type of research it will be necessary to classify these projects as secret or top-secret.  It should be noted that any offeror interested in this procurement must possess the ability to obtain the necessary security clearances if they receive the contract.  Technical questions should be sent to the Contract Specialists e-mail address or fax number contained herein.

Each proposal shall be sent to Mr. Joshua Minorics, jminoric@pica.army.mil by  4:00pm ET, April 7, 2004.  Telephone and/or written requests are not necessary,  as this announcement constitutes the technical requirement in full text.   Information on the above listed technologies will be provided to the interested  offeror upon request.  All proposals should be received by the date and time  stated above.   STATEMENT OF WORK HE 441D RS and AT4CS RS Engineering Analysis 1.0	SCOPE  This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the requirements for an engineering study  to explore IM solutions to the HE 441D RS and AT4CS RS which would render them  IM compliant. The contractor shall provide the necessary materials, services,  personnel, equipment and data in accordance with the requirements of this  Statement of Work. 2.0	BACKGROUND The HE 441D RS is a member of the MAAWS M3 family of ammunitions. The MAAWS M3  is utilized by the United States Special Forces as one of the primary weapons  in both training and combat scenarios.   The AT4CS RS is a stand-alone, single  shot, pre loaded, shoulder fired weapon.  The HE 441D RS and the AT4CS RS are  not fully IM compliant, both failed to achieve minimum threshold requirements  during previously conducted IM testing.   3.0	APPROACH The approach to be utilized will be that of an engineering study.  The study  will include analysis and limited tests (as required) to determine feasibility  of numerous approaches. At the culmination of the 441D RS analysis it is  desired that flying debris, from the test article, be restricted to 50 feet of  the testing item.  For the AT4CS RS it is desired to defeat the S&A device in  the case of an inadvertent launch (threshold) with the objective being  preventing the projectile from launching.   4.0	WORK REQUIREMENTS 4.1	Support Integrated Product Team (IPT) Meetings and IM Test activities  during execution of the contract. 4.2	Focus engineering studies, analysis and testing (as required) towards  the following goals:   HE 441D RS: Prevent fragments (cartridge case and fuze assembly) from traveling in excess  of 50 feet.  Currently these items travel in excess of 90 feet during fast and  slow cook off testing.   AT4CS RS Prevent launch of the munition (objective) during fast cook off, slow cook off,  and bullet impact.  If this is not achievable, the threshold requirement is to  render the S&A inoperable in IM environments.   The engineering studies, analysis and testing should address numerous design or  packaging solutions.  They should include but are not limited to: -AT4CS RS packaging: PA171 type steel can with pressure vents. -HE 441D RS packaging:  PA157 type steel can. -HE 441D RS packaging:  Steel mesh liner. -AT4CS RS S&A device:  Mechanical pin to block connection of detonator. -AT4CS RS S&A device:  Thermo explosive pellet to lock S&A or pre-fire  detonator in safe position.   5.3 Period of Performance – The period of performance of this effort shall not        exceed six months. 5.4	Deliverable Reports -Monthly Progress Report (DI-MGMT-80227). As part of the first monthly report,  an overall program schedule shall be included detailing the planned effort and  projected test events. At the culmination of this exercise a detailed engineering trade study report  depicting IM solutions that could be adapted to the AT4CS RS and 441D RS shall  be required.

<DESC>BAA Amendment 001: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 1. QUESTION: Could you please tell us the desired max length and diameter of the desired engine, potential production quantities for costing purposes, who is the vehicle contractor and contact?     ANSWER: At BAA announcement, Section 2, paragraph d. states that:  The contractor shall work closely with the NLOS-LS LAM prime contractor to ensure propulsion module integration and functionality.  The contractor should get this information from the Prime - Netfires, LLC, joint venture between Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control - Dallas (LMMFC-D)and Raytheon Corporation. 2. QUESTION: How may we obtain a SECRET Security clearance? Who should we contact to begin the process?     ANSWER: The Defense Security Service (DSS) provides security services in all 50 states. Here is the website:Defense Security Service:http://www.dss.mil/isec/pcl_index.htm   Clearance starts with:  Sponsorship: The very first step to clearing a company is for them to be sponsored for a facility clearance by either a government contracting activity (GCA) or another cleared company. The Facility Clearance Division has a sample sponsorship letter http:/ /www.dss.mil/isec/FCL_Request_Form.doc that the sponsoring organization may use to submit the sponsorship, see below:  If you currently have a contract maybe that agency that awarded the contract to you can sponsor you. Also, SBA helps businesses, here is the SBA website:Small Business Administration:http://www.sba.gov/ 3.  QUESTION: Will the Army accept proposals from contractors in the process of obtaining a SECRET Security Clearance?     ANSWER: Yes, the government will accept your proposal as long as your company is in a position to possess that secret clearance. 4.  QUESTION: Is there any that we and our group of consultants, all of whom are located  in the US and are citizens, could submit a proposal without being a SECRET  facility?    ANSWER: No - The BAA specifies a secret clearance because some of the technologies used in the LAM missile are secret.  In addition, some of the technologies to be used in the engine development are considered classified and Military Critical Technology .  In order to insure adequate development of the propulsion system, and also insure its successful integration into the missile, a secret clearance is required. 5. QUESTION: What information can you provide regarding the NLOS-LAM mission (speed/altitude points plus duration).      ANSWER:  BAA Section  2, paragraph d. it states that:  The contractor shall work closely with the NLOS-LS LAM prime contractor to ensure propulsion module integration and functionality.  The contractor should get this information from the Prime: Netfir es, LLC, joint venture between Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control - Dallas (LMMFC-D) and Raytheon Corporation. 6. QUESTION: What is the payload weight?      ANSWER:  BAA Section  2, paragraph d. it states that:  The contractor shall work closely with the NLOS-LS LAM prime contractor to ensure propulsion module integration and functionality.  The contractor should get this information from the Prime: Netfir es, LLC, joint venture between Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control - Dallas (LMMFC-D) and Raytheon Corporation. 7. QUESTION: Is there a specific cost target you have designated?     ANSWER: Cost estimates are addressed in the Synopsis.  There is no funding profile per year available.  It would be up to the contractor to determine the level of effort and the resources required to complete the tasks.   8. QUESTION: What is the timeline for the development program?     ANSWER: There is no specific schedule per se, however, it is estimated that the Basic would take 6-9 months, and Options 1 and 2 would take 12 to 24 months each.  If the contractor can deliver the goods in a schedule that is different than this, and th e schedule is well rationalized and explained, it will be considered. 9. QUESTION: Who is the prime contractor that we will have to work closely?     ANSWER: Netfires, LLC  http://www.spacedaily.com/news/missiles-04k.html 10. QUESTION: Is there a specific schedule for conduct of the program - start date and end date - or is the contracor to supply an independent schedule for the proposed program?     ANSWER: There is no specific scheduler per se, however, it is estimated that the Basic would take 6-9 months, and Options 1 and 2 would take 12 to 24 months each.  If the contractor can deliver the goods in a schedule that is different than this, and t he schedule is well rationalized and explained, it will be considered. 11.  QUESTION: Is there a funding profile by year available?     ANSWER: There is no funding profile per year available.  It would be up to the contractor to determine the level of effort and the resources required to complete the tasks. 12.  QUESTION: Would it be considered responsive to the BAA and eligible for potential award if it presented a plan to have security clearance reinstated for employees who have had it in the past along with a plan to install a lockdown facility and restric ted entry system?     ANSWER: The company that submits the proposal must have a secret facility clearance. The BAA specifies a secret clearance because some of the technologies used in the LAM missile are secret.  In addition, some of the technologies to be used in the engine development are considered classified and Military Critical Technology.  In order to i nsure adequate development of the propulsion system, and also insure its successful integration into the missile, a secret clearance is required. 13.  QUESTION: Would it be considered responsive to the BAA and eligible for potential award of a company teamed with another company that currently had Secret security clearance and maintained an internal firewall as appropriate.     ANSWER: Your welcome to team up with someone who is inputting a proposal 14.  QUESTION: Concerning security clearance, would an arrangement with a company having a facility clearance but no cleared personnel and another company with a cleared liaison at that facility be allowable for proposal security clearance requirement?     ANSWER: The contract requires SECRET access, the company would have to have a SECRET facility clearance and the personnel to support that effort so that a DD 254 could be attached to the contract. The process for a company to become cleared could take a really long time if they are not cleared. If a contractor is in doubt of their status, they should contact their cognizant Defense Security Service for review/guidance.  We cannot determine their status.    A company CEO or company official would have to have a clearance at the level of the facility clearance; Normally they would have to have a Security Officer who would oversee the receipt and storage of classified documents. 15.    QUESTION: To that end, two of us would like to meet with you and discuss whether there is any compatibility between our plans and your requirements.  While our team is not yet an 'established player' in the small engine market, I think you'll be imp ressed by the breadth of experience and innovative approaches we would bring to your program.     ANSWER: Your welcome to input a proposal or team up with someone who is inputting a proposal, but the government does not want to meet with you until the selction process is over. There appears to be compatibility between our requirements and your plan s.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, BRD, Leetown Science Center intends to award a non-competitive purchase order via request for written quotation to  YSI Incorporated in Yellow Springs, Ohio for the purchase of twelve 600XLM sondes, pH sensor, Dissolved oxygen sensor, vented field cable, adapter and membrane kit.  The YSI sonde was found to provide the most accurate measurements of dissolved oxygen, a critical water quality parameter for the protection of aquatic life.  The YSI sonde does not require an external stirrer to obtain accurate water quality measurements.  This is an important advantage, as our fieldwork will be conducted in waters with dense submerged vegetation where apparatuses such as stirrers are easily fouled or jammed by plant debris.  Further, YSI technology includes certain "fail-safe" features including a constant readout of "dissolved oxygen charge" to determine when this probe requires maintenance and a low-battery shut-ff capability.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notice must be submitted via e-mail to: mfritts@usgs.gov by 04/28/2004 or faxed to same at 703-648-7367.  No additional synopsis will be published.

<DESC>DESC: Requirement:  The Tank Automotive Chemical Command (TACOM-RI) is interested in contractors who have the technical knowledge and production capability to make Instant Thin Layer Chromatography (ITLC) candidate material.  The material currently u sed is unique.  Gelman now Pall is the only manufacturer of the ITLC material and their ITLC-SA material is the only material that performs to the militarys requirement for detection of blister agents in all of the environments.  The ITLC-SA material is cu rrently being used by the government for blister spots in the M256A1 Detector Kit.  The M256A1 Kit is a portable, expendable item capable of detecting and identifying hazardous concentrations of chemical agents.  THIS IS INTEREST ONLY AT THIS TIME.  The fo llowing characteristics are necessary for any candidate material for its replacement: 1.	The candidate material must perform passive sampling of air under normal conditions and during high temperatures (120 degrees F) at 50 percent relative humidity. 2.	The candidate material must support a colorimetric test using thermal activation at 103 degrees C and mild base. 3.	The candidate material must be a stand alone 1 inch disc that can stand packaging and rough handling and temperature between minus 25 degrees F and 120 degrees F. 4.	The candidate material must be able to be stored for 6 years without losing the ability to perform both passive sampling and colorimetric test conditions. 5.	The candidate material must function properly (agent and test blank) after the accelerated aging test: 90 degrees C for 48 hours while in the sealed sample plastic wrapper. 6.	The candidate material must have a color that does not interfere with colorimetric test, preferably white for the candidate material before and after accelerated aging; it should remain unaffected. 7.	The candidate material must not contain any impurities that would cause questionable test results. 8.	The candidate material must be able to collect an adequate sample for detection by a colorimetric test at 1mg/m3 of HD in air at the conditions given above.

<SUBJECT>A--Sources Sought for High-Energy Petawatt Laser Gratings Research and Development
<SOLNBR>DE-RI52-04NA11111
<RESPDATE>051904
<CONTACT>Aundra Richards, Contracting Officer, 510 637 1900, aundra.richards@oak.doe.gov;Martha Youngblood, Contract Specialist, 505 845-4268, myoungblood@doeal.gov
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is seeking to identify qualified private sector vendors capable of conducting research and development on damage resistant optical diffraction gratings.  Large-scale rectangular gratings of at least 40 by 50 centimeters with damage thresholds of several joules per square centimeter or greater are needed for development of high-energy petawatt (HEPW) lasers at NNSA?s inertial confinement fusion facilities.  Multi-layer dielectric (MLD) gratings appear to be the best candidates for satisfying these requirements. However, further process-related research and development is needed to improve current performance and ensure the required sizes can be manufactured. Areas of interest include but are not limited to advanced techniques to provide better uniformity of performance and cleanliness over large substrates, improved techniques to measure and assess impacts of contaminant levels, and coating techniques that allow gratings to better survive processing and vacuum use.  The improved processing techniques must be scalable to large grating sizes.  Interested vendors should possess demonstrated experience in manufacturing large-aperture MLD gratings using in-house equipment and expertise and be capable of producing one or more prototype gratings suitable for independent performance evaluation. REQUESTED INFORMATION:  Interested firms are asked to submit information that provides (1) company point of contact and address, (2) experience in manufacturing MLD gratings, (3)  facilities and technical capabilities to perform process-related R&D, and (4) the area of research the company feels it could pursue toward improving the damage resistance of its gratings. Responses are due by May 19, 2004 and shall be electronically submitted to:  Richard Thorpe at richards.thrope@nnsa.doe.gov and Martha Youngblood at myoungblood@doeal.gov DISCLAIMER:  This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued, nor will the government pay for the information solicited in this sources sought announcement. SMALL BUSINESS PREFERENCE:  NNSA is a strong advocate for the small business community and interested small businesses/lead teams and joint ventures that qualify as small businesses are especially encouraged to submit a response to this notice.

Scope of Work

The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, has a requirement for the study, evaluation, review, technical investigation and analysis of current and emerging knowledge and technology in selected areas of food processing, food safety, food security, and human health issues.  Three kinds of analysis/reviews shall be requested under the terms of this contract:  Comprehensive Reviews, Abbreviated Reviews, and Technical Investigation and Analysis for Potential Solutions.  The successful contractor shall be responsible for providing comprehensive reviews in the subject scientific areas and shall emphasize the essential components of an independent scientific review and evaluation.  The approach selected to address the topics identified by FDA for each Comprehensive Review shall emphasize the essential components of an independent scientific review and evaluation.  Every effort shall be made to minimize bias in the review of scientific information.  The final reports shall carefully document divergent scientific opinions.  The contractor shall prepare, within sixty days of initiation of each Comprehensive Review, a detailed Scientific Plan that describes a reasonable approach to address the scientific questions posed by FDA.  This plan shall take into account the complexities of the issues raised.  A project schedule shall be included in the Plan to indicate how the contractor shall organize the work to be performed for each Comprehensive Review.  In addition some abbreviated reviews are anticipated requiring rapid response and analysis and summaries of emerging issues in selected topics.   Abbreviated Reviews are intended to provide FDA with rapid analysis and summaries of emerging issues in the areas of food safety and health; they are normally completed within one to six months.  Requests for Abbreviated Reviews of selected topics shall be interspersed during the life of the contract.  The contractor shall prepare a written report summarizing the review and the conclusions or recommendations reached.  The basic types of Abbreviated Review activities that may be requested by FDA:  “Quick Response Actions on Request” shall address specific scientific issues such as the scientific merit of research proposals, new research, food processing and technological developments, and food safety and security concerns.  Predictive Response shall provide perspectives on issues in the field of food safety and security for approaching scientific areas of science evaluation, which are relevant to FDA’s mission.  Technical investigation and analysis of potential solutions to specific food safety or food security issues shall be requested under the terms of this contract.  These investigations involve a review of the food processing systems and activities and determination and validation of the preventive measures that can be applied by industry, particularly small and medium business, to eliminate or minimize a food safety hazard or food security vulnerability.  The contractor must have state-of-the-art knowledge on relevant scientific issues relating to food processing, food safety, food security, and human health.  The contractor must have a multidisciplinary scientific based organization that has experience and sufficient scientific expertise necessary to conduct research in the areas mentioned above.  It is anticipated that this requirement will result in an ID/IQ multi-year contract with task orders.   Many of the resulting task orders may be for research relating to bio-terrorism and or counter terrorism issues.   Because of the security issues involved in conducting this type of research it will be necessary to classify these projects as secret or top-secret.  It should be noted that any offeror interested in this procurement must possess the necessary security clearances.  Technical questions should be sent to the Contract Specialists e-mail address or fax number contained herein.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia is seeking all sources and information for fabrication of a Field Wiring Harness – Replacement (FWH-R) set. 

The USMC needs to have the ability to rapidly procure a substitute for the current Field Wiring Harness (FWH) set with a commercial based system in support of military operations. 

Current FWH sets, although meeting the need, are heavy, expensive and have a long lead-time procurement cycle. 

The Marine Corps Systems Command requires a system that is fully backward compatible with the current fielded FWH set.  

Technical data in the form of a parts list and a requirements document on the current system may be obtained by sending an email request to the below listed contracting officer.




The Marine Corps Systems Command can make available, upon request and under a bailment agreement, one set of the current FWH set, for a 30-day period of time, but conditional upon the vendor returning the FWH system back to the government with shipping pre-paid and in the as-provided condition.  Vendors seeking bailment of a current FWH set should send an e-mail request to the below listed contracting officer.  

The Marine Corps Systems Command envisions procurement of approximately 400 sets in Government Fiscal Year 2005 of the FWH-R set.

All parties interested in being considered for award should submit: (1) a description of their manufacturing capability, to include product brochures and statement of capabilities; (2) rough order magnitude cost for 400 complete FWH-R sets; (3) detailed material specification and data showing compliance with Government needs; (4) rough order cost estimate for fabrication of one prototype set of equipment using production fabrication techniques and representative tooling; (5) delivery timetable for completion and delivery of one prototype set; (6) delivery timetable for completion and delivery 400 production sets; (7) price breaks for quantity orders (above and below the quantity of 400); and (8) current GSA contract information regarding unit pricing and discounts and any existing federal purchase schedules the vendor is currently covered by or that can facilitate rapid purchase methods.

General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) is the preferred method for these supplies, both for the prototype and the production FWH-R sets. 

It is desired that FWH-R sets be offered for continuous sale with established price and delivery schedules.  

Multiple unit purchase discounts may be offered, but the vendor is encouraged to offer small lot purchase flexibility so that the USMC may purchase additional items on short notice.

Vendor information received on or before the response date listed above will be evaluated as potentially capable of fulfilling the Government’s requirements.  

Key criteria for vendor selection is timely response to purchase orders, ability to fabricate and deliver complete systems, and cable fabrication/molding expertise.

The Marine Corps Systems Command may  procure sample components from multiple vendors (cables, connectors, molded fittings) for evaluation.  Interested vendors should submit pricing and delivery information for one prototype FWH-R set assembly that the Marine Corps Systems Command can procure via credit card purchase or purchase order.  First item evaluation will validate form, fit function, and environmental compatibility with existing FWH systems.


This sources-sought / Request For Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request For Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire follow-on acquisition. 

No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information. 

The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort. If so included in any vendor correspondences, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. 

If the solution offered to the Marine Corps requirement is a proprietary solution, clearly state this in any submission of information. 

Responses to this RFI shall be mailed to Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: Gabrielle Trickett-GTES-EPS, 2200 Lester Ave, Quantico, VA 22134-6050 no later than 17 May, 2004. FEDEX or UPS deliveries should be sent to MARCORSYSCOM Material Management, Attn: Gabrielle Trickett-GTES-EPS, 2201A Willis St, Quantico, VA 22134-6050. Email address: trickettge@mcsc.usmc.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research Development & Engineering Command (RDECOM) in Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, is conducting a worldwide market survey for technical information for chemical agent detection kits with capabilities similar to the U.S. M256A1 Chemica l Agent Detector Kit. The selected detection kits will be used for testing against the M256A1 KitÃ¢Â€Â™s requirements. The current M256A1 Kit is a portable, expendable item capable of detecting and identifying low hazardous concentrations of chemical agent s: Blister, Blood, and Nerve.  In addition, the M256A1 Kit operating temperatures is between -32Ã‚Â°C and 49Ã‚Â°C.  The producer of the M256A1 KitÃ¢Â€Â™s Blister Spot filter paper will discontinue producing the paper in the future. The U.S. Army Integrated  Product Team recommended that the selected detection kits should be evaluated to help resolve this issue without affecting the readiness of the troops.  In order to prevent future readiness issues, the Army would like to pursue all available options. Eval uating the kits that are similar to the M256A1 kit is an excellent option to resolve this issue. At this point the team is considering evaluating the following five detection kits: Detector Kit Chemical Agent Residual Vapor No. 1 Mk.1 (RVD), R.A.C./83 Chem ical Agent Detection Kit, Chemical Detection Kit (CDK), Semi-Automatic Chemical Agent Detector (SCAD), DETEHIT. It is anticipated that the testing effort and evaluation will take about 3 months. This market survey is for information and planning purposes only. No solicitation document exists.  All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to th is request for information.

This request for information (RFI)/sources sought (SS) notice is for information and planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the US Army RDECOM.  The purpose of this RFI/SS is to identify pote ntial sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  US Army RDECOM does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for I2WDÃ¢Â€Â™s  use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of I2WDÃ¢Â€Â™s evaluation of the information received. PERFORMANCE OF THE LIGHTWEIGHT COUNTER MORTAR RADAR (LCMR) PRE-PRODUCTION MODEL: 3.0 REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Item Definition   The LCMR provides the ability to detect and locate mortar firing positions automatically by detecting and tracking the mortar shell and then backtracking to the weapon position. The LCMR provides continuous 360Ã‚Â° surveillance using an electronically scan ned antenna.  The LCMR has been designed to be compatible with airborne operations and can be deployed in a door bundle. The system can be assembled and disassembled quickly by two soldiers. When a mortar is detected, the LCMR sends a warning message indic ating a round is incoming.  After sufficient data are collected to enable an accurate weapon location, the weapons location is transmitted. 3.1.1 Functionality  The system has been tested for its ability to perform automatic detection, classification, and location of incoming mortars.  The system has demonstrated performance of these fu nctions  without any operator interaction, except for system initialization information.  LCMR has demonstrated the ability to: a. Perform radar functions (detect, track, etc.) b. Discriminate between mortars and other tracks c. Accurately locate weapon firing positions  d. Communicate information to operator e. Operate on battery power f. Meet Emplacement / Displacement times g. Meet Maintainability requirements (Fault detection, isolation, and repair). 3.1.2 System Configuration The radar system configuration is defined as consisting of the following:      a. Radar Antenna, Receiver Signal Processor Group      b. Battery / Power Supply Assemblies      c. Remote Control and Display unit (Pocket PC/PDA)      d. Mission Planning Computer      e. Mechanical Assembly (tripod, cover) 3.2 Characteristics 3.2.1 Target Type Primary targets for detection, location and classification are mortars.  Secondary targets for track and identification are light artillery and rockets. For the purpose of defining system performance, a target will be considered to be valid if it meets the  following criteria: Minimum muzzle velocity: 65 m/sec Maximum muzzle velocity: 320 m/sec The target must achieve a minimum height above the local terrain mask of 200 mils as observed from the radar and remain in the radarÃ¢Â€Â™s surveillance coverage for a minimum of 2 seconds. 3.2.2 Location Range LCMR is capable of locating 81 mm mortars to the specified accuracy from 1 km to 5km and 120 mm mortars to the specified accuracy from 1 km to 6 km. 3.2.3 Azimuth Coverage The radar azimuth coverage is 360Ã‚Â°.  The system is capable, via operatorÃ¢Â€Â™s PDA , of setting the azimuth scan between 90Ã‚Â° and 360Ã‚Â°.   3.2.4 Probability of Location   Probability of location is defined as the probability of detecting and computing the point of origin of in-flight projectiles. For an individual weapon firing a single round in a benign non-jamming environment, the probability of location has been demonstrated to exceed 85% averaged over all weapon firing azimuths and weapon ranges within the required location range of the radar. 3.2.5 Location Accuracy   LCMR has demonstrated Target Location Errors (TLE) of better than 100 m (50% CEP) for the maximum specified location range on each target type, averaged over all weapon firing azimuths and weapon ranges within the required location range of the radar.  3.2.6 Target Track Capacity   The radar  is capable of maintaining track on 20 simultaneous in-flight projectiles originating from separate sites randomly distributed in the coverage area of the radar.  The probability of location under these conditions is greater than 85%.  When addit ional projectiles are being tracked simultaneously, the probability of locating a new weapon firing may degrade. 3.2.7 In-bound/Out-bound Mode of Operation The radar  performs friendly (out-bound) projectile impact prediction and hostile (in-bound) weapon location and projectile impact point prediction. The radar is capable of simultaneous in-bound/out-bound operation.   3.2.8 Hostile Projectile Impact Prediction   The projectile impact point  is predicted.  (No accuracy requirement) 3.2.9 False Location Rate The radar has demonstrated a false location rate no more than one (1) per six (6) hours over a 24 hour day/night cycle. A false location is defined as an indication by the radar that an in-flight projectile has been detected and a firing point located when , in fact, no projectile has been fired.  This performance was achieved in a benign (no local aircraft activity within 5 km) environment. Distant (less than 5km) aircraft have displayed no tendency to cause false locations. 3.2.10 Operation 3.2.10.1 Height Correction The radar system accepts Level 1 DTED data and automatically performs height correction. 3.2.10.2 Target Classification  The radar system , as evidenced from demon strated PL, is able to discriminate mortars from aircraft targets. 3.2.10.3 Zonal Control.   The LCMR operator may designate zones in which the operation of the radar is restricted.  A minimum of ten (10) zones of each type is supported.   The following types of zonal operation are available:      a. ATIZ Ã¢Â€Â“ Artillery Target Intelligence Zones       b. Censor Zones.        c. Call for Fire Zones:       d. Critical Friendly zones:  The zones are defined in accordance with existing conventions. 3.3 Remote Control and Display Unit (RCDU) The radar is capable of communicating with a Personnel Digital Assistant (PDA)-class computer over a wireless radio link to a distance of 1000 m.  The RDCU supports all functions necessary to initialize and operate the radar. The RDCU also provides system status, battery status and Built-In-Test information to the operator. 3.3.1 Communication Interface The LCMR pre-production system communicates only with its wireless PDA or via Ethernet. 3.3.2 Prime Power Prime power required is approximately 300 watts.  The radar is capable of being powered by batteries for a minimum period of three (3) hours without battery replacement. (demonstrated using six (6) BA-5590 batteries)  The system is also be capable of being  powered using standard 24 volt DC vehicle power and adaptable to AC power, 85VAC Ã¢Â€Â“ 240VAC, 40Hz Ã¢Â€Â“ 400Hz.  3.3.3 Weight Total system weight is weight is less than 120 lbs including any one of the following power sources/considerations:    - Battery container (battery weight not included in weight budget)    - vehicle DC adapter cable    -  AC power supply 3.4 Emplacement and March Order System assembly and initialization by a two person crew has been demonstrated in less than 20 minutes. The system can be disassembled and readied for transport by the same crew in 3 minutes. 3.4.1 System Leveling The radar has an integrated leveling system that allows the system to meet its performance requirements on terrain with a 10Ã‚Â° slope.  3.4.2 Orientation The radar is capable of automatically determining azimuth orientation with the input of 2 surveyed points. The system is also capable of accepting AZ orientation information from an external source. 3.5 Transportability The system is packed into two (2) transport cases that allow for various Joint SOF and conventional Army methods for transport and delivery into the operational theater.  3.5.1 Air-Drop N/A 3.5.2 Door Bundle The transport cases can be safely delivered using standard door bundle techniques.  3.5.3 Vehicle Mounting N/A 3.5.4 Waterproof Container N/A 3.6 Environment 3.7 Operating Environment The radar system is able to operate in various environmental conditions found throughout the world as described: 3.7.1 Operating Temperature The system has been successfully tested to operate with external temperatures between -25Ã‚Â° F and +120Ã‚Â° F 3.7.2 Storage Temperature The system has been successfully tested at storage temperatures between -40Ã‚Â° F and +160Ã‚Â° F 3.7.3 Rain   The system has demonstrated operation during wind driven rainfall at rates up to one inch per hour with no degradation in performance.  3.7.4 Dust.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is conducting a market investigation to identify possible sources of corrosion preventative compounds (CPCs) or rust inhibitors for application in the Army Corrosion Service Centers (CCS). The Operational Requi rements Document for the CPCs  (FCS), dated 25 Nov 02, indicates that corrosion must be reduced by 30%, either in quantity or severity, over an untreated surface. Additionally, treatment with CPCs must not adversely impact the performance of any military c oatings.  Candidates will be tested over coated and uncoated steel, aluminum and magnesium.  Samples will be exposed to accelerated cyclic corrosion and constant salt fog environments. The vendor will supply technical support in the form of application pro cedures and MSDSs prior to the test phase. It is anticipated that the integration effort will take four months and the test effort will take five months. The CPC selected must already be in production to allow for the above integration/test effort as detai led above. This market survey is for information purposes only; this is not a Request for Quotations. No solicitation document exists. All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. Responses may be sen t via email to RMAC-Adelphi@arl.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>99--Jade High Performance LWIR Thermal Imaging and Measurement System and Accessories
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Electrophysics Fairfield, VA.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Redstone Technical Test Center has a requirement for the acquisition of one Jade High Performance LWIR Thermal Imaging and Measurement System and accessories.  The estimated total value of this project is $165,000.  The Field Signature Group (FSG) of RTTC utilizes radiometric cameras in support of missile systems for building 3D models, Delta-T measurements, and airborne data collections. The camera must be field portable and self- contained except for the PCI based image acquisition card located in a PC; i.e. a separate camera head and electronics box is not acceptable due to the use of this camera in a mobile environment. The camera must also be a closed cycle self contained focal plane array (FPA) system. It cannot be externally cooled through the use of liquid nitrogen. The FPA must be at least 320 x 256 HgCdTe (MCT) based detector with a minimum response of 8-9.3 A system with. a quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP) does not meet the need for short integration times necessary to prevent target motion from blurring the image while maintaining required thermal sensitivity. The low quantum efficiency (QE) of QWIP, typically 10-20%, of other systems is not acceptable. This low QE leads directly to longer integration time. The MCT detector has a QE of 60-70% at its operating temperature. Operating at a higher temperature will typically decrease the strain on the cooler and therefore lengthen the life of the camera system. RTTC has determined that the equipment required by is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. Thorough market surveys indicate that this LWIR system is the only system that will meet environmental considerations and the data collection requirements to support the required test conduct. Award to a vendor other than Electrophysics would result in the acquisition of substandard equipment that will not meet mission requirements. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST April 30, 2004, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS A LICENSEE TO FUND RESEARCH AND COMMERCIALIZE A DEVICE USING EXPANDING SHAPED MEMORY POLYMER FOR TREATING ANEURYSMS AND ARTERIAL-VENOUS MALFORMATIONS
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS A LICENSEE TO FUND RESEARCH AND COMMERCIALIZE A DEVICE USING EXPANDING SHAPED MEMORY POLYMER FOR TREATING ANEURYSMS AND ARTERIAL-VENOUS MALFORMATIONS

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to use Expanding Shaped Memory Polymer (SMP) for the purpose of treating aneurysms and arterial-venous malformations (AVMs).

The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy is seeking industrial partners willing engage in cooperative research (CRADA) and license the technology for using SMP foam to treat aneurysms and AVMs.  The final goal of this process is the commercialization of this technology by the CRADA partner.

Shaped Memory Polymer (SMP) refers to a polymer which displays shape memory behavior, which means they can be formed into a primary shape, subsequently deformed into a stable secondary shape, and then controllably actuated to recover their primary shape.    The LLNL technology uses a secondary shape, which can pass through the arteries, and then uses a laser based photothermal system to heat the SMP, which causes the SMP to recover to its primary shape and expand to fill the cavity caused by the aneurysm or AVM.   Therefore, this device acts like an inflatable  “foam plug” which a doctor can maneuver through body before deploying in the appropriate place to plug an aneurysm or AVM.

Researchers at LLNL have demonstrated the basic principal for this device, but are still in the process of perfecting the device’s operation.   The device would also require medical trials before coming to market since the SMP would remain permanently in the patient.   For this reason, LLNL would like to find a CRADA partner to help finish the research necessary to make this a practical device.   The CRADA partner would also assume this responsibility for commercializing the device, which would include performing human trials and obtaining FDA approval.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Shaped Memory Polymer (SMP) for the purpose of treating aneurysms and arterial-venous malformations (AVMs) should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

	P.O. Box 808, L-795

	Attention:  FBO 69-04
Please provide your written statement within thrity (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Shaped Memory Polymer (SMP) for the purpose of treating aneurysms and arterial-venous malformations (AVMs).

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to use Shaped Memory Polymer (SMP) to release Embolic Coils for the purpose of treating aneurysms and arterial-venous malformations (AVMs).

LLNL has developed the technology for using Shaped Memory Polymer SMP to release embolic coils.  SMP refers to a polymer which displays shape memory behavior, which means they can be formed into a primary shape, subsequently deformed into a stable secondary shape, and then controllably actuated to recover their primary shape.  The LLNL technology uses a secondary shape, which holds the coils, and then uses a laser based photothermal system to heat the SMP, which causes the SMP to recover to its primary shape and release the embolic coils.  LLNL researchers have demonstrated embolic coil release times of under 1 second using this SMP technology.  This fast release time helps to minimize the fluoroscopy radiation exposure necessary to monitor the procedure and complications resulting from extended operating time.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Shaped Memory Polymer (SMP) to release Embolic Coils should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking industrial partners willing engage in cooperative research (CRADA) and license the technology for using SMP to treat ischemic strokes.  The final goal of this process is the commercialization of this technology by the CRADA partner.

Shaped Memory Polymer (SMP) refers to a polymer which displays shape memory behavior, which means they can be formed into a primary shape, subsequently deformed into a stable secondary shape, and then controllably actuated to recover their primary shape.    The LLNL technology uses a secondary shape that can pass through the arteries and then poke through the blood clot causing the ischemic stroke.  Then, the LLNL technology uses a laser based photothermal (or other thermal) system to heat the SMP, which causes the SMP to recover to its primary shape.  The primary shape is one that grabs the blood clot from both sides.   Once the SMP device grabs the clot, it can be safely removed from the body.

LLNL currently has government funding to work on this project, and actively working on finalizing the final configuration of the “grabbing” shape, characterizing the SMP material properties, and testing the biocompatibility of SMP.   LLNL believes the technology is sufficiently mature to engage a commercial partner to commercialize the device.   LLNL currently intends to finish the various SMP studies, finalize the design, and test the device in animals.   LLNL wants the involvement of a commercial partner at this stage to help design a device that will be accepted in medical marketplace.   The commercial partner would also have the primary responsibility for taking this device through human clinical trials and obtaining FDA approval.

SCOPE: Contractor will conduct research into cochlear biochemical responses to intense noise exposures in support of funded investigations under the ONR Military Operational Medicine program. This program encompasses research into developing countermeasures for the prevention of tissue/organ damage prior to exposures to high-energy sources (loud sounds) and to develop methods for rescue and treatment after exposure to exotic energy sources. This work entails performing a series of experiments for two years to: (1) understand the cochlear intracellular biochemical response to damaging sound energy, (2) to identify and delineate the reactions involved with glutathione metabolism and reactive oxygen molecules (ROM) and free radicals (FR) produced by oxidative stress in response to acoustic over-exposure, and (3) utilize our recent antioxidant technology to increase hair cell glutathione or antioxidant defenses to reduce the formation of and damage caused by FRs and ROM molecules in order to prevent hair cell damage or death caused by traumatic noise. 	The first year encompasses three experiments (A, B and C). Experiment A involves studying groups of chinchillas under no noise conditions to characterize baseline biochemical and metabolic responses of the auditory hair cells.  Experiment B entails exposing the same number of animals, first to one hour of no noise for baseline measurements and then for four hours of continuous noise at 105 dB SPL octave band noise centered at 4 kHz.  In Experiment C animals will again undergo one hour of baseline measures (no noise) then be noise-exposed for four hours but prior to noise exposure a glutamate antagonist will be administered to study its capability to reduce perilymphatic glutamate levels and counteract excitotoxicity. The treatment animals will be compared to saline injected noise-exposed animals, which will serve as controls.  In each experiment cochlear perilymph fluid will be sampled using micro dialysis technology.  Perilymphatic samples are taken at a rate of 1mL per minute giving three 20 mL specimens per hour. As control reference for perilymphatic metabolism and to also monitor the stress level of the whole animal, a sample of brain and blood plasma will be taken and measured for the same metabolites.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

All experiments, the contractor will receive shipments of frozen blood plasma, brain tissue and perilymphatic samples as collected by micro dialysis sampling.  After careful calibration of equipment, quantification of the following metabolites: glutamate, cysteine, reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione, malendialdehyde and dihydroxybenzoate will be measured from each perilymphatic aliquot and from each brain and plasma specimen.  
The contractor will assess the biochemical events taking place in the cochlea during quiet conditions and then following damaging sound exposure utilizing high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).  This study will elucidate the cellular biochemical response of hair cells to noise-induced damage and investigate the capability of glutathione enhancing and mitochrondrial protectants to prevent noise-induced cell death (apoptosis).  The brain tissue and blood plasma samples will be used for controls and to determine the effect of the noise stress on the state of the animal.
Duties
The contractor shall perform a full range of research procedures, within the scope of his training and experience, on site using Baylor University Medical Center furnished facilities, supplies and equipment. Workload occurs as a result of scheduled and unscheduled requirements for research activities.

EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FAR 52.212-2) (JAN 1999)  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered (See FAR 2.101, Best Value). The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers, with consideration given to the factors of past performance, proposed technical merit, and price.  This procurement shall be conducted utilizing Best Value Selection (BVS), which seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the offerors and the Government. BVS takes advantage of the lower complexity of simplified acquisition procurements and predefines the value characteristics which will serve as the discriminators among offers. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts) . However, the Government will consider awarding to an offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value. Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an offeror whose proposal has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other proposals warrant doing so.  The statement of work included serves as the Government's baseline requirements. Those offers determined to meet the baseline requirements will be judged against these value characteristics listed below which establish what the Government considers to be valuable in an offer beyond the baseline requirements. The value characteristics are performance based and permit selection of the offer, which provides better results for a reasonable increase in price. All these factors combined are approximately equal to cost or price. On those value characteristics the offeror chooses to provide, adequate information should be submitted to permit proper evaluation.  The following value characteristics are applicable to this procurement: 1. Relevant qualifications, experience and past performance on similar custom calorimeter projects of the personnel proposed to manage this order and design the unique system for NASA Johnson. 2. Superior company resources to ensure high production quality and past performance of the company with similar battery calorimeter projects. 3. Detailed written proposal that NASA can evaluate to determine how well it meets or exceeds the requirement of the SOW and Specification. Most important requirements to exceed are the Stability (1.1.2), Resolution and Accuracy (1.1.3), Custom Insert (1.1.4), Operating Temperature Range (1.3.1), Transition Time (1.3.5) of the SOW, and Delivery time (1.5). The attached Statement of Work (SOW) and Specification is applicable to this procurement. Selection and award will be made to that offeror whose offer will be most advantageous to the Government, with consideration given to the factors of proposed technical merit, price, and past performance. It is critical that offerors provide adequate detail to allow evaluation of their offer.  (SEE FAR 52.212-1(b)).    Offerors must include completed copies of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their offer. These may be obtained via the internet at URL:		     http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/eps/Templates/Commercial_Greater_Than_25K.doc 		   . These representations and certifications will be incorporated by reference in any resultant contract. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the following Internet site for the release of solicitation amendments (if any):		 http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73		.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of this combination synopsis/solicitation and amendments (if any).

The associated North American Classification System (NAICS) code is 443120.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.   The USPTO intends to establish Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with small businesses including HUBZone and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned businesses.  The USPTO reserves the right to compete individual requirements, with the selected HUBZone or Service Disabled Veteran-owned businesses to accomplish its socio-economic goals.  17(v).  The initial BPAs will be issued for a period of 2 years, with 3, 1-year option periods to renew.  The USPTO reserves the right to cancel any company’s BPA for any reason including poor performance and/or if the company’s prices are determined to be no longer competitive.  In addition, the USPTO may solicit additional companies at any time to replace or increase existing BPAs to fulfill the USPTO’s requirements. 17(vi). The Government is seeking a one-stop shopping vehicle, which offers a wide array of computer hardware and software products to include computer hardware, software and licenses, and maintenance that is found under Schedule 70 – General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services.

The established BPAs will replace most BPAs that are currently registered in the USPTO’s Internet Purchasing Application (IPA), IT Product and Services Category.  As requirements occur, the USPTO will compete the actions among BPA holders.  Exact requirements are not known at this time and there is no guarantee of requirements.

As used in this clause- Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet,
Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record Active. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company Telephone Number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation
to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items under the Test Program at FAR Subpart 13.5 prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ) and will follow Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  Responses are requested pursuant to this announcement.  All responses shall reference Solicitation PR 140P0440406.  This solicitation incorporates all of the applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 01-22, as if stated in full text, as well as the terms and conditions of FAR 52-212-1.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) anticipates awarding a firm fixed price purchase order as a result of this solicitation.  This procurement is 100% set aside for small business.  The North American Industrial Classification Code System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 512110.  For this NAICS a small business is not to exceed $25 Million average annual revenues. 2. BACKGROUND.  The Office of Public Affairs (OPA) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has as part of its mission the dissemination of information to the public concerning patents, trademarks, and related information.  The Foreign Agriculture Service (FAS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has identified a need for a video explaining the U.S. position on geographical indications (GIs).  The video will be used in all FAS posts, particularly in emerging foreign markets, such as Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, China, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Venezuela. The USPTO has both expertise in trademark matters and experience in producing videos of this general nature and has therefore agreed to produce such a video.  3. PURPOSE.  The purpose of this solicitation and the resultant commercial contract is to establish a source of supply for the production of a video on the U.S. system for protecting geographical indications (GIs) through our trademark system.  The video will be used by FAS posts to explain the U.S. position on GIs and to offer an alternative to reopening the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs).  4. SCOPE OF WORK.  4.1 Under the scope of this requirement the contractor shall provide pre-production and post-production services to create a 15-20 minute video on the U.S. system for protecting GIs through our trademark system.  This color video shall be closed captioned (English) utilizing a script provided by the USPTO.  The video shall be produced in two versions; one each in English (U.S.) and Spanish.  The above specifications will be reviewed and approved by Richard Maulsby, Director of Public Affairs, USPTO.  4.2 The color video may consist of still photos, stock photos, stock footage, and original footage shot in and around the USPTO, Washington, D.C., and the Metro area.  The contractor shall provide cameras, lighting, and sound to the video, and obtain all necessary stock stills or footage.  The contractor will be responsible for obtaining all releases from any persons on camera, securing any copyright or trademark permissions as needed, and paying any fees as required. 4.3 The contractor will produce a rough-cut with scratch track for review and approval by the USPTO, specifically, Richard Maulsby.  Until such time as the contractor has received written approval, a final video shall not be produced.  Whatever changes necessary to the rough-cut with scratch track will be made by the contractor, with no additional cost the Government, and be resubmitted for approval.  4.4 Upon approval of the final video by the USPTO, the contractor shall provide one Beta SP master and three copies of the video.  The final video shall contain a version in English and a version in Spanish.  The final production shall be placed on CD-ROM master for duplication.  4.5 Delivery of the final product is due by June 1, 2004. 5. REQUIREMENTS. 5.1 The contractor must have the appropriate equipment or access to facilities to product the video and create video copies. 5.2 The contractor will be responsible for overseeing and paying any subcontractors needed to fulfill all the requirements of the Statement of Work. 5.3 The contractor should never do work that is not listed in this Statement of Work before contacting USPTO’s Contracting Officer, Brendon J. Johnson, for approval.  He can be reached at (703) 305-8146.  5.4 After completion of the video, the contractor should submit invoices to the USPTO, Office of U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, Office of Finance, Mail Stop 17, P.O. Box 1450, Arlington, VA  22313-1450. 5.5 The USPTO retains all rights to distribution as a Government entity in which no copyright is held.  INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS AND EVALUATION CRITERIA.  In evaluating responses to this requirement, the USPTO will select the solution that offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  In making this selection, the USPTO is more interested in obtaining quality performance and innovative approaches in the production of stimulating and interesting videos, rather than making an award at the lowest price.  In responding to this announcement respondents shall provide, all pricing information broken down by project/video and associated costs within each project video product, relevant past performance information, references from past performance and successful projects and samples of previous work that demonstrate the following:  1) Use of multi-layered images and graphic techniques.  2) Effective use of music to complement the messages presented. 3) Creative use of wipes, fades and any other creative visual transitions. 4) Professional level lighting and sound quality 5) Highly technical visual representations.  In addition to a completed quotation and technical package, provide your Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, Tax Identification Number (TIN) and a signed Offeror Representation and Certifications as required under FAR 52.212-3.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment (# 2) is to post the questions and answers that have asked by various contractors so far. All contractors are encouraged to be present at the site visit mentioned in amendment # 1 as more questions will be asked and answered at said site visit. 

Q: What size is the room? The room is 38'x31'.

Q: Any VTC in the room? There is no teleconferencing..

Q: Do you have any other information regarding the 10.4" color touch
panel control system requirements? (i.e.wired vs. wireless, rack mount or table top, preview video and computer etc).

Q: Is the lectern to be provided by the Contractor, or does one exist?  
Yes, per previous requirements
 
Q:  Will the lectern have a permanent location, and is there an appropriate cable path in place for the control touch panel, KVM interface, and potential laptop computer  interface?  (This could also affect the next question regarding the number of sources - if the lectern will have multiple locations, and the need for a computer interface, an 8x4 matrix would not have enough inputs.)  Yes it will stay in one place, even though it won't be bolted to the floor.  It will, though, be restricted by the wires bound together in either a cable or running through a conduit, which will likely be attached to the wall.
 
Q: Assuming the need for a laptop input at the lectern, and that the lectern will have a permanent location, this would fully load the input side of the Matrix Switcher (6 permanent computers + 1 Combination VHS/DVD/CATV Tuner + 1 Aux Computer input).  This would not allow for any future expansion without replacing the Matrix Switcher.  Am I making correct assumptions?  If not, please clarify the number of computers that will be used initially, and the number of "future" computers.  We want eight inputs.
 
Q: Similarly, what type of computers will need to be housed in the equipment rack?  Also, will there be a dedicated monitor with each? This will help to determine the amount of space required to be allocated to the OFE computers within the equipment rack. We are currently planning on 2 classified and 2 unclassified computers feeding the matrix, so I guess that's what will be housed in the rack.  Since classified and unclassified computers have to be at least 1 meter apart, this will probably drive some design issue.  I don't know what "OFE" means.
 
Q: Does the combination VCR/DVD/CATV tuner need to be scaled to the native resolution of the projectors?  I assume that it does, as otherwise the 8x4 RGBHV Matrix Switcher would not be appropriate – it would need to be an 8x8 Matrix to accommodate the specified functionality.  If you mean, do I want the projectors to show the  VCR/DVD/CATV output, the answer is "yes."  If you mean something, please translate into terms us mere mortals can comprehend.  By the way, we don't want some weirdly distorted TV picture to meet the native resolution of the projectors.
 
Q:Do you require GSA pricing, or is this to be Open Market pricing? Open market pricing is requested, however companies may submit GSA pricing. 

Q: Do you want to be able to control the system from the lectern and the
corner office simultaneously?  No

Q: What is the distance from the floor to the T-bar and what is the distance
from T-bar to the structure?  What is a T-bar?  I have called several folks on base, none of which know either.

Q:  What is the structure made of?  Dry wall, metal studs, cinder block, drop ceiling and metal roof.

Q:  Do you want 3000 to 3500 ansi lumens or 4000 ansi lumens. ansi lumens and
brightness are the same thing. Can you elaborate?  4000, as lights will be on while briefing

Q: Will you require us to provide you a DVD, VHS, Computer, and the two wall
mounted speakers?  Contractor supplies DVD, VHS, tv tuner, speaker system

Q: Can you clarify the 2 user x 8 port kvm with the cat5  remote user receiver. Does this mean that you would like 1 or both of the computers potentially being displayed to be remotely controllable?  yes

Q:  Do you want us to do the entire installation? Absolutely yes, to include training. 

Q: What is the voltage rating of the AV systems?  110V

Q: What is the continuous current rating of the AV systems?  Depends on the equipment that is installed

Q: What is the connection method (i.e. hard-wire, barrier strip, special connector)?
Common 110 plugs

Q: What is quantity required?  Be more specific

Q: Could you make available some pictures and/or a drawing or sketch of the room?
Yes, what is you fax #?

Q: Is the room currently rated for classified meetings?  Yes

Q: Is there existing Black (secure filtered) power available?  No

Q: Are there multiple rooms or just one room where the equipment is to be installed?  
Just one

Q: It is unclear and seems like there are descriptions about two kinds of video wall displays with 2 different resolution requirements 3000-3500 and 4000 lumens.  Can you shed some light on this please?  3 screens, all with same 4000 lumens
