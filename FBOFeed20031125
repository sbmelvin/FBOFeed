<DESC>NASA/HQ plans to issue a Request for Offer(RFO)to complete a scholarly book-length manuscript on the history of NASA's Planetary Protection Efforts. The NASA History Office will administer this project and manage professional review and oversight of the final publication of the work.  The book should focus on the time period since NASA’s inception in 1958 with some background discussion of antecedent thoughts and efforts.  The NASA History Division will administer this project jointly with the Office of Space Science.  The goal of this research project is to produce a roughly 400-page manuscript history of the views of scientists, engineers, policymakers, enthusiasts, and the general public regarding planetary protection. While focusing on NASA, this manuscript should also examine efforts by other countries and international organizations.  The finished manuscript is to be delivered within three years and must reflect extensive research of NASA records, scientific journals, and the records of other relevant government agencies (for example, the Smithsonian Institution, the Department of Defense, personal paper collections, and private company archives).  The contractor should use oral history interviews as appropriate to augment written records as source material for this book. The contractor should transcribe the most significant oral histories and deliver them to the NASA History Office to make part of its Historical Reference Collection.  All of the research materials, including interview tapes and transcripts, collected during the project will be archived with the NASA History Division, forming a coherent collection other researchers can use for future histories. Work Location: Work shall be performed at the contractor facility and at NASA Headquarters and relevant Field Centers such as the Ames Research Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, and Langley Research Center.  The contractor shall carry out the project using contractor office space, equipment, and supplies; however, workspace and photocopying will be made available to the investigator when researching in NASA facilities.   Period of Performance and Contract Type: The period of peformance for this contract includes a 12 month base period and two 12 month option periods, not to exceed 36 months after contract award. NASA intends to award a firm-fixed price contract. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR part 12. The NAIS Code is 711510.  The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9. The Government is planning to conduct a full and open competition utilizing NASA's Midrange Procurement Procedures(NASA FAR Supplement 1871). In the event two or more small businesses submit capability statements that demonstrate their ability to successfully perform the efforts, the Government may convert this effort to a small business set aside. Please submit your capabilities statement no later than December 10, 2003 to Alpana Jenne at: Alpana.K.Jenne@nasa.gov. The anticipated release date of the Request For Offer 04-HBG-001 is on or about December 12,2003 with an anticipated proposal due date of on or about January 12,2004.

The work will include continuation of the on-line web-based system that allows access to the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) data.  iEngineering provides a service that allows users to access and download the LTPP data.  The system will be maintained and updated for 6 additional months.  iEngineering is the only known source because they developed this system, therefore, they are the only source that can update and maintain it as required.  This is a 6-month time extension.  The FHWA contact for this requirement is Michael Rosenstiehl, telephone number 708-283-3513.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about December 12, 2003.

<DESC>This is a notice of contract action (NOCA) to advise all potential offerors that a Request for Quote (RFQ)is anticipated to be issued on 20 Nov 2003 as a Full and Open Competition requirement for:  The Engineering and Technical Support Branch of the Air Force Safety Center currently supports two Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) demonstration projects.  These projects collect flight data recorder downloads and processes them through specialized computer software to uncover mishap precursors-- trends and deviations from standard procedures and parameters.  The analysis products are then available as guidance to operations, training, maintenance, safety, R&D, and design decisions 
Recent funding actions direct an expansion of the current demonstration programs and deployment of MFOQA into other airframes. Each additional airframe project requires tailoring to individual aircraft configuration and missions.  A multi-phase approach to the growth of MFOQA within the Air Force includes:
a.	Concept Validation-Determine MFOQA resource and process requirements.
b.	Development and Demonstration-Placement of resources and development of analyses.
c.	Targeted Analyses Development-Refinement of analyses, MAJCOM transition, and automatic report generation.
d.	Operational Integration.

The objectives of this task are to demonstrate long-range safety benefits of MFOQA programs by developing and integrating mishap precursor detection and mitigation tools into USAF aerial operations, and to reveal to the Major Commands the long-term value of MFOQA programs through additional applications in operations, training, logistics, acquisition, and maintenance.

Scope of Work.  This task involves validating the MFOQA concept throughout the Air Force, for a variety of aircraft configurations and missions.  Software enabling the MFOQA concept shall be developed, which will permit the analyst to identify standard procedures, deviations from standard procedures and parameter exceedances (often called the event set), perform statistical analyses, and to animate the flight data.  Flight data analysis products shall be presented to AFSC and the Major Commands, and used to keep the Air Force abreast of current safety, operational, training and maintenance trends in its flying community.  Regular communication between the contractor and Air Force personnel shall ensure current areas of interest, especially safety, operations, training and maintenance, are examined.  Monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual reports shall ensure the data is distributed to the greatest population possible.  An overall program manager will facilitate communication between the Air Force and the contractor(s), and will coordinate all software and hardware needs.  The technical supervisor will have the skills necessary to manage several large and perhaps varied databases and troubleshoot a variety of data analysis programs.  Software vendors may vary from program phase to program phase, and between aircraft.

IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBIITY TO MONITOR THE INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS. The Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health is seeking support for the CCR intramural clinical research program.  The mission of CCR is to reduce the burden of cancer through exploration, discovery, and translation.  CCR scientists conduct innovative basic and clinical research aimed at discovering the causes and mechanisms of cancer to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer and other diseases.  CCR clinical trials are directed toward establishing the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutics or therapeutic regimes and directly comparing these promising novel approaches to standard therapies.  To support its clinical research portfolio, the CCR requires an organization with the capability to provide clinical data management services, as well as related database support and adaptation services.  This organization must have a dynamic, comprehensive knowledge of the practical and regulatory issues fundamental to the conduct of clinical research and clinical trials under Good Clinical Practices standards and the ability to respond, rapidly and proactively, to changing regulatory and practical requirements.  The primary objective of this contract is to provide comprehensive data management support to the CCR intramural clinical trials program.  This includes all data management functions, quality assurance and quality control, quality enhancements, standardized and professional development training, as well as the maintenance and enhancement of the newly adopted clinical database and maintenance of legacy systems functions. In addition, the organization should have demonstrated capability to perform quality assurance, including monitoring and training, and medical record auditing and trial oversight using standard operating procedures at a limited number of extramural sites, as required by the CCR.  The Government anticipates the award of one Performance Based Award Fee, cost-reimbursement completion contract, over a seven year period ( three base years, and 4 option years), under NAICS Code 541710.  The anticipated contract shall be awarded on a negotiated competitive basis to an eligible business concern included in one of the following two (2) cascading preference tiers, provided that adequate competition is received and award can be made at fair market price (see Definition at FAR Part 19).  Adequate competition is defined as: the receipt of at least two (2) competitive proposals in a tier from companies that are qualified.  Evaluation preference is to be applied in the following manner:  First Tier Competition:  This Tier is defined by competition among eligible small business concerns providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort. In the event that competition and price requirements cannot be met under the First Tier Competition, and there is only one technically qualified firm offering a fair market price, then the competition for this Tier will stop.  However, the one qualified firm from this Tier will become eligible to compete in the Second Tier Competition, as defined below.  Second  Tier Competition: This Tier is defined as an unrestricted, full and open competition with selection of an awardee based upon a best value determination pursuant to FAR 15.3.  The solicitation will be available on or about  December 15, 2003 with a due date for proposals of  January 30, 2004. This is a re-competition of Contract No. NO2-RC-91004, awarded to the Orkand Corporation.

TITLE:  Wireless Cyber-Operations
ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement 
FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 04-04-IFKA
CFDA Number: n/a 
DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 04 should be submitted by 1 Mar 04; FY 05 by 30 Mar 05; and FY 06 by 30 Mar 06.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 May 06, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

DESCRIPTION:  Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)/IF, is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase AFRL/IF's knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of  Wireless Cyber-Operations, including both Information Assurance and techniques for a timely response to wireless intrusion attempts. Solutions to basic research and engineering problems using innovative approaches are sought. The scope of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of requirements which includes novel techniques at each of the layers of the OSI model, with a focus on intrusion detection and response techniques.  AFRL/IF requires solutions sufficient to meet the needs of rapidly deployable wireless networks for use by the military and in support of Homeland Security. These networks will contain both commercial wireless and software radio systems in the mid to late 2000s time period.

SCOPE:  The areas of interest include: 1) Development of integrated multi-layer techniques for the protection of  mobile, ad-hoc wireless information networks, detection of attacks on them, and the reaction of the network nodes to these attacks once they have been detected.; 2) The broad range of physical, data link and network layer techniques to assure the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of wireless networks consisting of commercial and DoD specific assets; 3)  Development of techniques for detecting intrusions into wireless networks and responding to those intrusions in a timely fashion,  4) The broad range of innovative software radio techniques that could provide assured communications; 5) Hardware prototyping and proof-of-concept development/demonstration systems.  Specific technology and support programs include: 1) Network layer protocols to utilize, secure, and connect to commercial wireless networks, and that assure security of routing updates and are resistant to spoofing; 2) Digital and Physical Layer Watermarking for authentication of data; 3) Wireless Intrusion Detection and Response techniques; 4) Responsive, adaptive Link Control/Authentication Techniques;  5) Application of new high-efficiency spread spectrum waveforms and interference mitigation algorithms to Mobile Radio Multiple Access networked systems to provide "on-demand' Anti-Jam/Low Probability of Intercept (AJ/LPI) capability; emphasis is placed on the integration and insertion of advanced wireless information assurance technologies into existing and emerging networking infrastructures and systems and the extension of such capabilities into a larger network. Deliverables will be technical reports and, when appropriate, demonstrations.

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

The anticipated AFRL/IF funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 04 - $200K; FY 05 - $200K; FY 06 - $200K.  Additional funding of $4.3M during FY04 from the National Institute of Justice is also being pursued.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts ranging between $100K to $500K per year.  The total value of all efforts awarded under this BAA will not exceed $4.9 million.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   


VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a  SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting system known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding their use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

All questions prior to the submission of a technical and cost proposal can be addressed to the technical POC, Robert M. Husnay, telephone: (315) 330-4821 or email Robert.Husnay@rl.af.mil.  

Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Renee Arcuri, telephone (315) 330-4777 or e-mail Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is an announcement of a Request for Information (RFI).  The Government does not presently intend to award a contract but requests the following information for planning purposes.  The IMDS Systems Program Office (SPO) is doing market research to gain knowledge of the capabilities of commercial products or product suites that have the potential for fulfilling Quality Assurance (QA) automated information management functional requirements for the Air Force.<br><br> This RFI is seeking information on the availability of commercial off-the-shelf QA products that may have the capability to be rapidly fielded by the Air Force.  Background information on IMDS and Air Force QA processes is available through the Hanscom Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB) web site at <a href="http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil/esc_opps.asp?rfp=R195">http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil/esc_opps.asp?rfp=R195</a>.<br><br> The products must have a viable commercial presence in industry and should be in current use in applications similar to the Air Force use.  To determine the extent the current commercial products can be adapted to the Air Force maintenance environment, the IMDS SPO will perform an analysis of the real-world use of the actual applications and how the vendors' products support QA processes.  In conducting this analysis, the IMDS SPO may conduct on-site visits to observe selected QA functional scenarios and capabilities as they are being performed by application users.<br><br> The products must have been developed and documented in a manner such that they are able to meet Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for Command, Control, Communications and Computers Integrated Support Plan (C4ISP) to include architecture and security http://iase.disa.mil/ditscap. The following information is requested for the Government analysis:<br> *	Basic product characteristics<br> o	  Supportability - use of proprietary programming languages<br> o	  Reliability<br> *	Licenses and licensing requirements<br> *	Documentation - system support, administration, and user<br> *	Open Systems/Standards Compliance<br> *	System Architecture<br> o	Architectural documentation that will assist in:<br> 	Identification of any differences between the system architecture and the Common Operating Environment (COE). http://diicoe.disa.mil/coe<br> 	Identification of any differences between the system architecture and the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) integration framework.  http://www.gcss-af.com/cfs/outreach/index.cfm<br> *	Communication Architecture<br> o	Networking approach<br> *	Security Architecture<br> *	Data Architecture<br> o	Use of transactional data stores, operational data stores and data warehousing<br> o	Scalability<br> o	Storage of historical data<br> *	Interoperability<br> *	The proposed deployment approach and timelines<br> *	A description of business processes currently performed by the Air Force that would have to be changed or modified to use the COTS product.<br><br> Each product should have an accompanying tentative pricing structure.  Any pricing information will remain confidential   Submittals are not offers that may be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.<br><br> Contact information for two current users is required and should include name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.<br><br> Contractor formats for the requested information are acceptable.  RFI submittals may be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer identified below.  RFI submittals should be submitted no later than 1600 CST, 9 January 2003.<br><br> This is not a request for proposals.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This is a Request for Information only and does not, by its issuance, restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will not reimburse any costs for any information, documentation, and/or data submitted or preparation costs for submittals in response to this RFI.<br><br> Please note that the HERBB will be the primary source of information for the IMDS acquisition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The US Army RDECOM, CERDEC, Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate will be issuing this BAA to solicit proposals for a program to reduce the reflectivity of the uncooled far-infrared (7 - 12 um spectral band) focal plane arrays (FPAs) of 640 by 48 0 elements with a pixel size of less than 30 micrometer, and fabricate a brassboard uncooled IR camera or brassboard uncooled IR cameras with the improved/modified FPA.   This is a two-phase program. The period for Phase I is 12 months, and the period for Phase II is 12 months.  In Phase I, the contractors are to design and fabricate the FPA structures to minimize the reflection from the FPAs. The contractors will make several design and fabrication of engineering lots and make measurements to assess their effort to accomplish the  technical objectives. Deliverables include working FPAs in vacuum packages and electronics cards/accessories for imaging and display. In Phase I, the government may decide to discontinue funding particular contractors if the progress is not satisfactory. In Phase II, one or two contractors from Phase I will be selected to fabricate a brassboard uncooled IR camera or brassboard uncooled IR cameras to include the techniques developed in Phase I and other programs. These may include the improved FPAs, the ext ernal optics, and the electronic components. The size of the FPA for the brassboard camera shall be 640 x 480 elements. The first camera to be built will be mainly an effort to integrate the components. The second effort will be an effort to optimize the c amera in weight, size, and cost. The contractors are encouraged to submit two-phase proposals, but Phase II efforts may be solicited through a competitive follow-on BAA.  Technical POC:  Mr. Byong Ahn, RDECOM, CERDEC, Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate, Ft.

<DESC>This amendment is a clarification to a previous notification.  MNK-BAA-01-0001 PartI was unarchived in error.  The amendment is uploaded to MNK-BAA-02-0002 Part 1.  The following is the actual amendment to the BAA:

Introduction:

The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Flight Vehicle Integration Branch (AFRL/MNAV) is interested in receiving white papers for the High Speed Dispense (HSD) of munitions from the Common Aerodynamic Vehicle (CAV).  The white papers will be accepted under the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) number MNK-BAA-02-0002; Armament Technology Research; topic entitled VEHICLES INTEGRATION RESEARCH.  The BAA is modified for this potential procurement in that the Air Force allows offerors to submit a 10-page white paper instead of the two to three page white paper called for in MNK-BAA-02-0002.  The 10-page white paper should address the program objectives described below, and should include within the 10 pages a cost Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for each of the 4 TOs described below.  White paper submittal deadline is 4:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) 17 Dec 03.  White papers must be submitted as an email attachment to both abbottc@eglin.af.mil and donna.moran@eglin.af.mil.  A confirmation of receipt will be generated via email as acceptable white papers are received.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to ensure that confirmation of receipt is obtained by the white paper submittal deadline.  All white papers received will be reviewed and evaluated using the White Paper Evaluation Criteria found within this document.  A full proposal consisting of two volumes (technical and price/cost) may then be requested via email Request for Proposal from those offeror(s) who the Air Force believes has submitted the most advantageous white paper(s).              

Background:

This effort builds on the Fast Reaction Weapon Demonstration (FRWD) program (see Tech Report:  AFRL-MN-EG-TR-2002-7085; Fax a current, certified DD Form 2345 (Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement) to the technical program manager, Capt Vincent Dabrowski, to receive a copy of the report).  The FRWD was structured to identify and define technologies applicable to dispensing munitions from supersonic/hypersonic vehicles. The use of inventory weapons in new high-speed delivery vehicles reduces cost and mitigates risk.  FRWD performed a concept definition and selection effort using DARPA’s Advanced Rapid Response Missile and Powered Low-Cost Autonomous Attack System (PLOCAAS) payload.

This HSD technology development effort is one part of a coordinated set of technology development programs in support of the CAV (part of the FALCON program).  See solicitation #SN03-23 (http://www.fedbizopps.gov).  Additional information is available at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/#tto.  The CAV is a maneuvering, aerothermodynamic shell reentry vehicle envisioned to deliver a variety of payloads from space.  The CAV acquisition strategy involves a number of simultaneous development efforts that are reduced in number to one as the program advances.  For purposes of this announcement, active CAV designs are defined as those that are being carried forward to the next level of development.  Active CAV designs are currently held by:  Andrews Space Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp., and Northrop Grumman Corp. (http://www.darpa.mil/body/NewsItems/pdf/falcon_ph_1.pdf).  Any additional CAV award(s) would also be considered active designs.  Interested contractors without an active CAV design are encouraged to team with one of the companies with an active design.

Program Objective:

The goal of the HSD program is to identify, refine and test munitions separation/dispense technologies for the CAV, enabling conventional munitions/submunitions to be delivered at hypersonic speeds.  The munitions will be environmentally protected during the hypersonic phase, decelerated, and then dispensed at a condition suitable to the munitions.  It is envisioned that this technology will be transitioned to other hypersonic vehicles as they become available.

Technical Requirements:

The design will include a primary dispense (separation) capability from the CAV including removal, environmental attenuation, stabilization, deceleration, and secondary dispense to release submunitions.  Wind tunnel, sled, and flight tests are envisioned to fully demonstrate the HSD system. 

It is desirable that the HSD system be capable of employing many munitions (large "loadout") and be compatible with the maximum number of "smart" weapon types.  The primary munitions of interest are the Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) and the PLOCAAS.  Both munitions will be addressed in this effort, but only the SDB will be hardware tested.

The main tasks for this program are laid out below.  The program will be structured as a concept refinement task order (TO) with additional task orders for each of the remaining tasks.  It is envisioned that up to two contracts could be awarded for TO 1, and only one contract for TO's 2-4.  

TO 1 – Concept Refinement:  TO 1 shall be performed upon receipt of Government authorization to proceed/contract award.  The contractor shall perform a trade study, identify technology investments, and propose a Preliminary Design (PD) compatible with one of the active CAV designs.  The contractor is expected, but not required, to leverage the concept definition work from the FRWD program.  The contractor shall develop a Draft Master Test Plan Outline (DMTPO), which includes all ground and flight tests.  The PD and DMTPO will be presented at a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) prior to delivery to the Government for final approval.

TO 2 – Design/Wind Tunnel Test:  The contractor shall develop a detailed hardware design.  Simulation, aerostability analysis, component testing and other risk reduction activities shall be performed as required.  Subscale models will be fabricated and wind tunnel tested.  The contractor shall perform and support the wind tunnel testing in accordance with the sponsor-approved Master Test Plan.  The Final Design including system specifications and Formal Master Test Plan will be presented at a Critical Design Review (CDR).  

TO 3 – Fabrication of Hardware:  The contractor shall fabricate and integrate the unit to be ground-tested, including any special modifications necessary for sled track compatibility.  

TO 4 – Sled Track Test:  The contractor shall perform and support the sled track testing of the hardware in accordance with the sponsor-approved Master Test Plan.  The contractor shall also provide a final report.

Test Support:

The contractor shall be responsible for all test plans necessary for the maturation and demonstration of the hardware/software products to be tested.  Contractor-generated test plans, as approved by the Government, will become contractual requirements.  For tests being conducted at Government facilities, the contractor shall be responsible for providing technical support, analysis, data and test planning support to the identified responsible Government test organization.  The contractor shall provide test support to include the following: support of test planning meetings; test setup and checkout; test article build up and checkout; installation of hardware; instrumentation package support; required documentation for testing; identification of risk and suggestions for improvements; record test setup; data collection for evaluation of results; post-test analysis and test result documentation.

Data Requirements:  It is expected that the following data submittals will be required:  
Study [DI-GDRQ-80567A, Subsystem Design Analysis Report (Study Report)], Status reports [DI-MGMT-80368/T, Status Report], cost/schedule management [DI-MGMT-81334/T, Contract Work Breakdown Structure (Cost/Schedule Breakdown Structure)]; [DI-FNCL-80912, Performance and Cost Report], program review info [DI-ADMN-81250A, Conference Minutes]; [DI-ADMN-81373/T], hardware design/drawings [DI-SESS-81002B, Developmental Design Drawings and Associated Lists], test plans [DI-NDTI-80566, Test Plan], test data [DI-NDTI-80809B, Test/Inspection Report], system specs [DI-IPSC-81432A, System/Subsystem Design Description], and final tech report [DI-MISC-80711A/T, Scientific and Technical Reports, Final Report].
	
Meetings and Reviews:  The Government anticipates the following program meetings and reviews:  Kickoff within four weeks of contract start date at offeror's facilities; Technical Interchange Meetings at times coinciding with key program milestones or decision points that alternate between the offeror's facilities and Eglin AFB; and a Final Program review at completion of the program at Eglin AFB, FL.  The contractor may propose to conduct or participate in other meetings with subcontractors, Government agencies, or third parties, as deemed necessary.  

Proprietary Items: The Government highly recommends the proposed design include no parts, materials, or software that are proprietary.  The offeror is responsible for explicitly identifying any proprietary materials, products, software, or processes to be used by the prime contractor or subcontractors in the performance of this program and to address acquisition of data rights or licenses, or expected recoupment of development costs for those proprietary items that will be integral to the hardware and software design and fabricated test items. 


Additional Information:

(1) Anticipated Period of Performance:  TO 1 is expected to last up to 6 months with results deliverable at the end of month 3 to coincide with the FALCON Program's Phase II award.  The award of additional task orders on the HSD program will likely occur after this FALCON award.

(2) Type of Contract: The Government anticipates awarding up to two Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts to the offerors who the Air Force believes has submitted the most advantageous white papers, based upon evaluation using the White Paper Evaluation Criteria found within this document.

(3) Government Estimate/Funding:  The Government has currently allotted a total of approximately $1.5M of FY04 funds for this program.  The Government expects TO 1 costs would not exceed $200k, and TO 2 costs would not exceed $1.1M.  Tasks 3 and 4 are currently unfunded.  However, if further funds become available, Tasks 3 and 4 could also be awarded.  This funding profile is an estimate only and is not a promise of funding, as all funding is subject to changes/availability and Government discretion.  It is desired that contract expenditures be managed and billed so as to maximize FY04 expenditures.  

(4) Government-Furnished Property/Equipment/Information (GFX):  The contractor is responsible for explicitly identifying required GFX, contacting the appropriate Government Agency for its utilization, and including any associated costs within the proposal.  

(5) White Paper Evaluation Criteria:  MNK-BAA-02-0002, Part II PROPOSAL EVALUATION, is amended to reflect the following evaluation factors, listed in descending order of importance:  

1.	Overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, potential contributions of the effort to the AFRL/MN mission, and extent to which the research effort will contribute to balancing the overall research program of this directorate.  This includes the following four sub-factors (listed in descending order of importance):
a.  Applicability of proposed approach to an active CAV design; 
b.  Scope and feasibility (to include risk assessment) of proposed HSD concept of operation and hardware design;
c.  Scope of the proposed approach in addressing critical issues through the appropriate mix of analysis, simulation, critical component fabrication, as well as component, wind tunnel, and sled track testing;
d.  Soundness of process to develop a system design, test plans, system specs, and the final technical report.

2.

<DESC>D--Request for Information (RFI) 
for an Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) DoD-wide Enterprise License 


SUBJECT

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) for an Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) enterprise-wide capability designed to resolve the vulnerability management issues and configuration management concerns across the Department of Defense (DoD). This capability should address the following vulnerability processes: (1) assessment, (2) compliance, (3) reporting, and (4) remediation.  Responses are due to this RFI by 16:00 hrs Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 1 December 2003.  

DESCRIPTION

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), at the request of the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and in support of National Security goals established by the President, is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of an Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) enterprise-wide capability across the Department of Defense (DoD).  This capability should fully integrate Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) vulnerability identification, verification, reporting, and remediation, while providing a cost effective training method to employ the technology.  Emphasis should include the capability to employ these tools in all operating environments, such as specified in the Defense Information Infrastructure / Common Operating Environment (DII COE).

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

·Description of a conceptual architecture to include logistical tail requirements such as training, maintenance, installation, technical support
·Technical feasibility assessments
·Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for core architecture and possible alternatives
·Schedule estimates (capability ready for deployment)
·Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, deploying and managing this IAVM solution

ACQUISITION STRATEGY


While the government is soliciting information from all of industry, the government intends to satisfy this requirement by placing a task order under an existing multiple award ID/IQ contract.  The existing contract the Government intends to use is the Information Assurance (IASSURE) contracts.  Information on this contract, including contract terms and conditions, ordering procedures and prime contractors can be found at http://www.disa.mil/acq/contracts/iachar.html. 
The IASSURE contract has 11 prime contractors and has the flexibility of prime contractors being able to add subcontractors to their team at any time.  Companies interested in becoming a subcontractor under the IASSURE contract should contact one of the 11 prime contractors directly.  Point of contact for the companies can also be found on the above IASSURE website.



REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the basic minimum functional requirements for this IAVM capability.  
(1) Automated Vulnerability Identification and Reporting
System Administrators (SA’s) must have tools that automate the tasks of asset identification, IAVA identification, and IAVA reporting.  These tools must also provide the SA with step-by-step instructions appropriate for the platform to facilitate ease of installation and configuration operations.  In addition, adequate help facilities (help pages) should be imbedded within the product to provide vulnerability information concerning the tasks above and possible remediation techniques. Tool should have a remote management capability. Having the above capabilities would greatly reduce the burden placed upon SA’s.

Tools for asset identification, IAVA identification, and IAVA reporting should also be able to run on “Microsoft, major Unix based, Linux, and Cisco operating systems and should be able to scan Nortel, Foundry, Enterasys, Cabletron, and Marconi network infrastructure devices”.  New vulnerabilities surface on a regular basis and these tools must keep abreast of these changes.  New vulnerability alerts must be continually updated to be able to validate the solutions and links required for remediation of all vulnerabilities.  All DoD IAVAs are currently stored in a vulnerability database, and new ones are added as they are released.  Storage of all information in an SQL-addressable database should be supported and allow direct custom queries, or export / linking capability to other databases.  Reports should be available on any machine with a DoD approved web browser. These tools should include differential reporting capabilities based on host or vulnerability with customizable scans for IAVA compliance and service configurable scans. Tool should also have a hierarchical reporting capability.

Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts (IAVAs) are only available to .mil sites and not the commercial marketplace.  

The IAVM tools must be able to be configured to check for updates over the network every time they are run. In addition to adding vulnerability checks, the tools should validate the solutions and links provided in the screens and reports of the product with each update, minimizing the possibility that the user may encounter a broken link. These tools should also include the ability to identify vulnerabilities
associated with Routers, Switches and network printers.
Differential reporting capabilities based on Host or Vulnerability
should be included.
(2) Vulnerability Remediation
A key consideration in this IAVM capability is that your proposed suite of vulnerability assessment, compliance and tracking tools must be interoperable with multiple remediation tools. These remediation tools should support the largest number of possible operating systems and applications that DoD uses. Based on the product you propose please identify the remediation tools in which your product is interoperable.
(3) Field Proven Tools
Scanning for vulnerabilities must quickly determine IAVA compliance on a network. Coupled with a central reporting capability, an enterprise solution should provide an effective means to enforce IAVA compliance.  Any selected vulnerability discovery tool at the SA level should be able to be utilized “under” the security routers in an organization's top-level architecture as well as within smaller enclaves that may be protected by firewalls and other security devices that are part of the DoD defense-in-depth posture.  Enterprise tools must work in deployable, tactical, and isolated units in remote theaters, with a small (e.g., 256 KBps) satellite link with up to 600ms delay.
(4) Non-Disruptive to Normal Operations
These IAVM tools must be able to be run on live networks during normal operating hours without affecting the user's mission.  These tools must be able to be used during normal operating hours so there is no need to scan at night while users are away and there is a worry about machines being turned off during off-duty hours. Basically these tools should not be disruptive to the operating environment.
(5) Accountability and Enforcement
Requirement for this part of the IAVM capability should be that whenever a System Administrator performs a network IAVA scan, a status report should be sent to one or more enterprise IAVM data repositories. 

Examples of information that should be presented in the status report are as follows: (First and foremost is the IAVA compliance data on network assets within the System Administrator’s purview)

·The time and date the scan was performed should be available
·The version of the products used to perform the scan should be available

The complete data set must also allow a Security Manager to monitor IAVA compliance by showing:

·If the System Administrator scanned his network
·When they scanned the network
·If the System Administrator scanned using the most up-to-date tool, and hence scanned for the most recent IAVAs
·What IAVAs are still outstanding?
·What IAVAs have been applied?
(6) Training/Technical Support for IAVM Implementation
Past experience within DoD deploying IA tools has proven that without training, a large percentage of tools remain “on the shelf” and do not get used, resulting in a poor return on investment.  In addition, most IAVM mechanisms are powerful tools that, if not properly employed, have the potential to harm a network with a single click.

To provide tool and IAVA specific training on particularly complex IAVA “fixes,” a capability must be provided for virtual, interactive, on-demand IA training to SAs from their duty location/organization computers.  Students should be able to log into a “virtual interactive classroom” using a number of teaching tools (e.g., streaming video/audio, online classroom chat, web boards, and virtual servers).  Students should also be able to log into a virtual classroom from anywhere in the world. It is imperative that students should learn to run IAVM tools and do compliance reporting on a virtual network before ever touching their real network. 

This capability should compliment training presented at formal DoD IA training schools by training specific technical IAVA requirements.  Whenever changes occur in the tools the training should be updated, reducing the lag time that now occurs in updating/improving individual technical skills. 

This capability should be available to the Government in the following:

·Availability of an enterprise license 
·Availability of enterprise maintenance
·24 X 7 X 365 day technical support: Because this tool will be fielded world-wide please submit information on how you would provide technical support for both CONUS and OCONUS theaters and in multiple environments (i.e., Garrison environment, tactical environment, ships, aircrafts…etc)
(7) Enterprising View of Vulnerabilities
The Security Manager in an organization should be provided with an enterprise view of the DoD security posture.  Query capabilities, such as “Show me the status of an “X IAVA on “X platform”, should be provided within an enterprise view by the IAVM capability.

The intent of the DoD network architecture should allow multiple IAVM tools to be deployed throughout the enterprise, while maintaining a central repository for vulnerability information. Communications to the central repository should be encrypted.  In addition, all interactions with the enterprise database through the standard user interface should be encrypted.

(8) National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Certification Process

This capability must have completed or initiated the NIAP Certification process (GOAL: Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 4 certification)

SUMMARY
The goal of this RFI is to seek information that will assist in the development and deployment of an IAVM enterprise-wide capability.  This effort’s intent is to give DoD a tool suite to proactively, efficiently, and effectively manage their IAVM Program, which will reduce the workload on both system administrators (SA) and network managers (NM) alike.

<DESC>D--Request for Information (RFI) 
for an Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) DoD-wide Enterprise License 


SUBJECT

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) for an Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) enterprise-wide capability designed to resolve the vulnerability management issues and configuration management concerns across the Department of Defense (DoD). This capability should address the following vulnerability processes: (1) assessment, (2) compliance, (3) reporting, and (4) remediation.  Responses are due to this RFI by 16:00 hrs Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 5 December 2003.  

DESCRIPTION

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), at the request of the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and in support of National Security goals established by the President, is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of an Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) enterprise-wide capability across the Department of Defense (DoD).  This capability should fully integrate Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) vulnerability identification, verification, reporting, and remediation, while providing a cost effective training method to employ the technology.  Emphasis should include the capability to employ these tools in all operating environments, such as specified in the Defense Information Infrastructure / Common Operating Environment (DII COE).

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

·Description of a conceptual architecture to include logistical tail requirements such as training, maintenance, installation, technical support
·Technical feasibility assessments
·Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for core architecture and possible alternatives
·Schedule estimates (capability ready for deployment)
·Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, deploying and managing this IAVM solution

ACQUISITION STRATEGY


While the government is soliciting information from all of industry, the government intends to satisfy this requirement by placing a task order under an existing multiple award ID/IQ contract.  The existing contract the Government intends to use is the Information Assurance (IASSURE) contracts.  Information on this contract, including contract terms and conditions, ordering procedures and prime contractors can be found at http://www.disa.mil/acq/contracts/iachar.html. 
The IASSURE contract has 11 prime contractors and has the flexibility of prime contractors being able to add subcontractors to their team at any time.  Companies interested in becoming a subcontractor under the IASSURE contract should contact one of the 11 prime contractors directly.  Point of contact for the companies can also be found on the above IASSURE website.



REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the basic minimum functional requirements for this IAVM capability.  
(1) Automated Vulnerability Identification and Reporting
System Administrators (SA’s) must have tools that automate the tasks of asset identification, IAVA identification, and IAVA reporting.  These tools must also provide the SA with step-by-step instructions appropriate for the platform to facilitate ease of installation and configuration operations.  In addition, adequate help facilities (help pages) should be imbedded within the product to provide vulnerability information concerning the tasks above and possible remediation techniques. Tool should have a remote management capability. Having the above capabilities would greatly reduce the burden placed upon SA’s.

Tools for asset identification, IAVA identification, and IAVA reporting should also be able to run on “Microsoft, major Unix based, Linux, and Cisco operating systems and should be able to scan Nortel, Foundry, Enterasys, Cabletron, and Marconi network infrastructure devices”.  New vulnerabilities surface on a regular basis and these tools must keep abreast of these changes.  New vulnerability alerts must be continually updated to be able to validate the solutions and links required for remediation of all vulnerabilities.  All DoD IAVAs are currently stored in a vulnerability database, and new ones are added as they are released.  Storage of all information in an SQL-addressable database should be supported and allow direct custom queries, or export / linking capability to other databases.  Reports should be available on any machine with a DoD approved web browser. These tools should include differential reporting capabilities based on host or vulnerability with customizable scans for IAVA compliance and service configurable scans. Tool should also have a hierarchical reporting capability.

Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts (IAVAs) are only available to .mil sites and not the commercial marketplace.  

The IAVM tools must be able to be configured to check for updates over the network every time they are run. In addition to adding vulnerability checks, the tools should validate the solutions and links provided in the screens and reports of the product with each update, minimizing the possibility that the user may encounter a broken link. These tools should also include the ability to identify vulnerabilities
associated with Routers, Switches and network printers.
Differential reporting capabilities based on Host or Vulnerability
should be included.
(2) Vulnerability Remediation
A key consideration in this IAVM capability is that your proposed suite of vulnerability assessment, compliance and tracking tools must be interoperable with multiple remediation tools. These remediation tools should support the largest number of possible operating systems and applications that DoD uses. Based on the product you propose please identify the remediation tools in which your product is interoperable.
(3) Field Proven Tools
Scanning for vulnerabilities must quickly determine IAVA compliance on a network. Coupled with a central reporting capability, an enterprise solution should provide an effective means to enforce IAVA compliance.  Any selected vulnerability discovery tool at the SA level should be able to be utilized “under” the security routers in an organization's top-level architecture as well as within smaller enclaves that may be protected by firewalls and other security devices that are part of the DoD defense-in-depth posture.  Enterprise tools must work in deployable, tactical, and isolated units in remote theaters, with a small (e.g., 256 KBps) satellite link with up to 600ms delay.
(4) Non-Disruptive to Normal Operations
These IAVM tools must be able to be run on live networks during normal operating hours without affecting the user's mission.  These tools must be able to be used during normal operating hours so there is no need to scan at night while users are away and there is a worry about machines being turned off during off-duty hours. Basically these tools should not be disruptive to the operating environment.
(5) Accountability and Enforcement
Requirement for this part of the IAVM capability should be that whenever a System Administrator performs a network IAVA scan, a status report should be sent to one or more enterprise IAVM data repositories. 

Examples of information that should be presented in the status report are as follows: (First and foremost is the IAVA compliance data on network assets within the System Administrator’s purview)

·The time and date the scan was performed should be available
·The version of the products used to perform the scan should be available

The complete data set must also allow a Security Manager to monitor IAVA compliance by showing:

·If the System Administrator scanned his network
·When they scanned the network
·If the System Administrator scanned using the most up-to-date tool, and hence scanned for the most recent IAVAs
·What IAVAs are still outstanding?
·What IAVAs have been applied?
(6) Training/Technical Support for IAVM Implementation
Past experience within DoD deploying IA tools has proven that without training, a large percentage of tools remain “on the shelf” and do not get used, resulting in a poor return on investment.  In addition, most IAVM mechanisms are powerful tools that, if not properly employed, have the potential to harm a network with a single click.

To provide tool and IAVA specific training on particularly complex IAVA “fixes,” a capability must be provided for virtual, interactive, on-demand IA training to SAs from their duty location/organization computers.  Students should be able to log into a “virtual interactive classroom” using a number of teaching tools (e.g., streaming video/audio, online classroom chat, web boards, and virtual servers).  Students should also be able to log into a virtual classroom from anywhere in the world. It is imperative that students should learn to run IAVM tools and do compliance reporting on a virtual network before ever touching their real network. 

This capability should compliment training presented at formal DoD IA training schools by training specific technical IAVA requirements.  Whenever changes occur in the tools the training should be updated, reducing the lag time that now occurs in updating/improving individual technical skills. 

This capability should be available to the Government in the following:

·Availability of an enterprise license 
·Availability of enterprise maintenance
·24 X 7 X 365 day technical support: Because this tool will be fielded world-wide please submit information on how you would provide technical support for both CONUS and OCONUS theaters and in multiple environments (i.e., Garrison environment, tactical environment, ships, aircrafts…etc)
(7) Enterprising View of Vulnerabilities
The Security Manager in an organization should be provided with an enterprise view of the DoD security posture.  Query capabilities, such as “Show me the status of an “X IAVA on “X platform”, should be provided within an enterprise view by the IAVM capability.

The intent of the DoD network architecture should allow multiple IAVM tools to be deployed throughout the enterprise, while maintaining a central repository for vulnerability information. Communications to the central repository should be encrypted.  In addition, all interactions with the enterprise database through the standard user interface should be encrypted.

(8) National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Certification Process

This capability must have completed or initiated the NIAP Certification process (GOAL: Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 4 certification)

SUMMARY
The goal of this RFI is to seek information that will assist in the development and deployment of an IAVM enterprise-wide capability.  This effort’s intent is to give DoD a tool suite to proactively, efficiently, and effectively manage their IAVM Program, which will reduce the workload on both system administrators (SA) and network managers (NM) alike.

<DESC>This amendment changes the submission date to COB 30 September 2003.   58 -The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is interested in receiving information from sources that feel they may be capable of providing off the shelf or near off the shelf capabilities that will support the MANPACK Technologies for the 21st Century, Advanced Concepts Technology Demonstration (ACTD) effort.  The information sought through this announcement will support USSOCOM and Marine Corps efforts to develop and package a toolbox of advanced capabilities, including an open, plug and play architecture that is user-configurable, small in size, lightweight and low power.   Today, most systems are developed independently and do not use open, plug and play architectures.  As a result, a total redesign is required when system upgrades are necessary.  Air, maritime, and larger land based systems have had advanced threat warning capabilities for many years but these systems are too large for use by individual soldiers. Technology is available today that will allow development and packaging of advanced threat warning capabilities using an open, plug and play architecture, which is user-configurable, small in size, lightweight, and require relatively little power. MANPACK capabilities must operate in diverse environments and deal with a multitude of potential threat information quickly and easily without burdening the operator.  These capabilities, since transmitting RF is not always practical, must also meet stringent size, weight and power requirements.  

Some of the toolbox technologies sought: 
Advanced signal detection; 
Sound detection and direction;
Sound canceling;
Biological/Chemical detectors; 
Body worn computers; 
Information display technologies including hand-held, wrist and head mounted displays;
Technologies for receipt, processing, control, and display of information from other platforms such as UAVs; 
Scaleable hardware (HW) bus structures (e.g. PCMCIA) that could be used in portable applications;
Language translation and exploitation;
Detection of enemy personnel, tanks, etc. via thermal, radar, etc.
Small belt worn quick scan energy detector (2MHz-10GHz objective);
Embedded National Tactical Receiver (ENTR) incorporated into the Manpack for demonstration of National Threat Warning capability;
Programmable electronic attack and/or jamming of specific targets;
Battlefield mapping and/or awareness.
Data input and output devices (preference to permit mostly hands free operation). 

Expertise and Advice Sought:
SIGINT HW & SW architecture;
National/Tactical Integration

Preference will be given to:
Small businesses;
Technologies that provide a mobile soldier threat warning to dangers in soldiers area;
Mature technologies:
ready for purchase within 12 months or 
requiring minimal assistance to be ready in 12 months.
Technologies on commercial formats, (e.g. PC104, C-PCI, PCMCIA, etc) or can be easily integrated into a manpack system.

This announcement is NOT a Request for Purchase.  This is a Sources Sought and does not commit the Government to award a contract under the above listed terms, nor is the Government responsible to pay for samples or information received.  Innovative and/or revolutionary technical solutions are welcome.  Industry responses to this notice must contain the following information: (1) name and address, to include fax, email of firm and POC; (2) technical capabilities description.  Questions from industry should be directed to the attention Marc A. Duval at duvalm@socom.mil or by phone at (813)281-0560 ext 304. Responses (eg white papers, limited to 30 pages) should be sent electronically to the United States Special Operations Command, ATTN: Manpack_ACTD@socom.mil (10MB limit).  Please cc Mr. Marc Duval via email on all related documents submitted (eg. White papers) at duvalm@socom.mil.  A cutoff date of COB 30 September, 2003 is established for the submission of responses.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General, has a requirement to integrate, implement, and further develop a Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) solution acquired from the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General that closely parallels the investigative business process of the Labor OIG.  The custom development of the GOTS application developed in Cold Fusion, and powered with a Verity document search engine, will significantly improve current OIG workflow and document management practices of information contained in our management systems, and improve upon the accessibility of information contained within.  The OIG seeks a multi task approach, innovative solution to fulfill this requirement.
 
Specifically, the Office of Labor Racketeering and Fraud Investigations (OLRFI), Office of Inspections and Special Investigations (OISI), and Office of Legal Services (OLS) have begun to document the core workflow processes followed during the development of OIG investigations, inspections, and hotline complaint processing.  Management system applications for these OIG offices record indexed criminal, civil, administrative, confidential, inspection, and other information, used for program office mission related purposes and mandatory semiannual report submission to the U.S. Congress.  Various data forms in electronic and hard copy format are currently employed to support the development cycle for these entities.  A Functional Design Document (FDD) was prepared in 2002 to illustrate the investigative business workflow.  This FDD will be used as a starting point to further define current investigative workflow practices and to improve upon the existing document search and retrieval disparate technologies that support these component activities and to integrate content search retrieval and storage of application data in the OIG Management System driven by the GOTS application. 

Management system reports are derived from data maintained in these systems and are produced through the use of fixed report output listings in portable data format (PDF) and hypertext markup language (HTML) format. These reports are used for internal management purposes and mandated published reports to the U.S. Congress.

The OIG requires a nationwide enterprise-wide information technology service to assist in meeting its responsibilities mandated under Federal legislation and Executive Orders.  The information technology, telecommunications, and management system applications infrastructure must be proven to be reliable, stable, easy to use and secure for all OIG employees so that they can respond to the needs of the Department of Labor and its stakeholders.  Additionally, given the ever changing world of information technology and telecommunications in the marketplace, the solution proposed shall be able to adapt to and meet expected increased demands for security, system storage, and retrieval capacity, functional use, and timely transactional throughput provided to the investigative and inspection components of the OIG.

The capability to improve upon collection, storage and retrieval of electronic information contained in its current management systems will enable the OIG to realize greater success in the paperless, digital workplace of the federal government. 

Existing electronic storage of investigations and inspections are maintained in a fourth generation Oracle 9.2 relational database management system and externally in Windows 2000 file servers, which contain documents and spreadsheets. Both application systems are populated and controlled through daily updates using Oracle Forms 9i, running under Oracle Internet Application Server version 9.02.  Sophisticated static web-based management reports are produced using web enabled Micro Focus Net Express and Server Express COBOL software.  Other similar cyclical COBOL reports run as character-based executions and that print on designated UNIX printers.  

The database, file and web servers run under Sun Microsystems UNIX operating system Solaris version 2.8.  Forms input and retrieval processing is accessible through a secure OIG intranet environment using the standard agency Microsoft (MS) Internet Explorer version 5.5 web browser.  Ad-hoc end user queries and reporting are produced through the use of MS Windows client workstations running Oracle Discoverer version 4.1.47. 

The OIG WAN/LAN topography (see Figure 1) enables communication to the central database server and web services for all Management Systems applications. These services extend to six remote regional and approximately twenty-four sub offices throughout the continental Unites States through high-speed communication telephone lines. The bandwidth ranges from 128 kbps for the smaller sub offices to 512 kbps for the regional offices with upgrades scheduled for completion during FY2004.

Potential vendors will develop a solution to refine requirements for the integration and future development of the aforementioned GOTS software product.  The resulting management system is an e-Government initiative.

It is mandatory that all proposed staff have a security clearance.  A current top secret, secret or equivalent security clearance is necessary to access the data to complete this project.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  NAVAIR Lakehurst is seeking potential sources, industry comments, and product information for the acquisition of the development and deployment of a  Re-systemized Metrology and Calibration (METCAL) Information System (RMIS) for the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Metrology Automated System for Uniform Recall and Reporting (MEASURE) Program Office (MPO).     Navy and Marine Corps METCAL Information Systems (METCAL IS).  

The METCAL IS supports the business processes for the Department of the Navy (DoN) metrology and calibration services enterprise.  The user organizations that comprise the enterprise are NAVAIR, Marine Corps System Command (MARCOR), Naval Space and Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), and the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) including Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC) and Strategic Systems Programs (SSP).  The calibration business processes of these organizations are relatively common; the differences are driven by mission requirements.  

RMIS will replace legacy Navy and Marine Corps METCAL Information Systems (METCAL IS). It will fix the performance problems of the legacy systems, be web enabled, and support the enterprise more completely by including additional capabilities in the business areas of finance, management, and production job control.  The data gathered by the RMIS will be used for DoN program budgets, calibration facility workload planning and analyses, configuration change documentation, reliability analyses, interval analysis, engineering studies, and the ability to trace measurements from the end user to standards maintained by the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST).

RMIS will recall, track, and report status of all Navy and Marine Corps metrology assets throughout their life cycle.  It will capture the history of calibration and repair events on each asset as it completes its calibration cycles.  This data will be used for asset life cycle metrology engineering.  RMIS will report work in process, status, inventory, history, readiness, business, and financial information for laboratory and asset managers at all command echelons within the DoN.  

RMIS will provide calibration laboratory / facility managers the capability to manage their business activities such as production planning, scheduling, and control; resource loading and workforce skills management functions.  There are interface requirements to time, attendance, and payroll (civilian and military) applications.

The scope of operations is worldwide, current legacy Automated Information Systems (AIS) applications provide services for Navy and Marine Corps laboratories in the continental United States, shore facilities overseas, and deployed fleet units.  DoN sponsors approximately 500 calibration laboratories ashore and afloat ranging from one technician on afloat units to well over 100 technicians at larger depot level maintenance facilities.

The central objective of the system is to provide an enterprise capability for all DoN calibration facilities to carry out the business of calibrating and centrally managing Test and Monitoring Systems (TAMS), Test, Monitoring and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) and calibration standards using a single information knowledge management system.  The goal is to provide a single integrated METCAL AIS that is common to all Navy organizations performing calibration and /or calibration management.  

1.	There are key attributes that describe a successful system.  
·	Support budget development through visibility of high quality inventory information
·	Analyze system information using an interactive data base 
·	Support traceable measurements by including Technical capability of calibration sites in the data base  
·	Standardize system data using standard reference documents within the system
·	Document utilization of calibration standards 
·	Provide secure access to controlled calibration information
·	Provide computer based user training with help desk support
·	Support the procurement of parts and related logistics products
·	Provide reverse traceability of standards used
·	Provide ability to report Out of Tolerance values
·	Include downloadable and interactive forms

The system will support the functional requirements identified.  The capability to activate or modify some or all of the functions provided will be dependant upon business rules.  

2.	The major motivators for a re-systemized Metrology and Calibration AIS are summarized below.

·	Automate manual operations
·	Provide a common intuitive tailorable interface for all Navy users, minimizing support and training requirements
·	Provide minimal data entry screens to traverse in order to complete a calibration
·	Provide mobile users (e.g. deployed units and on-site calibrators) the capability to record information in a local data base and then process these updates to a central database
·	Provide real time access to Navy METCAL data 
·	Maintain single data entry points to eliminate or minimize redundancy 
·	Share knowledge to improve processes, save costs and find best practices
·	Collect and organize information pools to add value to the process 
·	Reduce the opportunity for transcription errors to insignificant levels
·	Provide a flexible search capability 
·	Provide a powerful ad-hoc reporting capability
·	Be web enabled
·	Provide a paperless process to the extent practical 

3.	There are operational constraints on the system, some of these are listed below.
·	Limited access to wide area networks for deployed units
·	Comply with ANSI Z540-1-1994 or ISO 17025-1999
·	Interface to legacy maintenance and supply systems
·	Support automated calibration procedures
·	Support standalone operation
·	Collect asset history and selected data elements for analysis

The Navy Enterprise Application Development Guide defines the interface requirements for operating on the Web-enabled Navy network.  The Guide captures key information for Navy service providers (i.e., developers, integrators, and implementers) of operational and business processes for integrating service applications into the Enterprise portal infrastructure.  

The latest version of the Navy Enterprise Application Development Guide can be downloaded from URL https://tfw-opensource.spawar.navy.mil or https://tfw.navy.mil.

RMIS is envisioned to be an integrated system composed of two major subsystems or components interconnected by the Web.  One subsystem is the bench top or portable calibration and lab management application located at each calibration activity in a worldwide network.  These are the primary data sources of calibration activity.  The other subsystem is the master relational database that collects, processes, and synchronizes data on all calibrate able assets and calibration business activities.  All users will be able to access the master database via a web browser for data, reports, status, or analysis as and when needed.  The solution will adapt commercial or government off-the-shelf applications; use standard interfaces and an open architecture; and it will be web enabled.

1.	The RMIS shall be an integrated system that will provide:
·	Open modular architecture using standard interfaces and protocols.
·	Secure operating environment. 
·	Compliance with DoN Information Technology (IT) policies and initiatives, such as Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), Task Force Web and the Web-enabled Navy.
·	Support to the Navy-wide set of calibration business rules.  
·	Data access to all users according to their needs.  
·	Improved data quality.
·	Single point bench-top or portable-unit data entry with simplified user interface.
·	The necessary and specific calibration data available at the technician's fingertips.
·	Near real-time performance and system-wide data synchronization. 
·	Laboratory management functions. 
·	The capability of capturing all calibration data whether manually or automatically generated.
·	The capability to develop inventory packages for units leaving geographic area.
·	Control of data and functionality at the units while deployed.  
·	Interface with SAP Global Templates. 

2.    The field application will support the common functions/processes and business rules in the following areas:
·	Inventory control
·	Calibration services
·	Production management
·	Data analysis and support
·	Repair services
·	Program management support
·	System administration

The field application will be configurable for the various classes of facilities.  The depot class facilities are relatively large, have a high production rate, and will use all of the application's capabilities.  On the other end of the spectrum, non-aviation class ships have a very low production rate provided by one technician having collateral calibration duties. Ships and deployable units will be able to operate in standalone mode when they are outside of web coverage.  This requires each facility to maintain its own local inventory database for assets under their cognizant.  When a deployed unit can re-establish web connectivity, the local and central databases will update each other to synchronize the system.  Normal updates would occur daily for most facilities under control of the central facility.

The MPO is interested in COTS technology that can provide the capabilities required by these major subsystems independently or in combination, or is able to support alternative architectures that better address the technical requirements of the RMIS.  

The MEASURE Program Office and the METCAL AIS Standing Committee may hold an industry day to discuss this RFI with interested potential respondents.  Details will be made available at a later date to the respondents of this RFI, if an industry day is held.  

It is requested that 4 copies of that information be submitted via U.S. Mail or Overnight/Express mail service, NO LATER THAN 6 January 2004 to Ms. Joyce Discenza, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25222B562-1, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ  08733-5104.  Electronic or Facsimile copies will NOT be accepted.  Mrs. Discenza can be reached at (732) 323-2148 or Email:  joyce.discenza@navy.mil.

<DESC>58 - The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is interested in receiving information from sources that feel they may be capable of providing off the shelf or near off the shelf capabilities that will support the MANPACK Technologies for the 21st Century, Advanced Concepts Technology Demonstration (ACTD) effort.  The information sought through this announcement will support USSOCOM and Marine Corps efforts to develop and package a toolbox of advanced capabilities, including an open, plug and play architecture that is user-configurable, small in size, lightweight and low power.   Today, most systems are developed independently and do not use open, plug and play architectures.  As a result, a total redesign is required when system upgrades are necessary.  Air, maritime, and larger land–based systems have had advanced threat warning capabilities for many years but these systems are too large for use by individual soldiers. Technology is available today that will allow development and packaging of advanced threat warning capabilities using an open, plug and play architecture, which is user-configurable, small in size, lightweight, and require relatively little power. MANPACK capabilities must operate in diverse environments and deal with a multitude of potential threat information quickly and easily without burdening the operator.  These capabilities, since transmitting RF is not always practical, must also meet stringent size, weight and power requirements.  

Some of the “toolbox” technologies sought: 
Advanced signal detection; 
Sound detection and direction;
Sound canceling;
Biological/Chemical detectors; 
Body worn computers; 
Information display technologies including hand-held, wrist and head mounted displays;
Technologies for receipt, processing, control, and display of information from other platforms such as UAVs; 
Scaleable hardware (HW) bus structures (e.g. PCMCIA) that could be used in portable applications;
Language translation and exploitation;
Detection of enemy personnel, tanks, etc. via thermal, radar, etc.
Small belt worn quick scan energy detector (2MHz-10GHz objective);
Embedded National Tactical Receiver (ENTR) incorporated into the Manpack for demonstration of National Threat Warning capability;
Programmable electronic attack and/or jamming of specific targets;
Battlefield mapping and/or awareness.
Data input and output devices (preference to permit mostly hands free operation). 

Expertise and Advice Sought:
SIGINT HW & SW architecture;
National/Tactical Integration

Preference will be given to:
Small businesses;
Technologies that provide a mobile soldier threat warning to dangers in soldiers area;
Mature technologies:
ready for purchase within 12 months or 
requiring minimal assistance to be ready in 12 months.
Technologies on commercial formats, (e.g. PC104, C-PCI, PCMCIA, etc) or can be easily integrated into a manpack system.

This announcement is NOT a Request for Purchase.  This is a Sources Sought and does not commit the Government to award a contract under the above listed terms, nor is the Government responsible to pay for samples or information received.  Innovative and/or revolutionary technical solutions are welcome.  Industry responses to this notice must contain the following information: (1) name and address, to include fax, email of firm and POC; (2) technical capabilities description.  Questions from industry should be directed to the attention Marc A. Duval at duvalm@socom.mil or by phone at (813)281-0560 ext 304. Responses (eg white papers, limited to 30 pages) should be sent electronically to the United States Special Operations Command, ATTN: Manpack_ACTD@socom.mil (10MB limit).  Please cc Mr. Marc Duval via email on all related documents submitted (eg. White papers) at duvalm@socom.mil.  A cutoff date of COB 1 September, 2003 is established for the submission of responses.

<SUBJECT>Broad Agency Announcement for Pressure Transducers - replacing a previous BAA issued 24 Nov 03
<DESC>This announcement replaces a previous one issued on 24 Nov 03.  The previous announcement did not include anticipated quantity requirements. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport (NUWC Division Keyport) is soliciting proposals under a broad agency announcement (BAA), N00253-BAA11-03. NUWC Division Keyport is interested in proposals that provide pressure transducers for use in the production of newly-designed back-up air data sensors for the F/A-18. Proposals may be accepted, and awards made resulting from this announcement, through 30 Nov 04, addressed to Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport, Acquisition Division, 610 Dowell Street, Keyport WA 98345, Attn: Ms. Monique Klose. This is an unrestricted solicitation. The purpose of this announcement is to investigate innovative commercial technologies and approaches for pressure transducers that produce tra nsducers that meet the following characteristics: General: This specification is for a strain gauge type pressure transducer. The pressure transducer will be exposed to a pressure range of 0 to 35 PSIA and a temperature range of 40 degrees C to 95 degrees C. During operation over this temperature and pressure range the transducer will be exposed to shock levels of 750g (1 ms half sine pulse) and vibration levels of 15g from 5 Hz to 2500 Hz. Operating Pressure range: 0 to 20 PSIA. Dimensions: 1 inch diameter max by 1.25 inches long max exclusive of pressure fitting and cable strain relief. Pressure fitting: MS33656-4. Electrical connection: 3 foot polyurethane cable. Weight: 5 oz max excluding cable. Output Voltage: 100mV nominal with 10V bridge stimulus. Input current: 2.5 ma nominal at 10V bridge stimulus. Output impedance: 1500 ohms min. Accuracy: The accuracy of the pressure  transducer at room ambient conditions (20 degrees C) is to be greater than 0.1 percent Full Scale. Further, given any combination of increasing or decreasing pressure and temperature over the range of 0 to 20 PSIA and -40 to 95 degrees C, the pressure transducers output must fall within .15 percent of a central value for any repeated combination of pressure and temperature variance. The central value must be within 2 percent (FS) of the ideal value for the pressure applied regardless of the temperature. The maximum deviation in the central value found must be within 0.05 percent between any two adjacent temperature points that are 1.5 degrees C apart. The maximum slew rate in a forced air environment for temperature is 5 degrees C per minute maximum. The maximum slew rate in pressure is 100 PSI per minute. The repeatability is to include all effects on both the output scale an d zero point and must include, but is not limited to, all hysteresis effects. The long-term stability of the pressure transducer when exposed to the environment indicated to be 0.1 percent maximum per annum. The anticipated quantities required are 110 each with partial deliveries of 25 each to begin 30 Jan 04 with an optional item for 105 each with partial deliveries of 25 each to begin after receipt of last shipment of base item.  Under this broad agency announcement, contracts will be awarded to those contractors who are determined technically acceptable. Proposals must include the following: Offerors are requested to provide Descriptive Literature/Commercial product brochures that are typically provided for commercial sector bidding with their quote. Descriptive literature means information furnished by an offeror, such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, and brochures, that s hows a product's characteristics or construction or explains its operation. The term includes only that information required to evaluate the acceptability of the product and excludes other information for operating or maintaining the product. Descriptive literature is requested to establish, for the purpose of evaluation, details of the product offered that are specified above and pertain to significant elements, such as: (1) Design, (2) Materials, (3) Components, (4) Performance characteristics, and (5) Methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation. Descriptive literature, shall be identified to show the item(s) of the offer to which it applies. Submit pricing information separately, with unit and extended pricing information. NUWC Division Keyport anticipates issuing awards on a firm fixed price, bilateral purchase order basis. Initial awards may be placed withi n 15 days after the issuance date of this announcement.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Proposals (RFP No. JL-32903-001) An Inducible Mouse Model of Spinal Muscular Atrophy
<DESC>The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has launched the Collaborative Program to Accelerate Therapeutics Development for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).  SMA, the most common hereditary cause of infant death, is caused by the loss of function of a single gene, SMN1, which results in the death of motor neurons.  This defined target suggests tractable strategies for therapeutics development.  This program will implement a plan for rapid SMA therapeutics development through the strategic support of research projects.  The overall goal of the program is to identify a treatment for SMA.  Preproposals are requested for the development and characterization of a mouse model of SMA that can be used to determine (1) the window of requirement for SMN function in the animal and (2) the stage when increasing SMN function can alter disease progression.  In addition, we are soliciting an inducible mouse model of SMA that will be amenable to testing candidate therapies for SMA.  Responses to this RFP in the form of two-page preproposals will be due on December 22, 2003.  Preproposals will be reviewed to determine which submissions best meet the intent of the solicitation.  Offerors whose preproposals are deemed most responsive to the solicitation will be invited to submit full 10-page proposals.  For a detailed description of the aims of this RFP, the procedure for preparing a preproposal, and more information about the program, visit the SMA Project website at http://www.smaproject.org.  SAIC is supporting the NINDS in the management of this program.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by SAIC.

<SUBJECT>70 -- MAINTENANCE SUPPORT FOR AUTOMATED ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source delivery order under the General Services Administration’s (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) with Distributed Solutions, Inc. (DSI) entitled "Automated Acquisition Management System (AAMS)" which is a proprietary product of DSI.  The proposed effort will require the contractor to provide the NRC with continued maintenance support for its ProDoc and RegSearch modules for approximately thirty-two (32) users, which is currently being obtained by NRC under Delivery Order DR-01-0065.  The DSI modules are a commercial off-the-shelf software product used by the NRC as a contract writing tool (ProDoc Module) and as a regulatory update tool (RegSearch Module).  Further, under this effort, the NRC proposes to incorporate two optional requirements under the resultant delivery order which may be exercised at the discretion of the Government to:  (1) upgrade the ProDoc and RegSearch modules from its current NRC Local Area Network Server to DSI's Web-based product suite (Version 6) to include the addition of its ProTrac module which will be required for approximately 32 users (20 Division of Contracts staff users and 12 Regional Office staff users), as well as provide associated training for these upgraded modules; and (2) include an XPI  interface with the NRC's Federal Financial System (FFS).  The authority for negotiating on a sole source basis with Distributed Solutions, Inc. is found under Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 40 U.S.C. 501,  and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  The proposed period of performance for this effort is one (1) year from date of award.  The NAICS code is 511210.  The size standard for this requirement is $21.0 million.  This notice is not a request for quotations.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC’s needs.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Brenda J. DuBose, Contract Specialist at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Division of Contracts, Mail Stop T-7-I2, Washington, D.C. 20555 via mail not later than December 4, 2003.

<DESC>This is to advise that effective February 17, 2004, solicitations issued by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will include the requirements of MIL-STD-129, Revision P, dated December 5, 2002.  Revision P is the latest version of MIL-STD-129 and establishes significant new requirements for DoD contractors that ship packaged material to the Government to provide both linear and two-dimensional (2-D) bar coding on Military Shipping Labels (MSLs).  Linear Code 3 of 9 or Code 39 bar codes will continue to be required on interior packages (unit and intermediate packages) for the National Stock Number (NSN) and, when applicable, the serial number; and on shipping containers for the NSN, Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, contract number and, when applicable, the serial number.  The new requirements will not apply to delivery orders when the basic contract has not been modified to require MIL-STD-129P.  The MSL requires 3 of 9 or Code 39 linear bar codes for the Transportation Control Number (TCN), piece number, and DoD Activity Address Code (DODAAC) for the ultimate consignee or mark-for address.  The 2-D bar code on the MSL must contain the document (requisition) number, NSN, Routing Indicator Code (RIC), Unit of Issue, Quantity, Condition Code, and Unit Price, which are ordinarily included on the DD Form 250 or the DD Form 1348-1A.  MIL-STD-129P provides numerous illustrations of what must be bar-coded and the recommended placement of the bar code.  When a contract omits any data element required to be bar-coded, the field shall be zero-filled.  The DLA Packaging Web Site (http://www.dscc.dla.mil/offices/packaging/specstdslist.html#STDs) provides links to MIL-STD-129P, sources for conforming labels, and related information.
